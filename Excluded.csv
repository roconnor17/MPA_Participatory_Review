"Lessons from Philippines MPA Management: Social Ecological Interactions, Participation, and MPA Performance","Twichell, J; Pollnac, R; Christie, P","International interest in increasing marine protected area (MPA) coverage reflects broad recognition of the MPA as a key tool for marine ecosystems and fisheries management. Nevertheless, effective management remains a significant challenge. The present study contributes to enriching an understanding of best practices for MPA management through analysis of archived community survey data collected in the Philippines by the Learning Project (LP), a collaboration with United States Coral Triangle Initiative (USCTI), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and partners. We evaluate stakeholder participation and social ecological interactions among resource users in MPA programs in the Palawan, Occidental Mindoro, and Batangas provinces in the Philippines. Analysis indicates that a complex suite of social ecological factors, including demographics, conservation beliefs, and scientifically correct knowledge influence participation, which in turn is related to perceived MPA performance. Findings indicate positive feedbacks within the system that have potential to strengthen perceptions of MPA success. The results of this evaluation provide empirical reinforcement to current inquiries concerning the role of participation in influencing MPA performance.",2018,,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,61,6,916-927,WOS:000431056200003,10.1007/s00267-018-1020-y,,#19185,Twichell 2018,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Building a transnational biodiversity geo-database of the protected areas in the Adriatic-Ionian Macro-Region: approaches and results from the IMPRECO Project,"Zangaro, F; Marini, G; Specchia, V; De Luca, M; Visintin, F; Bullo, G; Richard, J; Salaja, N; Rakar, B; Lipej, B; Mrcelic, JK; Piasevoli, G; Zuljevic, A; Zaimi, N; Bejko, D; Diku, A; Karousou, A; Hatziyanni, E; Pinat, M; Pinna, M","BackgroundThe main objective of the project Common strategies and best practices to IMprove the transnational PRotection of ECOsystem integrity and services - IMPRECO is to enhance the safeguarding of ecosystems and ecosystem services. Additionally, the aim of this project is to tackle their environmental vulnerability by strengthening the potential of the Protected Areas in biodiversity, ecosystems and ecosystem services conservation. This is expected to be addressed by maintaining it through their transnational networking located in the European Adriatic-Ionian Macro-Region.New informationThe aim of this research is: 1) to characterise the habitats and ecosystems involved in the coastal-marine protected areas considered; 2) to set a biodiversity baseline; 3) to understand what current ecosystems' conditions are; 4) to build up a transnational biomonitoring programme of target species and habitats and 5) to assess their response to pilot actions. To do so, a transnational inventory of species, habitats, ecosystems and ecosystem services was established, starting with the seven coastal-marine protected areas involved in the project. Data collection was carried out using different sources of information: scientific literature, officially available data from NATURA 2000 Standard Data Forms, checklists from local biomonitoring programmes, personal observations and citizen science, historical maps and data from new in-field analyses. Data were filled in the transnational biodiversity geo-databases according to the NATURA 2000 standards about habitat features, species protection level and species features. The presence of alien species (non-indigenous species, NIS) was also acknowledged and references about data collection were provided in the databases according to the Darwin Core standards.",2021,,BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL,9,,,WOS:000655331700001,10.3897/BDJ.9.e67169,,#19192,Zangaro 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Mass mortality hits gorgonian forests at Montecristo Island,"Turicchia, E; Abbiati, M; Sweet, M; Ponti, M","Mediterranean gorgonian forests are species-rich habitats, and like many other marine habitats they are threatened by anthropogenic disturbances and mass mortality events. These mortality events have often been linked to anomalies in the temperature profiles of the Mediterranean region. On 5 September 2017, colonies of the gorgonians Eunicella singularis and Eunicella cavolini exhibited rapid tissue loss, down to a depth of 30 m along the steep cliffs of Montecristo Island, Tuscan Archipelago National Park, Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy. Interestingly, Montecristo has previously been identified as a reference site for the ecological quality assessment of the western Mediterranean benthic assemblages on rocky bottoms. The observed mortality event occurred during a period of increased sea temperature. By utilising a combination of high-resolution oceanographic analysis, forecast models and citizen science initiatives, we propose that an early warning system for the concomitance of heat waves and mortality events can be put in place. A temperature-based coral disease surveillance tool could then be established for the entire Mediterranean Sea. Such a tool would allow for the timely study of mass mortality phenomena and the implementation of prompt mitigation and/or restoration initiatives. Finally, this specific mortality event, in a Marine Protected Area, offers a unique opportunity to monitor and assess the resilience of gorgonian populations and associated benthic assemblages in the absence of other, more directly, anthropogenic disturbances such as pollution and land runoff.",2018,,DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS,131,1,79-85,WOS:000449164200008,10.3354/dao03284,,#19204,Turicchia 2018,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,Proposed
"Combining human preference and biodiversity priorities for marine protected area site selection in Sabah, Malaysia","Teh, LCL; Teh, LSL; Jumin, R","High human reliance on marine resources in developing countries is a challenge for implementing marine protected areas, which usually seek to limit or restrict fishing in selected areas. Fishers' spatial preferences should be considered during the site selection process, but biodiversity considerations are generally the primary focus. The Protected Area Suitability Index (PASI) is a fuzzy logic spatial planning tool that combines human preferences and conservation criteria to assess the suitability of marine sites for being protected from fishing and other extractive use. We apply the PASI in zoning a marine sanctuary in Sabah, Malaysia, with the objectives of (i) assessing the PASI's ability to capture fishers' spatial preferences; and (ii) comparing the nuances of community based and fuzzy logic approaches in spatial planning. There was overlap in sites chosen for protection by both approaches, and multi-dimensional scaling results suggest that the PASI captures fishers' preferences. Community consultations enable direct integration of local knowledge to fill gaps in scientific knowledge, but can be time consuming and expensive. The PASI is an alternative to data and labour intensive conservation planning tools that are currently available, and can be particularly useful for zoning marine protected areas in data poor developing countries where conservation requires quick action.

Community conserved areas: policy issues in historic and contemporary context,"Berkes, F","Indigenous and community conserved areas (ICCAs) are natural and/or modified ecosystems containing biodiversity values, ecological services, and cultural values, voluntarily conserved by indigenous and other communities through local or customary laws. They are found in both terrestrial and marine areas; they range in size from <1 ha sacred groves to >30,000 km(2) indigenous territories in Brazil. ICCAs should be recognized for what they may contribute to national and global conservation systems, but there is little documentation of their potential or discussion of their policy implications. Here I examine the historic and contemporary context of ICCAs, provide examples, and raise policy issues related to: assessing the conservation benefits of ICCAs, integrating traditional knowledge into protected area management, finding the right mix of governance regimes, and dealing with challenges faced by them.",2009,,CONSERVATION LETTERS,2,1,19-24,WOS:000279223300003,10.1111/j.1755-263X.2008.00040.x,,#19224,Berkes 2009,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Co-management and adaptive co-management: Two modes of governance in a Honduran marine protected area,"Bown, NK; Gray, TS; Stead, SM","Selecting the best mode of governance for marine protected areas (MPAs) especially in developing countries has generated considerable controversy in the academic and policy literature during the last 20 years. In this article, two modes - co-management (CM) and adaptive co-management (ACM) - are analysed in detail, and an examination is made of an attempt to put these modes sequentially into practice in the first (2003-2009) and second (2008-2013) management plans, respectively, of the Cayos Cochinos MPA (CCMPA) in Honduras. Extensive fieldwork was carried out during 2006-2010 in three communities dependent on the CCMPA (Rio Esteban, Nueva Armenia, and Chachahuate) including key informant interviews, focus group meetings, household surveys, and participant observation. The paper's findings are (1) that while the first plan implemented some CM principles (such as sharing responsibility between government, stakeholders and NGOs) it failed to deliver other CM principles (such as transparency and accountability); and (2) that while the second plan increased participation and transparency, and used a more adaptive approach, it still left many stakeholders out of the decision-making process, and its processes of experimentation, monitoring and social learning were very limited. The fact is that CM and ACM are laudable objectives, but very difficult to implement in full. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Gaining Legitimacy and Losing Trust: Stakeholder Participation in Ecological Risk Assessment for Marine Protected Area Management,"Treffny, R; Beilin, R","This study examines the application of a qualitative Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) tool to initiate management planning and community engagement in newly legislated Marine Protected Areas. Scientists and the agency expected the participatory element to increase the legitimacy of management by achieving consensus about management priorities as well as to engender trust in science and agency procedures. We point to the complex nature of participatory engagement when expert and lay knowledge are combined while an agency's claim to legitimacy rests on scientific judgements. While community engagement offered agency staff an additional way to claim legitimacy it also challenged the way planners, rangers as well as community representatives previously attained trust.",2011,,ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES,20,3,417-438,WOS:000293438800009,10.3197/096327111X13077055166144,,#19241,Treffny 2011,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
"Detecting, counting and following the giants of the sea: a review of monitoring methods for aquatic megavertebrates in the Caribbean","Castelblanco-Martinez, DN; Blanco-Parra, MP; Charruau, P; Prezas, B; Zamora-Vilchis, I; Nino-Torres, CA","The Caribbean is a mega-diverse and bio-geographically important region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands, and surrounding coastlines. Among the billions of aquatic species inhabiting this region, the mega-vertebrates stand out for their social, economic and ecologic relevance. However, the Caribbean has been threatened by climate change, poverty, pollution, environmental degradation and intense growth of the tourism industry, affecting megafauna species directly and indirectly. Population monitoring plays a critical role in an informed conservation process and helps guide management decisions at several scales. The aim of the present review was to critically examine the methods employed for monitoring marine megafauna in the Caribbean, so as to create a framework for future monitoring efforts. In total, 235 documents describing protocols for the monitoring of sirenians, cetaceans, elasmobranchs, sea turtles and crocodilians in the Caribbean region, were reviewed. The methods included community-based monitoring (interviews, citizen science and fisheries monitoring), aerial surveys (by manned and unmanned aerial vehicles), boat-based surveys (including manta tow, and side-scan sonars), land-based surveys, acoustic monitoring, underwater surveys, baited remote underwater video, mark-recapture, photo-identification and telemetry. Monitoring efforts invested on aquatic megafauna in the Caribbean have been highly different, with some species and/or groups being prioritised over others. The present critical review provides a country-based overview of the current and emerging methods for monitoring marine megafauna and a critical evaluation of their known advantages, disadvantages and biases.",2019,,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,46,7,545-556,WOS:000493548200001,10.1071/WR19008,,#19276,Castelblanco-Martinez 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Comparing and Integrating Community-Based and Science-Based Approaches to Prioritizing Marine Areas for Protection,"Ban, NC; Picard, CR; Vincent, ACJ","We compared and integrated marine protected areas proposed through community and scientific assessments in 2 regions of British Columbia, Canada. The community priorities were identified during individual and group interviews with knowledgeable resource users. The scientific priorities were developed with abiotic and biotic data in Marxan, a decision-support tool. The resulting maps of community-based and science-based priorities were very similar for the inshore areas, which lent credibility to both approaches. The resource users thought the science-based maps were fairly good at highlighting areas important for conservation, but preferred the scenarios that integrated the 2 maps to either constituent map. Incorporating spatial variation in human impacts on the marine areas and commercial fishing, which are both costs of protection, into our Marxan analyses led to scenarios that were different from either constituent map. Our results show the value of integrating community-based and science-based approaches in conservation planning to achieve community acceptance and conservation utility. They also reveal that people's assessments on the basis of their traditional ecological knowledge may serve as a reasonable proxy for scientific approaches in selecting areas of ecological value.",2009,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,23,4,899-910,WOS:000268028800021,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01185.x,,#19278,Ban 2009,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Holistic investigation of shore angler profiles to support marine protected areas management,"Cambra, E; Bello, A; Kayal, M; Lenfant, P; Vasseur, L; Verdoit-Jarraya, M","Marine Recreational Fishing (MRF) is growing worldwide in scientific interest, as evidenced by the increasing number of dedicated publications. Studies on the impacts and benefits to socio-ecosystems and mental health are driving this gradual awareness. In the Mediterranean, MRF is currently responsible for 10% of the catches though, in the context of small-scale fisheries decline, it may become dominant. Sustaining this activity represents a universal challenge for the future of mankind. However, the potential influence of anglers? heterogeneity on both the environment and the Catch Per Unit of Effort (CPUE), used internationally to evaluate fish harvest and as a stocks indicator, hinders MRF management. In addition, little data is available on onshore fishing, while the number of practitioners may increase sharply in the context of a socio-economic crisis, especially in marine protected areas (MPA). We conducted a year-round survey in 2017?2018 in a French Mediterranean MPA subject to tourist flows, during which 144 onshore anglers were polled by semi-directive interviews. We used a typology based on technical and socio-economic data of anglers to describe their behaviour diversity and its influence on CPUE and, more broadly, the marine environment in multi-species fisheries. We characterised four onshore angler profiles, segregated in space and time, including one identified as at risk of causing impacts. Our analyses support using total and per species CPUE independently of profiles to evaluate onshore MRF harvest, except for four species. CPUE seem based on the profiles? skills and self-regulation which induce similar yields between anglers in the absence of control. This demonstrates the importance of taking into account angler behaviour, as each profile could react differently to management actions and highlights that CPUE could be used to detect the effect of changes in regulation in the framework of adaptive management. Our results support that MRF regulations should be simplified and homogenised at the national level and cooperation with fishing shops in MPA co management should be promoted.",2021,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,285,,,WOS:000632613900001,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112089,,#19282,Cambra 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Marine conservation in remote small island settings: Factors influencing marine protected area establishment in the Azores,"Abecasis, RC; Longnecker, N; Schmidt, L; Clifton, J","This paper examines the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) in remote small island settings with specific reference to the Portuguese island of Corvo in the Azores. This case study represents different approaches to marine conservation, ranging from an informal community-based no-take MPA to a government-driven multi-purpose natural park, involving diverse local and external actors interacting over an extended period of time. In-depth interviews were used to explore the perceptions of local and expert stakeholders about positive and negative aspects of MPA establishment. This demonstrated how differing approaches have led to varying degrees of MPA effectiveness. From the community-based MPA, several key ingredients for effective MPA establishment were identified, including engaging and empowering local communities, clear definition of goals, visible MPA outputs and community enforcement based on high levels of support and peer group pressure. However, in a context of complex marine resource use, the limitations of community-based initiatives prevent them from achieving broad ecosystem conservation goals. These might be better achieved through government-driven MPAs, provided that they are integrated in a wider regional marine strategy and that there is political will to effectively implement conservation measures and to allocate resources for management, enforcement and monitoring.

"Stakeholder Opinions on the Assessment of MPA Effectiveness and Their Interests to Participate at Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, Canada","Heck, N; Dearden, P; McDonald, A; Carver, S","As the number of marine protected areas (MPAs) is globally increasing, information is needed on the effectiveness of existing sites. Many protected area agencies however have limited resources and are unable to evaluate MPA effectiveness. An evaluation conducted entirely by the managing agency may also lack credibility. Long-term monitoring and evaluation programs should ideally offer opportunities for participation of diverse groups in the selection of evaluation indicators and their assessment. A participatory approach has the potential to enhance evaluation capacity, to increase credibility and acceptance of results, to strengthen relationships between managers and local stakeholders, and to address more locally relevant information. Using a case study approach, this paper investigates diverse stakeholder groups' opinions on the design of an evaluation and their interest to participate in an assessment. Respondents were most interested in the assessment of MPA achievements and outcome indicators. Most groups identified a range of government agencies and stakeholders that should participate in an assessment but only half of all respondents were interested to participate in monitoring activities. Most frequently mentioned limitations for more participation were a lack of time and money, but also governance shortcomings such as limited participation possibilities and not paying enough credit to stakeholders' input. Participation interest was also influenced by occupation, place of residency, and familiarity with the marine environment. Differences exist among stakeholders about suitable evaluators and preferred monitoring partners, which could affect the credibility of evaluation results and affect monitoring activities.",2011,,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,47,4,603-616,WOS:000289366400009,10.1007/s00267-010-9609-9,,#19289,Heck 2011,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Restoration of Abundance and Dynamics of Coastal Fish and Lobster Within Northern Marine Protected Areas Across Two Decades,"Moland, E; Fernandez-Chacon, A; Sordalen, TK; Villegas-Rios, D; Thorbjornsen, SH; Halvorsen, KT; Huserbraten, M; Olsen, EM; Kleiven, PJN; Kleiven, AR; Knutsen, H; Espeland, SH; Freitas, C; Knutsen, JA","This article reviews a suite of studies conducted in a network of coastal Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Skagerrak, Southeast Norway. In 2006, Norway's first lobster reserves were implemented, with the aim of protecting European lobster (Homarus gammarus) through a ban on fixed gear. A before-after control-impact paired series (BACIPS) monitoring program was initiated to evaluate effects of protection on depleted lobster populations. Experimental trapping and capture-recapture techniques were combined to track demography of populations, also including movement of individuals within and beyond MPAs and adjacent control areas. Further, population genetics and parentage studies were applied, allowing for estimation of gene flow, and novel work on sexual selection in lobsters. Additional studies have evaluated MPA effects on coastal cod (Gadus morhua), and on commercially harvested labrids (Ctenolabrus rupestris and Symphodus melops) and anadromous brown trout (Salmo trutta). Together, these studies reported effects of protection pertaining to increased population density, survival, body size and phenotypic diversity, changes in emigration and interaction with surrounding fisheries, and alteration of selection pressure on morphological- and behavioral traits. Designation of MPAs in close collaboration with fishers and managers, long-term monitoring, inclusion of citizen science and evolving research protocols-also including fisheries data-have revealed novel effects of protection and harvesting on marine populations, thus providing substantial contributions to conservation science.

A governance analysis of two marine protected areas in the Pacific Region of Guatemala: The Multiple Use Area of Monterrico and the Private Reserve La Chorrera-Manchon Guamuchal,"Gonzalez-Bernat, MJ; Clifton, J","This paper presents an analysis of key elements contributing towards current and future prospects for governance in two MPAs in the Pacific Region of Guatemala. The paper follows the Marine Protected Area Governance (MPAG) empirical framework through the use of economic, interpretative, knowledge, legal and participative incentives that assess the effectiveness of governance. The first MPA is the Multiple Use Area of Monterrico that is governed through a co-management approach by the Centre of Conservation Studies of the University of San Carlos de Guatemala (CECON-USAC), whilst the second is Guatemala's only privately-owned marine protected area, La Chorrera-Manchon Guamuchal Reserve. The results highlight that the differences in the way they are governed have significantly shaped the effectiveness of governance. In the case of Monterrico, the limited state capacity and cross-jurisdictional coordination among stakeholders has resulted in weak economic and legal incentives, where efforts have failed to develop the necessary participatory approach to management. As a result, environmental degradation and increasing urban development is apparent, which have proven difficult to manage by the park management authority. Conversely, La Chorrera-Manch on Guamuchal has developed a governance approach based on local community involvement, which has proven successful for conservation and management initiatives for the reserve. Management is characterized by strong leadership, which has proven to be the underlying difference in both MPAs. However, the fate of the reserve is uncertain, as there is no long-term planning for success. Future prospects for effective governance are recommended, where efforts should primarily foster state involvement and political will.",2021,,MARINE POLICY,127,,,WOS:000663338400012,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103625,,#19297,Gonzalez-Bernat 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Evidence of economic benefits for public investment in MPAs,"Pascal, N; Brathwaite, A; Brander, L; Seidl, A; Philip, M; Clua, E","MPAs enhance some of the Ecosystem Services (ES) provided by coral reefs and clear, robust valuations of these impacts may help to improve stakeholder support and better inform decision-makers. Pursuant to this goal, Cost-Benefit Analyses (CBA) of MPAs in 2 different contexts were analysed: a community based MPA with low tourism pressure in Vanuatu, and a government managed MPA with relatively high tourism pressure, in Saint Martin. Assessments were made on six ES: fish biomass, scenic beauty, protection against coastal erosion, bequest and existence values, social capital and CO2 sequestration, which were quantified via different approaches that included experimental fishery, surveys and benefit transfer. Total operating costs for each MPA were collected and the benefit-cost ratio and return on investment based on 25-year discounted projections computed. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on MPA impacts, and discount rates (5%, 7% and 10%). The investment indicators all showed positive results with the impact on the tourism ES being the largest estimated for all MPAs, highlighting the importance of this relationship. The study also demonstrated a relatively high sensitivity of the results to different levels of impacts on ES, which highlights the need for reducing scientific knowledge gaps. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The Role of Citizen Science in Monitoring Megafauna of the Red Sea,"Mancini, A; Elsadek, IM","Citizen science is an innovative approach that relies on non-specialists to monitor species and ecosystems over long time periods and vast geographical areas. Citizen science has been used extensively in marine science to monitor endangered species such as sharks and marine turtles, coral reefs and their associated fish species, marine mammals, invasive species and, more recently, coral bleaching and marine litter. Engaging people over the long term can be challenging but using social media, gamification, and emphasizing the value of volunteer contributions through data sharing, can help to keep communities motivated. In the Red Sea, there is enormous potential for using citizen science in monitoring endangered species and ecosystems due to the presence of a fleet of safari boats and dive centres going to sea daily. Engaging with this sector and creating long lasting partnerships for data collection through simple protocols could be a winning approach to obtain important information from remote areas and/or on rare species. In this chapter, we present the preliminary results of a citizen science program targeting marine turtles in their feeding grounds in the Egyptian Red Sea waters that was conducted from 2011 to 2013. During the study period 2,448 surveys were completed at 157 sites and included a total of 1,038 sightings of turtles. The most commonly observed species were hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) and green (Chelonia mydas) turtles; however, rarer species, such as loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) turtles were also recorded. Among the sites that were monitored, some were considered as important for turtles (i.e., had a high probability of observing a turtle), while in others, turtles were not observed despite carrying out multiple surveys. Participants reported turtles of various sizes and ages with adults and sub-adults being the predominant observed age class. The presence of adults seemed to be related to the nesting season (May-September), which was also when the survey effort was higher. Adult male turtles were observed on various occasions, providing important input on their whereabouts during nesting and non-nesting seasons. Finally, participants detected behaviour that had not been previously described in the region, such as courting and mating. Results from TurtleWatch Egypt provided new insight in our knowledge of marine turtles in the Red Sea, especially from the largely under-studied feeding grounds.",2019,,OCEANOGRAPHIC AND BIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE RED SEA,,,507-519,WOS:000482664300029,10.1007/978-3-319-99417-8_2810.1007/978-3-319-99417-8,,#19303,Mancini 2019,Exclusion reason: Not a peer-reviewed article; ,
"Integration process and stakeholders' interactions analysis around a protection project: Case of the National park of Gouraya, Algeria (South-western Mediterranean)","Boumaour, A; Grimes, S; Brigand, L; Larid, M","Among the most important instruments used for the protection of the Mediterranean marine environment, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have demonstrated their efficiency in the preservation of sensitive marine ecosystems and the sustainable management of their resources. In Algeria, only two sites are officially classified as ""Specially Protected Area of Mediterranean Importance"" and six others are in project, including the extension of the coastal National Park of Gouraya (NPG) to the marine area. This paper addresses the issue of stakeholder involvement in the governance process of high ecological coastal protected areas, highly coveted and exposed to the constraints related to the multiplicity of actors. This study is considered as an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) mini-project based on the steps set out in the ICZM Mediterranean Protocol and inspired by the concept founded on ecosystem approach of problems by associating multiple stakeholders around a common project. The management process of the NPG and the involvement of actors were evaluated through direct interviews and a stakeholder analysis using the ""MACTOR"" method. Results indicate that the current management and the local context are not mature regarding the involvement of the actors.

"Linking social organization, attitudes, and stakeholder empowerment in MPA governance","de Oliveira, JGC; Campos-Silva, JV; Ladle, RJ; Batista, VD","The last two decades has seen a global trend in Marine Protected Area (MPA) management from top-down to more bottom-up approaches. Moreover, recent research suggests that evaluation of MPA performance should be participative, fully engaging multiple stakeholders, including local community representatives, in the assessment process. The effectiveness of such an approach to evaluation will be largely dependent on the stakeholders' level of awareness and knowledge of MPA governance principles, though this has rarely been systematically investigated. Here, we assess the capacity of diverse MPA stakeholders to evaluate their MPA using data from interviews with MPA managers, fishers, representatives of the local government and others. We used structured questionnaires to evaluate the level of consensus in attitudes among stakeholders from groups with different levels of social organization. We found that there was significantly low consensus among local community stakeholder groups and high among managers. Our findings also suggest that governance principles are holistically assessed on participative evaluations involving all main stakeholders involved. Based on our results, we propose a participative framework for governance assessment to facilitate the identification of convergence (consensus) and divergence (conflicts) among stakeholder groups.",2021,,MARINE POLICY,130,,,WOS:000670179900011,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104543,,#19310,deOliveira 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Cost-Benefit Study of Marine Protected Areas: Implications on Financing and Institutional Needs,"Butardo-Toribio, MZ; Alino, PM; Guiang, ES","Six marine protected areas (MPAs) under various management arrangements were studied in the Philippines to estimate the costs and benefits of establishing MPAs and how these costs and benefits are shared on-site in order to gain insights on financing and institutional needs of MPAs. Data came from key informant interviews, focus group discussions, biophysical monitoring results and secondary sources. External financial and technical assistance, community volunteer labor, networking and partnerships played an important role in defraying the financial costs of the MPAs studied. Biophysical monitoring results provided inferential support to community anecdotes about improving fish catch and coral conditions as well as socio-economic and ecological benefits from MPA establishment.

Integrating environmental education in marine protected areas management in Colombia,"Zorrilla-Pujana, J; Rossi, S","Environmental Education (EE) is a key component in any marine protected area management. However, its visibility and action plans are still poorly developed and structured as a clear element in management procedures. The objective of this study is to contribute with a methodological route that integrates EE to the existing model of management planning and strategies, taking the Colombian National Natural Parks System as a case study. The creation of the route is proposed as a participatory research with different stakeholders in order to respond to the specific conservation needs and goals for the National Parks System. The EE national diagnosis has shown that its integration within the parks management structure is a first priority need, being a converging result on the two case studies on National Parks from the Pacific Coast of Colombia. The diagnosis also demonstrates that communication, participation, training and evaluation have to be reinforced, linking the community and stakeholders involved in the park management to the whole EE process. The proposed methodology route has been agreed upon by the National Parks staff and incorporates advice and recommendations from different stakeholders, in order to better include the park users. This step will help us to advance toward sustainable management in marine and coastal protected areas elsewhere, taking into account not only the biological but also the social cultural prism.

Diving into science and conservation: recreational divers can monitor reef assemblages,"Vieira, EA; de Souza, LR; Longo, GO","Overfishing, pollution and global changes threaten reef ecosystems all over the world and several conservation actions emerged to reduce and mitigate such impacts. Citizen-based programs with hands-on conservation experience and voluntarily data collection are a successful way of involving society in the conservation process. We developed and tested a citizen-based monitoring protocol to monitor reef fish and sea turtles during regular recreational diving operations, with minimum impact on the routine of the diving company. We compared data collected by volunteer divers and by trained scientists using this protocol, and assessed the influence of the volunteersdiving experience in data collection. We found that recreational divers were able to record all the species included in the monitoring slate, providing estimates of species abundance and composition that did not differ from those obtained by trained scientific divers using the same protocol. This method also recorded large reef species, such as rays, sharks and turtles more effectively in comparison to traditional scientific surveys conducted in the same area. Such difference indicates complementarity between the citizen-based monitoring protocol and traditional scientific monitoring methods. The diving experience of recreational divers did not affect their ability to characterize reef assemblages and most volunteers provided a positive feedback of their experience as citizen-scientists. Therefore, recreational divers can be powerful citizen-scientists and implementing similar monitoring protocols in reef areas, particularly in marine protected areas where diving activities are allowed and regulated, seems feasible and a good way to engage divers in data collection and marine conservation.

Learning through experience: Non-implementation and the challenges of protected area conservation in The Bahamas,"Wise, SP","Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are increasingly promoted as policy tools to counter such problems as declining fisheries, habitat destruction, and biodiversity loss. Many proposed MPAs become stalled in the implementation process, highlighting the need for further research into the processes leading to non-implementation:This paper focuses on two proposed MPAs in The Bahamas undergoing protected area enclosure: one highly controversial MPA in North Bimini that was proposed in 2000, but with an uncertain future; and a second enclosure in Andros Island initiated in 2002 and enlarged in 2009 after years of outreach and assessment. Although both locations seek to protect an area of shallow seas within The Bahamas archipelago, each area is significantly different in its management goals as well as social and institutional frameworks. A comparison of the two MPAs underscores the challenges in implementing changes in marine governance while illustrating opportunities for adaptive social learning in resource management processes. There are three goals to this analysis: (1) to explore the processes leading to non-implementation of proposed MPAs; (2) to identify some conditions for success and failure of MPAs within The Bahamian context; and (3) to search for evidence of individual and institutional learning in how conservation agents have approached the later Andros MPA. Research suggests that while there may be ample opportunity to learn from failed conservation attempts, individual and institutional constraints inhibit successful conservation planning frequently leading to non-implementation.

Creating a TURF from the bottom-up: Antigua's community-based coral reef no-take reserve,"Camacho, RA; Steneck, RS","Antigua's coral reefs are among the most degraded in the Caribbean region, having low coral cover, few herbivores, and abundant harmful macroalgae. Low fish biomass suggests overfishing may contribute to degradation and lack of recovery to a coral-dominated state. However, coral reefs declined so long ago that most stakeholders have never seen a healthy reef ecosystem. Therefore, fishers today may not be able to imagine ecosystem services provided by healthy reefs. No-take reserves can reverse degradation by increasing herbivore abundance, reducing macroalgae, and increasing juvenile coral abundance, which, with time, should increase coral cover. Although Antigua designated marine protected areas, they are functionally ""paper parks"" with low compliance due to inadequate management and enforcement, and little community support. In 2014, we conducted meetings and interviews with fishers resulting in a community-based, no-take reserve managed by fishers in their fishing territory, which is unprecedented in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Our objective was to create a demonstration project for the fishing community so they can see the effects and profit from spillover of adults into the area they fish. Fishers interviewed described their perspective of the reef and the history of fishing. They supported the creation of a demonstration reserve and assisted in monitoring for compliance. This is the first collective action known to have occurred among Antiguan fishers. After 1 yr, biomass increased significantly in the reserve for all targeted fish species and for non-target species. One year after the reserve was established, parrotfish biomass increased and macroalgae decreased significantly based on repeated belt and point-intercept transects, respectively.",2017,,BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE,93,1,217-232,WOS:000393731900013,10.5343/bms.2015.1096,,#19358,Camacho 2017,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Moving beyond a top-down fisheries management approach in the northwestern Mediterranean: Some lessons from the Philippines,"Arceo, HO; Cazalet, B; Alino, PM; Mangialajo, L; Francour, P","The management of fisheries resources in the northwestern Mediterranean is traditionally centralized and developed within the framework of coastal states and European Union common policies. In general, it has not been sufficiently effective in reversing the declining situation of fisheries resources and fishers in this region. This paper discusses the feasibility of moving away from a top-down approach in fisheries management towards a more participative and convergent mode of governance in the region. More specifically, the study focuses on MPAs as a fisheries management tool and evaluates their current establishment and management system in the French Mediterranean as a case study for the region. A brief review of the experiences on fisheries and MPA management in the Philippines is also presented to obtain insights on bottom-up and collaborative management approaches. Finally, possible opportunities for adopting a more decentralized and coordinated approach in fisheries management within the French socio-political system, and possibly in the northwestern Mediterranean region, are discussed. These include the existence of fishing community organizations in the region, such as the prud'homies in France and cofradias in Spain, starting with management strategies that are simpler to enforce and more acceptable to direct users, e.g., fishery reserves, and exploring co-management arrangements to manage fisheries at ecologically meaningful but operationally manageable scales as has been proposed by some development organizations. However, effective changes in the system would require major national policy and institutional reforms, social preparation and organizational strengthening which would take time and resources.

The effectiveness of sectoral integration between marine protected area and fisheries agencies: An Australian case study,"Read, AD; West, RJ","In order to manage Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) effectively, cooperative coordination arrangements between MPA and fisheries agencies are essential, but are recognised as very difficult to achieve. Barriers to, and benefits of, developing partnerships between these agencies have been reviewed and a comprehensive list of 46 specific performance indicators to evaluate MPA and fisheries agency partnership effectiveness has been compiled. These indicators have been linked to the USAID Policy and Coordination Program's partnership assessment framework that applies three evaluation domains, namely: strategic values and capacity to implement, operational processes and resultant impact of a partnership. In a case study designed to test the methodology, the IUCN MPA assessment guidelines and these performance indicators were used as the basis for an evaluation of the effectiveness of an Australian MPA and fisheries inter-agency partnership. This provided a rapid, qualitative evaluation methodology, which indicated that the partnership investigated had resulted in positive impacts in respect to MPA management objectives. However, the evaluation process also identified areas that could be improved, particularly in respect to the agencies' shared values and operational processes. For example, community and stakeholder communication and engagement is an important objective in MPA management, which needs mutual support from both agencies, but this activity scored lowly in the evaluation. As a result, it was recommended that MPA and fisheries agencies should develop formal agreements, such as Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs), and that these agreements should include shared objectives and targets, incentives for both agencies, co-ordinated communication processes and a risk management strategy.

Participation in devolved commons management: Multiscale socioeconomic factors related to individuals' participation in community-based management of marine protected areas in Indonesia,"Gurney, GG; Cinner, JE; Sartin, J; Pressey, RL; Ban, NC; Marshall, NA; Prabuning, D","Management of common-pool natural resources is commonly implemented under institutional models promoting devolved decision-making, such as co-management and community-based management. Although participation of local people is critical to the success of devolved commons management, few studies have empirically investigated how individuals' participation is related to socioeconomic factors that operate at multiple scales. Here, we evaluated how individual- and community-scale factors were related to levels of individual participation in management of community-based marine protected areas in Indonesia. In addressing this aim, we drew on multiple bodies of literature on human behaviour from economics and social science, including the social-ecological systems framework from the literature on common-pool resources, the theory of planned behaviour from social psychology, and public goods games from behavioural economics. We found three key factors related to level of participation of local people: subjective norms, structural elements of social capital, and nested institutions. There was also suggestive evidence that participation was related to people's cooperative behavioural disposition, which we elicited using a public goods game. These results point to the importance of considering socioeconomic factors that operate at multiple scales when examining individual behaviour. Further, our study highlights the need to consider multiscale mechanisms other than those designed to appeal to self interested concerns, such as regulations and material incentives, which are typically employed in devolved commons management to encourage participation. Increased understanding of the factors related to participation could facilitate better targeting of investments aimed at encouraging cooperative management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A new approach to selecting Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in the Southern Ocean,"Harris, J; Haward, M; Jabour, J; Woehler, EJ","Conservation of the high seas marine environment poses a significant challenge to policy-makers and managers. Marine conservation efforts are often hindered by the lack of data and the difficulties in addressing multiple, and typically conflicting uses. The majority of extant Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are in coastal or tropical regions within national jurisdiction. Conservation of high seas MPAs has emerged on the international agenda as a critical issue requiring the application of novel approaches, international cooperation and political will. Knowledge and understanding of the marine environment and data on marine biodiversity are all typically limited for the high seas, and the use of surrogates to assist in the identification of areas of high conservation value is one possible mechanism to address and potentially overcome these limitations. Drawing upon a database spanning more than 20 years and containing approximately 140 000 records of seabird sightings at sea, this study assesses the potential use of seabirds as surrogates for marine biodiversity in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean.

Mekong river fish conservation zones in southern Laos: Assessing effectiveness using local ecological knowledge,"Baird, IG; Flaherty, MS","Small-scale fisheries are important in Laos, where rural people heavily depend upon Mekong River and tributary fish stocks for their livelihoods. Increasing pressures from human exploitation and habitat disturbance, however, have raised serious concerns about the potential depletion of various species. This has led to the establishment of large numbers of Fish Conservation Zones (FCZs) or ""no-take"" fish sanctuaries in southern Laos based on a ""community-based fisheries co-management"" framework. This study uses the local ecological knowledge (LEK) of fishers to assess the effectiveness of village-managed FCZs in enhancing fish stocks in the mainstream Mekong River in Khong District, Champasak Province. Focus group interviews about species that are believed to have benefited from different FCZs are compared with parameters such as FCZ area, age, depth, localized gradient, water velocity, and the presence of wetland forests nearby. The results suggest that no one aspect is likely to account for variations in fish stocks; rather, it is the interaction between numerous factors that has the largest impact. Secondly, the results indicate that microhabitat diversity and protection are critical for maintaining and enhancing Mekong fisheries. Deep-water pools are particularly important as dry season refuges for many fish species, and FCZ depth may be the single most important environmental factor affecting the success of FCZs in the Mekong River, FCZs have the most potential to benefit relatively sedentary species, but may also benefit highly migratory species, given the right conditions. This study shows that integrated approaches to stock assessment that employ LEK and scientific fisheries management have considerable potential for improving Mekong capture-fisheries management.",2005,,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,36,3,439-454,WOS:000231959000009,10.1007/s00267-005-3093-7,,#19376,Baird 2005,Exclusion reason: Wrong setting; Ryan OConnor (2022-07-14 05:08:02)(Select): Not in the ocean - this is a river system; ,
From Fishing Fish to Fishing Data: The Role of Artisanal Fishers in Conservation and Resource Management in Mexico,"Fulton, S; Hernandez-Velasco, A; Suarez-Castillo, A; Melo, FFR; Rojo, M; Saenz-Arroyo, A; Weaver, AH; Cudney-Bueno, R; Micheli, F; Torre, J","Although, the involvement of artisanal fishing communities in conservation and management is now commonplace, their participation rarely goes beyond providing local and traditional knowledge to visiting scientists and managers. Communities are often excluded from ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and decision-making, even though these measures can have tremendous impacts on their livelihoods. For the past 17 years, we have designed, tested, and implemented a community-based monitoring model in three key marine ecosystems in Mexico: the kelp forests of Pacific Baja California, the rocky reefs of the Gulf of California, and the coral reefs of the Mesoamerican Reef System. This model is intended to engage local fishers in data collection by fulfilling two principal objectives: (1) to achieve science-based conservation and management decisions and (2) to improve livelihoods through access to knowledge and temporary employment. To achieve these goals, over 400 artisanal fishers and community members have participated in a nationwide marine reserve program. Of these, 222 fishers, including 30 women, have been trained to conduct an underwater visual census using SCUBA gear, and, to date, over 12,000 transects have been completed. Independent scientists periodically evaluate the training process and standards, and the data contribute to international monitoring efforts.

Vertical Zoning in Marine Protected Areas: Ecological Considerations for Balancing Pelagic Fishing with Conservation of Benthic Communities,"Grober-Dunsmore, R; Wooninck, L; Field, J; Ainsworth, C; Beets, J; Berkeley, S; Bohnsack, J; Boulon, R; Brodeur, R; Brodziak, J; Crowder, L; Gleason, D; Hixon, M; Kaufman, L; Lindberg, B; Miller, M; Morgan, L; Wahle, C","Marine protected areas (MPAs), ideally, manage human uses that threaten ecosystems, or components of ecosystems. During several recent MPA designation processes, concerns have arisen over the scientific justification for no-take MPAs, particularly those that restrict recreational fishing for pelagic species. An important question is: under what conditions might recreational pelagic fishing be compatible with the conservation goals of an MPA that is primarily focused on benthic Communities? In 2005, an expert workshop of fisheries biologists, marine ecologists, MPA managers, and recreational fishermen was convened by NOAAs National MPA Center to evaluate the limited empirical data on benthic-pelagic coupling and to help provide practical advice on this topic. The participants (i) proposed a preliminary conceptual framework for addressing vertical zoning, (ii) developed preliminary guidelines to consider when evaluating whether to allow or restrict pelagic fishing in an MPA, and (iii) identified future research priorities for understanding benthic-pelagic Coupling. A Suite of ecological conditions where recreational pelagic fishing may not be compatible with benthic conservation were identified: (1) high relief habitats, (2) depths shallower than 50-100 m (depending upon the specific location), (3) major topographic and oceanographic features, and (4) spawning areas. Similarly, pelagic fishing is not likely to affect benthic communities adversely in many circumstances.

Adaptive-participative sustainability indicators in marine protected areas: Design and communication,"Marques, AS; Ramos, TB; Caeiro, S; Costa, MH","Recently there has been an effort to put in practice integrated management plans in Marine Protected Areas (MPA) not only because of their high natural and cultural importance but also due to usual conflicts related to local activities. These plans should include the use of adaptive sustainability indicators that reflect stakeholders concerns, and community interests, allowing a better assessment, management and reporting. An adequate set of indicators for the MPA should help their managers to improve management policies in order to achieve better decision making processes. This study aimed to develop a set of adaptive-participative sustainability indicators (SDI) for the assessment, management and reporting of MPAs that include, through the all process, the participation of local stakeholders at every levels, integrating the stakeholders knowledge and perceptions about the SDI meaning and a self-assessment of the SDI state produced also by the stakeholders. The proposed approach was tested in Luiz Saldanha's Marine Park, located in South East of Portugal between the municipalities of Sesimbra and Setithal. The framework to design the SDI comprised four phases: i) an international analysis of SDI sets for coastal zones and MPAs; ii) a participatory process, where the stakeholders had the possibility to state their concerns through an online and face to face questionnaire surveys about the strengths and weaknesses of the MPA; iii) an analysis conducted by a team of experts to reach a set of indicators that include the main relevant aspects of environmental, socioeconomic, and governance issues, taking into account the information from the first two phases and iv) a workshop and questionnaires held to assess the stake-holders' global views and perception about the selected set of indicators and each indicator's relative importance. This study showed the importance of a dynamic participative process involving the local stakeholders. It is concluded that this methodology allows a better understanding of each indicator by the local stakeholders and how it could respond to their concerns. It should also help the MPA managers, to define the most suitable management actions and monitor the management plan itself.

Do managers and stakeholders have congruent perceptions on marine protected area management effectiveness?,"Giglio, VJ; Moura, RL; Gibran, FZ; Rossi, LC; Banzato, BM; Corsso, JT; Pereira, GH; Motta, FS","The assessment of management effectiveness is essential to measure how well marine protected areas (MPAs) are achieving their goals and objectives. Incorporating the view of multiple stakeholders is an important component of MPA planning and management as it may simultaneously help reduce conflicts and increase adherence to rules and compliance. However, the most assessments of MPA management effectiveness is undertaken solely based on managers' perceptions. Here, we compared the perceptions of management effectiveness among managers and the management council members of three Brazilian marine reserves. Council members include stakeholders from the public and private sectors with different backgrounds. Overall, the marine reserves were classified as having medium management effectiveness, with managers perceiving higher levels of effectiveness than the council members. The main differences were related to poor communication among managers and council members and the perception of lack of participation on management decisions by council members. Assessing different perspectives on management effectiveness gives a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. Communication between managers and stakeholders is essential to guarantee that management challenges are more equally recognized. We recommend that further evaluations consider the diversity of stakeholders involved in the management to get a more realistic assessment on management effectiveness.

Can citizen science contribute to the evidence-base that underpins marine policy?,"Hyder, K; Townhill, B; Anderson, LG; Delany, J; Pinnegar, JK","Marine legislation is becoming ever more complex, so new cost-effective ways of obtaining and processing increasingly large data sets are required to support evidence-based policy making. Citizen science is one solution, but the uptake of the evidence generated by citizens among policy makers is often limited. Here, the importance of citizen science in delivery of the evidence-base that underpins marine policy was assessed using a series of case-studies. There was no consistent rationale for developing policy-relevant citizen science, but drivers included: lack of existing data, difficulty in collecting data by other means, the use of citizen science data by other organisations, and the capabilities of volunteers. Challenges to the uptake of marine citizen science were identified from policy-maker, scientist and citizen perspectives, and these related to data quality, data access, motivation of volunteers, and physical location. Citizen science has good potential to contribute to the evidence-base alongside traditional monitoring, remote sensing, and modelling, but only if outputs from citizen science projects are judged individually on quality. If this is the case, citizen science has an important role in delivery and understanding of future marine policy, but is only one part of an integrated solution.

Trade-off analysis for marine protected area management,"Brown, K; Adger, WN; Tompkins, E; Bacon, P; Shim, D; Young, K","This paper outlines an approach to natural resource management that incorporates multiple objectives for protected area management within a decision-making framework. Both regulators and other major stakeholders are directly incorporated into the approach to enhance decision-making processes. We call this approach trade-off analysis. The approach uses a framework based on multi-criteria analysis (MCA) but involves stakeholders at all stages. This holistic approach is appropriate for multiple use, complex systems such as marine protected areas (MPAs), where many different users are apparently in conflict and where linkages and feedbacks between different aspects of the ecosystem and economy exist. The paper applies trade-off analysis to the case of Buccoo Reef Marine Park (BRMP) in Tobago. Stakeholder analysis is undertaken, and social, economic and ecological criteria identified. The impacts of four different development scenarios are evaluated for these criteria. Stakeholders are asked to weight different criteria and then the outcomes of different stakeholder weightings in the MCA are used to explore different management options. For BRMP, the MCA suggests consensus around development options characterised as limited tourism development for the area surrounding the park in association with the implementation of complementary environmental management. The approach has been used to enhance stakeholder involvement in decision-making and develop consensus-based approaches to management of the MPA. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Conventional MPAs are not as effective as community co-managed areas in conserving top-down control in the Gulf of California,"Ulate, K; Alcoverro, T; Arthur, R; Aburto-Oropeza, O; Sanchez, C; Huato-Soberanis, L","While undeniably successful in protecting nearshore marine ecosystems from overfishing, conventional marine reserves often impinge on the livelihoods of dependent coastal communities. Community co-managed areas may guarantee considerably more equity, but it is unclear if they can be as effective as conventional reserves in conserving critical trophic functions. We evaluated the effectiveness of different management regimes in the Gulf of California on fish biomass and echinoderm assemblages as proxies of key ecosystem processes on rocky shores. We compared multiple sites in a mixed (multi-use areas with regulated extraction) and core (no-extraction) federally-managed areas, a military MPA (where strict patrolling ensures no extraction), a co-managed reserve where government and communities are equally responsible, and unrestricted-access areas (non MPA). Fish biomass was higher in the military reserve and the community co-managed area reserve; echinoderm numbers were very low at these locations suggesting that they were strongly controlled by top-down processes. In contrast, federally-controlled reserves were virtually no different from unrestricted-access areas in numbers or composition of fish and echinoderms. Although federal managed reserves are the most common management regime across the Gulf, our data shows that they are highly ineffective in protecting ecosystem function.

"Participatory mapping: Assessing problems and defined marine conservation planning and zoning in Jor Bay, Indonesia","Al Amin, MA; Adrianto, L; Kusumastanto, T; Imran, Z; Kurniawan, F","Jor Bay Lombok is a marine protected area (MPA) which is initiated by local communities, which have a local-driven marine management regulation called Awiq-awiq. Unfortunately, the fisheries condition has continued to decline in the past decades, where the rate of exploitation of capture fisheries in Jor Bay shows an unbalanced condition because the harvest value is still higher than the recruitments and growth. Awiq-awiq regulates all existing utilization and protection of marine resources, but yet, has not included spatial aspects, leaving a situation that leads to unsustainability for fisheries resources and other resources. Balanced zoning of ecosystems and marine resources is needed in order to ensure the sustainability of the fisheries system in Jor Bay. This paper aims to illustrate how a marine spatial planning approach in a local MPA can be built with a community-based zoning system. The integration of local systems and formal-government systems is very effective and fast in the development of MPA zoning systems by considering the optimum allocation of the existence of ecosystems that guarantee the natural metabolic processes of the fisheries system in the Bay. The implementation of the MPA zoning system is expected to be able to support the guarantee of sustainable fisheries production for the surrounding region.",2020,,"WORLD SEAFOOD CONGRESS 2019 - SEAFOOD SUPPLY CHAINS OF THE FUTURE: INNOVATION, RESPONSIBILITY, SUSTAINABILITY",414,,,WOS:000539921500001,10.1088/1755-1315/414/1/012001,,#19464,AlAmin 2020,Exclusion reason: Not a peer-reviewed article; ,
Quantitative decision support tools facilitate social-ecological alignment in community-based marine protected area design,"Krueck, NC; Abdurrahim, AY; Adhuri, DS; Mumby, PJ; Ross, H","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly used to support both biodiversity conservation and fisheries management. However, MPA performance is likely to be compromised if people who depend on fishing are excluded from MPA design decision making. Participatory MPA design helps to address this problem by engaging local stakeholders in all critical decisions, including the total coverage, placement, and local size of no-take marine reserves. Here, we report the findings from a participatory MPA design project on Selayar Island, Indonesia, in which a community initiated collaborations with scientists to access modern quantitative tools for community-led MPA scenario testing. The outcomes highlight a local disagreement between ecologically and socially desirable MPA designs. Focused on social considerations, the initial community-supported MPA design consisted of four small reserves (0.5-1 km wide) in predominately southern community waters, where they were intended to restrict external fishers. Ecologically optimal MPA designs, in contrast, consisted of one or two large reserves (4-6 km wide) in northern community waters, where they were expected to restrict primarily local fishers but better support the rebuilding of fish populations and fisheries. However, ecologically optimal MPA designs were socially infeasible. Using quantitative MPA performance assessments, the community negotiated an alternative MPA design consisting of two 1.5-2 km wide reserves at socially and ecologically favorable locations. Compared to the initial proposal, this revised MPA design was estimated (1) to protect three to four times more individuals of key fishery species within reserve boundaries and (2) to double local fishery catches. We conclude that even simple MPA design tools, which quantify and visualize local conservation and fishery outcomes under alternative MPA scenarios, add value to participatory decision making and likely MPA performance.",2019,,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,24,4,,WOS:000506574000024,10.5751/ES-11209-240406,,#19470,Krueck 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,

Social considerations for marine resource management: Evidence from Big Creek Ecological Reserve,"Pomeroy, C","Growing interest in no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) as a complement to traditional fishery management has led to increased attention to biophysical considerations for MPA design, implementation, management, and evaluation. Considerably less attention has been directed, however, toward social, cultural, and economic considerations for MPAs. information on and understanding of the relationship between MPAs and local fisheries in social, cultural, and economic, as well as biophysical, terms is especially important. At the same time, there is growing interest in collaboration between fishers and scientists to provide more complete and accurate information on fisheries and marine ecosystems. Such collaboration is one element of cooperative (or co-) management of local fisheries, which is gaining recognition as potentially more effective, appropriate, and equitable than traditional, top-down resource management. These two themes-social considerations for MPAs and co-management of local fisheries-are central to a study being conducted at central California's Big Creek Ecological Reserve. This paper provides an overview of the local skiff fishery and the cooperative arrangement at Big Creek; discusses that arrangement as a form of co-management, and as it has played an integral role in the history of the marine reserve; and concludes with observations and emerging questions about the social aspects of establishing and maintaining no-take marine reserves in the context of local fisheries.",1999,,CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS,40,,118-125,WOS:000085254300014,,,#19482,Pomeroy 1999,Exclusion reason: Not a peer-reviewed article; ,Proposed
Differences in perception of a newly created Marine Park in south-west Western Australia by boat -based recreational fishers and the broader community,"Hastings, K; Ryan, KL","Community acceptance of Marine Parks is widely acknowledged as being critical for success. Where community stewardship and voluntary compliance have been achieved, there are fewer issues with non-compliance of zoning regulations. Probability-based surveys that are representative of the wider community can improve understanding of community perceptions prior to and following establishment of Marine Parks. Understanding attitudes towards newly created Marine Parks among user groups provides valuable information for the design of education and engagement programs, while also creating a benchmark to compare changes over time. A survey of community perceptions and awareness regarding the recently created Ngari Capes Marine Park in south-west Western Australia was measured via a randomised telephone survey of local and non-local boat based recreational fishers; and local residents (including non-fishers and shore/boat fishers). This survey also evaluated other recreational uses of the park and how these activities were valued, knowledge of Marine Park zones, and how information about Marine Parks was being accessed. Participation in recreational fishing within Ngari Capes was above average and a supportive attitude towards the park was apparent. Boat-based recreational fishers displayed a higher degree of concern about fishing restrictions compared to local residents, but overall were supportive of the Marine Park. Across all user groups there was low awareness of the Ngari Capes Marine Park and poor understanding of Marine Parks.

Monitoring small-scale marine fisheries: An example from Thailand's Ko Chang archipelago,"Lunn, KE; Dearden, P","Small-scale fisheries provide food and income to millions of people worldwide, yet these fisheries are generally poorly documented and their impacts not well understood. Improved documentation of these fisheries is needed to gauge global trends, identify the threats to their sustainability, and assess management options. Combining semi-structured interviews and participant observation, this study provides baseline information about the nature and scale of small-scale fisheries in the Ko Chang archipelago, Thailand, as a first step towards instituting a monitoring and management strategy for the area. Although the area has been designated as a ""no-take"" Marine National Park, small-scale fisheries have Continued virtually unabated within the park's boundaries. Small-scale fishers living in the park are involved primarily in the shrimp trammel net, squid trap, crab trap, fish gill net, hook-and-line, and reef fish trap fisheries. Small-scale fishing boats operating out of villages on Ko Chang and Ko Maisi Yai worked for an estimated 38,000 days/year and took 330,000 kg/year of target fish and invertebrates, based on extrapolations from interviews. Observed catches of target species were, however, an average of 42-64% lower than fishers' reported catches for the fisheries in which both data collection methods could be used. Such a finding suggests that future monitoring should rely on observational techniques to assess the catches and efforts of small-scale participants. Given the area's status as a national park, regular monitoring of the small-scale fisheries should be undertaken and multiple-use zoning be considered. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Local community-based approach for sustainable management of artisanal fisheries on small islands,"de Lara, DRM; Corral, S","Socio-economic development of small island fishing communities is greatly dependent on local coastal and marine resources. Illegal fishing and aggressive practices in insular ecosystems lead to over exploitation and environmental deterioration. Moreover, a lack of scientific data increases uncertainty and prevents adequate monitoring of marine resources. This paper focuses on the integration of a local fishing community into decision-making processes with the aim to potentiate artisanal fishing on the Island of Tenerife (the Canary Islands). The aim is to preserve both the marine ecosystem and promote the socio-economic development of traditional Cofradlas (local fisher communities).A qualitative methodological framework, based on participatory problem-solution trees and focus groups, was implemented to identify the main obstacles impeding the sustainable development of the artisanal fishing sector on the island. Collective proposals with policy implications are also discussed.The community involved identified four main issues that are causing an unsustainable island fishery: 1) Overexploitation; 2) Poor self-management of Cofradlas and commercialisation problems; 3) Fisher individualism and low co-management strategies, and 4) Illegal fishing increase vs. artisanal fishing decline. Results show the required policy enhancements to tackle those issues with, for instance, the creation of marine protected areas, the promotion of a common islander vision, and an increase in participatory research projects between scientists and fishers. Participants also revealed the necessity to adapt existing regulations to local specificity to reduce the gap between policy makers and local community. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Struggles for inclusive development in small-scale fisheries in Paraty, Southeastern Coast of Brazil","de Araujo, LG; de Castro, F; de Freitas, RR; Vieira, MARD; Seixas, CS","This article discusses challenges in fostering participation of marginalized actors in coastal fisheries governance in Brazil. Recent changes in the institutional architecture of fisheries governance have opened new spaces for the participation of small-scale fishers to influence setting of the policy agenda, management practices, and monitoring strategies. However, the participation of local users has been opposed by conservationist policies, which limit their access to fishing grounds. Small-scale fishers' involvement has been characterized by tensions between participatory spaces provided within bureaucratic structures and claimed participatory spaces built from below. This article analyzes fisheries governance in the municipality of Paraty, Southeastern Coast of Brazil, with a focus on three institutional innovations implemented by the government to promote social participation - Fishing Accords, Terms of Agreement, and Management Councils of Protected Areas. Although these innovations are important for the recognition of small-scale fisheries as compatible with conservation policies, problems such as low institutional capacity, power imbalance, limits of decentralized governance, and lack of long-term financial resources remain as challenges for the consolidation of an inclusive development model for coastal fisheries in Brazil.

Incorporating Effectiveness of Community-Based Management in a National Marine Gap Analysis for Fiji,"Mills, M; Jupiter, SD; Pressey, RL; Ban, NC; Comley, J","Every action in a conservation plan has a different level of effect and consequently contributes differentially to conservation. We examined how several community-based, marine, management actions differed in their contribution to national-level conservation goals in Fiji. We held a workshop with experts on local fauna and flora and local marine management actions to translate conservation goals developed by the national government into ecosystem-specific quantitative objectives and to estimate the relative effectiveness of Fiji's community-based management actions in achieving these objectives. The national conservation objectives were to effectively manage 30% of the nation's fringing reefs, nonfringing reefs, mangroves, and intertidal ecosystems (30% objective) and 10% of other benthic ecosystems (10% objective). The experts evaluated the contribution of the various management actions toward national objectives. Scores ranged from 0 (ineffective) to 1 (maximum effectiveness) and included the following management actions: permanent closures (i.e., all extractive use of resources prohibited indefinitely) (score of 1); conditional closures harvested once per year or less as dictated by a management plan (0.500.95); conditional closures harvested without predetermined frequency or duration (0.100.85); other management actions, such as regulations on gear and species harvested (0.150.50). Through 3 gap analyses, we assessed whether the conservation objectives in Fiji had been achieved. Each analysis was based on a different assumption: (1) all parts of locally managed marine areas (including closures and other management) conserve species and ecosystems effectively; (2) closures conserve species and ecosystems, whereas areas outside closures, open to varying levels of resource extraction, do not; and (3) actions that allow different levels of resource extraction vary in their ability to conserve species and ecosystems. Under assumption 1, Fiji's national conservation objectives were exceeded in all marine ecosystems; under assumption 2, none of Fiji's conservation objectives were met; and under assumption 3, on the basis of the scores assigned by experts, Fiji achieved the 10% but not the 30% objectives for ecosystems. Understanding the relative contribution of management actions to achieving conservation objectives is critical in the assessment of conservation achievements at the national level, where multiple management actions will be needed to achieve national conservation objectives.",2011,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,25,6,1155-1164,WOS:000296962700024,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01749.x,,#19543,Mills 2011,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,

We evaluate the benefits of the CES provided by 151 UK marine sites to recreational sea anglers and divers, using subjective well-being indicators. Factor analysis of an online questionnaire with 1220 participants revealed multiple CES benefits that contribute to human wellbeing e.g. including 'engagement with nature', 'place identity' and 'therapeutic value'. In addition to regional differences, we also found that biophysical attributes of sites, such as the presence of charismatic species and species diversity, were positively associated with provision of CES benefits. The study provides evidence that could be used to inform designation of protected areas.

The contemporary economic value of elasmobranchs in The Bahamas: Reaping the rewards of 25 years of stewardship and conservation,"Haas, AR; Fedler, T; Brooks, EJ","Elasmobranch populations in The Bahamas offer a unique juxtaposition to the widespread decline of many species around the world, largely due to management and conservation initiatives implemented over the last 25 years. Several industries have been built around the diverse and abundant elasmobranch assemblages found in The Bahanias, however a comprehensive assessment of the non-consumptive economic value of this resource has yet to be undertaken. In this study, we identified various sectors that benefit from elasmobranch populations in The Bahamas, which included tourism, film and television and research. We incorporated data from operator and participant surveys, government sources and information available on the Internet to calculate the economic value and location of these various sectors. This study establishes The Bahamas dive industry as the largest in the world, contributing approximately $113.8 million USD annually to the Bahamian economy in direct and value added expenditures. Elasmobranch tourism generated 99% of the total revenue, and the balance generated by film and television and research. The relative economic importance of shark diving was greater in economically disadvantaged out-islands where specific charismatic species are sought. This was also in locations where a large proportion of the revenue generated by those activities does not enter the Bahamian economy. The sustained national stewardship demonstrated by the Bahamian government will ensure that this important economic resource continues to be productive, but also highlights the need for regional Caribbean-wide commitment to the management of highly migratory species that are important to many economically depressed areas of The Bahamas.

Fisher participation in monitoring: Does it help reduce excessive investment in fishing capacity?,"Quynh, CNT; Hailu, A; Schilizzi, S; Iftekhar, S","The problem of excess capacity has persisted in many fisheries worldwide, threatening the sustainability of fisheries, even in cases where there are regulatory restrictions on fishing inputs. Getting fishers involved in monitoring illegal fishing has been one of the solutions proposed to tackle excessive investment in fishing capacity. However, the real effects of participation in monitoring have not yet been investigated in a rigorous and quantitative way. Using survey data for small-scale fisheries under a Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries (TURFs) system in Vietnam, this study measures the extent of excess capacity at individual fisher level using a bootstrapped Data Envelopment Analysis and investigates the effects of fisher participation in monitoring on level of excess capacity by employing an Endogenous Switching Regression model. We find evidence of substantial excess capacity even under TURFs, with fishers on average operating at 59% capacity. However, the results also show that participation in monitoring contributes to a significant reduction in excess capacity. Non-monitors are likely to have short-sighted investment behavior while monitors are likely to be driven by perception about the management of TURFs, and long-term incentives in their investment behavior. Age, education, and alternative livelihood also help explain the variation in the level of excess capacity among fishers. Knowledge of the drivers of fisher investment are of critical importance to policy-makers to establish effective capacity management interventions. Engaging fishers in monitoring should be considered as one of the key strategies for reducing excess capacity. To promote fisher participation in monitoring, effort should be directed towards enhancing awareness of the consequences of illegal fishing and building fisher trust in peers and local government officials.",2018,,FISHERIES RESEARCH,206,,138-149,WOS:000438005100014,10.1016/j.fishres.2018.04.024,,#19576,Quynh 2018,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Crossing Science-Policy-Societal Boundaries to Reduce Scientific and Institutional Uncertainty in Small-Scale Fisheries,"Sutton, AM; Rudd, MA","The governance of small-scale fisheries (SSF) is challenging due to the uncertainty, complexity, and interconnectedness of social, political, ecological, and economical processes. Conventional SSF management has focused on a centralized and top-down approach. A major criticism of conventional management is the over-reliance on 'expert science' to guide decision-making and poor consideration of fishers' contextually rich knowledge. That is thought to exacerbate the already low governance potential of SSF. Integrating scientific knowledge with fishers' knowledge is increasingly popular and is often assumed to help reduce levels of biophysical and institutional uncertainties. Many projects aimed at encouraging knowledge integration have, however, been unsuccessful. Our objective in this research was to assess factors that influence knowledge integration and the uptake of integrated knowledge into policy-making. We report results from 54 semi-structured interviews with SSF researchers and practitioners from around the globe. Our analysis is framed in terms of scientific credibility, societal legitimacy, and policy saliency, and we discuss cases that have been partially or fully successful in reducing uncertainty via push-and-pull-oriented boundary crossing initiatives. Our findings suggest that two important factors affect the science-policy-societal boundary: a lack of consensus among stakeholders about what constitutes credible knowledge and institutional uncertainty resulting from shifting policies and leadership change. A lack of training for scientific leaders and an apparent 'shelf-life' for community organizations highlight the importance of ongoing institutional support for knowledge integration projects.

Timor-Leste is a politically young country in the relatively rare position of having underexploited fisheries in some areas that can be leveraged to improve coastal livelihood outcomes and food and nutrition security. The collaborative and decentralized characteristics of co-management appeal to policymakers in Timor-Leste with provisions for co-management and customary laws applied to resource use were incorporated into state law in 2004 and again reinforced in 2012 revisions. The first fisheries co-management pilots have commenced where management arrangements have been codified through tara bandu, a process of setting local laws built around ritual practice that prohibits nominated activities under threat of spiritual and material sanctions. To date, however, there has been little critical evaluation of the suitability or potential effectiveness of co-management or tara bandu in the Timor-Leste fisheries context. To address this gap, we adapted the interactive governance framework to review the ecological, social and governance characteristics of Timor-Leste's fisheries to explore whether co-management offers a valid and viable resource governance model. We present two co-management case studies and examine how they were established, who was involved, the local institutional structures, and the fisheries governance challenges they sought to address. Despite their relative proximity, the two sites contrasted in local ecology and fishery type; community institutions were starkly different but equally strong; and one site had tangible economic benefits to justify compliance, where the other had marginal and anecdotal fishery gains. In our review of the broader governance landscape in Timor-Leste, we see co-management as a useful mechanism to govern small-scale fisheries, but there is a need to connect legitimized local institutions with hierarchical governance of higher and external influences. Initial successes with implementing tara bandu incorporating a small marine closure have stimulated other communities to implement no-take zones - one universally popular but very limited interpretation of co-management. However, we highlight the need for a set of guiding principles to ensure legitimate community engagement, and avoid external appropriation that may reinforce marginalization of certain user groups or customary power hierarchies.",2019,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,6,,,WOS:000475393500001,10.3389/fmars.2019.00392,,#19630,Tilley 2019,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,

Hierarchical toolbox: Ensuring scientific accuracy of citizen science for tropical coastal ecosystems,"Vermeiren, P; Munoz, C; Zimmer, M; Sheaves, M","Increased human population growth threatens the ecological functioning and goods and services provided by tropical coastal ecosystems. However, a lack of scientific baselines and resources hamper efforts to develop and monitor ecological indicators of environmental change. Citizen science can provide a cost and time effective solution, but needs considerable context specific development to ensure it provides valid information of the quality level required for acceptance by the scientific community. We reviewed the use of sampling methods for shore crabs as an example of an abundant tropical coastal organism with high citizen science suitability and ecological indicator capacity. We propose a hierarchical toolbox based on the distinction between rapid methods, allowing fast, noninvasive sampling by independent citizens, and medium speed methods allowing detailed but more invasive sampling requiring trained citizens working in close interaction with professionals. The hierarchical structure enables full use of the large scale data collection ability of citizen scientists at lower levels, while ensuring validation of errors at higher levels. Additionally, at each level, bias reduction and data validation measures can be employed. We conclude that citizen science methodologies can provide accurate large scale data to develop the ecological baselines urgently needed to monitor and manage environmental change in many tropical coastal ecosystems. We discuss a stepwise implementation of the toolbox leading to accuracy metadata which can be independently reviewed as an ultimate accuracy assessment and data integration mechanism among multiple projects.

A global assessment of the relationship between anthropogenic debris on land and the seafloor,"Roman, L; Hardesty, BD; Leonard, GH; Pragnell-Raasch, H; Mallos, N; Campbell, I; Wilcox, C","Pollution of coastal and marine environments by mismanaged anthropogenic debris is a global threat requiring complex, multilateral solutions and mitigation strategies. International efforts to catalogue and quantify the density, extent and nature of mismanaged waste have not yet assessed the heterogeneity of debris between nearby areas. Better understanding of how debris types and density can be used as a proxy between regions and between land and seafloor habitats at a global scale can aid in developing cost effective and representative debris monitoring systems. Using volunteer collected clean-up and survey data, we compared the proportion and density of both total debris and specific items across 19,428 coastal land and seafloor sites from International Coastal Cleanups and Dive Against Debris surveys, from 86 countries between 2011 and 2018. We show that although some items common on land are also common on the seafloor, there is an overall global mismatch between debris types and densities on land and the seafloor from nearby areas. Correlations in land/seafloor debris type/density occurred primarily for items which entangle and/or sink, including fishing line, plastic bags, glass and poly-ethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. Minimal similarity between land and seafloor surveys occurs for items which float or degrade. We suggest that to accurately evaluate local debris density, land and seafloor surveys are required to gain a holistic understanding. When detailed information on debris type, relative concentration, and likely source and transport are assessed, more cost effective and efficient policy interventions can be designed and implemented from local through to global scales.

Ferries and Environmental DNA: Underway Sampling From Commercial Vessels Provides New Opportunities for Systematic Genetic Surveys of Marine Biodiversity,"Valsecchi, E; Arcangeli, A; Lombardi, R; Boyse, E; Carr, IM; Galli, P; Goodman, SJ","Marine environmental DNA (eDNA) is an important tool for biodiversity research and monitoring but challenges remain in scaling surveys over large spatial areas, and increasing the frequency of sampling in remote locations at reasonable cost. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of sampling from commercial vessels (Mediterranean ferries) while underway, as a strategy to facilitate replicable, systematic marine eDNA surveys in locations that would normally be challenging and expensive for researchers to access. Sixteen eDNA samples were collected from four fixed sampling stations, and in response to four cetacean sightings, across three cruises undertaken along the 300 km ferry route between Livorno (Tuscany) and Golfo Aranci (Sardinia) in the Ligurian/Tyrrhenian Seas, June-July 2018. Using 12SrDNA and 16SrDNA metabarcoding markers, we recovered diverse marine vertebrate Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) from teleost fish, elasmobranchs, and cetaceans. We detected sample heterogeneity consistent with previously known variation in species occurrences, including putative species spawning peaks associated with specific sea surface temperature ranges, and increased night time abundance of bathypelagic species known to undertake diel migrations through the water column. We suggest commercial vessel based marine eDNA sampling using the global shipping network has potential to facilitate broad-scale biodiversity monitoring in the world's oceans.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000697816700001,10.3389/fmars.2021.704786,,#19670,Valsecchi 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Incorporating ecosystem considerations into fisheries management: Large-scale industry perspectives,"Bodal, BO","Internationally, the large-scale industry is a diverse group of both shore-based and at-sea harvesting and processing operations. As with all elements of the fishing industry, the performance of large-scale fisheries is controlled by various degrees of governmental and institutional constraints. The record shows that the degree of responsible fisheries practised in any sector of the fishing industry largely depends upon the level of responsibility within government and regulatory institutions, and a commitment to responsible fisheries by the fishing industry.There are a number of reasons why some fisheries have attracted larger vessels, such as remote fishing grounds, the large size of the resource, the perishable nature of the fish, the need for capital-intensive production equipment and the harsh and dangerous fishing conditions. In this production environment, only large-scale fisheries are able to deliver seafood at cost-effective prices. Without the economies of scale of the large-scale seafood industry, this healthy source of protein would either be left in the water or be affordable only to the wealthy.Greenpeace and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have repeatedly attacked the large-scale sector as unsustainable and of 'strip mining' the seas. However, in the North Pacific under USA jurisdiction, the facts dispute this notion. Fisheries in this region are widely regarded as some of the most responsibly and conservatively managed fisheries anywhere in the world. With a track record of nearly 30 years of commercial fishing activities, none of the 63 species of groundfish in the USA North Pacific are classified as overfished or even approaching the overfishing level. Bering Sea pollock, the largest fishery in the USA, currently is at a high biomass level, 10 million t. The allowable harvest rate of Bering Sea pollock in 2001 is well below the acceptable biological catch of 1.85 million t, and about half of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) harvest rate.The primary reason that these fisheries are healthy and sustainable is due to the responsible application of the precautionary approach in the calculation of quotas and in the overall management of the fishery since the inception of the 200 mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the late 1970s. In addition to precautionary levels of allowable catch, harvests are monitored closely and reported on an ongoing basis. In the Alaskan pollock and Pacific whiting fisheries, the large-scale fleets are required to have two federal fishery observers aboard at all times, who collect fishery data on 99% of all hauls. One hundred percent of all fish caught are weighed on flow scales, and catch data is reported daily to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the agency responsible for in-season monitoring of the fishery. Both regulatory and voluntary by-catch controls are important tools that have been employed for over 20 years. The large-scale fleet in the North Pacific has the ability to respond rapidly to changes in by-catch and is able to relocate to areas of lower by-catch. This is demonstrated by an overall by-catch rate of 0.6% in the pollock fishery, the lowest of the world's major fisheries.Management in the USA North Pacific has implemented marine protected areas to protect habitat. In an effort to protect fish and crab habitat in the eastern Bering Sea, areas closed to bottom trawling encompass 30,000 square miles, or about 25% of the available fishing area. Other ecosystem principles employed include prohibitions on fishing for forage fish stocks in the North Pacific, to protect these important prey species for seabirds and marine mammals. Further, NMFS conducts research on and manages not only targeted fish stocks but also non-targeted species of fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, and takes into consideration the inter-relationships between these species and the physical and chemical forces of the marine environment.The large-scale fleets in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska have been supportive of conservative ecosystem-based management. They are all aware that their economic viability is dependent on sustainable resources, and hence they share a long-term commitment to healthy resources.Recent changes in USA law have allowed the large-scale sector to pursue new avenues, such as harvesting cooperatives, in which quotas are assigned to vessels, thus ending the race for fish. In an era when most fisheries throughout the world are heavily overcapitalized, managing harvesting effort with Olympic-style quotas, where vessels must compete against each other as frantically as possible, waste and inefficiency are all too common. In certain fisheries, harvesting cooperatives have proven to be far superior to Olympic quotas as a management tool. Cooperatives have led to reductions in by-catch, while at the same time providing increased recovery of processed seafood product: an impressive 36% increase in the pollock fishery. Harvesting cooperatives also result in spreading catch effort more evenly over space and time, decreasing the potential for localized depletion of resources. Because cooperatives allow for individual accountability, and hence a meaningful role in managing the resource, their members are willing to support, both logistically and financially, scientific research to improve resource assessments, increased monitoring and testing of innovative fishing practices. For instance, the Pollock Conservation Cooperative contributes US$1.4 million annually to fisheries research.In the USA North Pacific, the large-scale fishing industry, and American Seafoods, are very supportive of good scientific information and understand that sustainable fisheries, such as the eastern Bering Sea pollock fishery, are only possible with good data on stock status and fishery removals. Integrating additional ecosystem data into existing fishery management plans is an ongoing process and will require careful and comprehensive analysis. However, in many parts of the world, this is already being done, and these efforts should continue as long as clear, measurable benefits to the environment and stakeholders can be demonstrated. With the right incentives, the fishing industry can provide positive, creative energy for responsible management practices and fishery research.",2003,,RESPONSIBLE FISHERIES IN THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM,,,41-46,WOS:000227034800003,10.1079/9780851996332.0041,,#19679,Bodal 2003,Exclusion reason: Not a peer-reviewed article; ,
Angling management organizations: integrating the recreational sector into fishery management,"Sutinen, JG; Johnston, RJ","This paper examines ways to reduce conflicts and improve the sustainability and value of marine recreational fisheries by fully integrating the recreational sector into the management of fisheries. One possibility involves a novel approach, here called angling management organizations (AMOs), which combines three of the more pervasive and promising trends in fishery management worldwide-management devolution, strengthened harvest rights, and co-management. AMOs are community-based organizations that are designed to conform to seven basic principles of integrated fishery management, which are described below. AMOs are loosely related to rights-based producer organizations in commercial fisheries, and are expected to strengthen resource stewardship, reduce enforcement and monitoring costs, alleviate management conflicts, and produce greater long-term net economic benefits in recreational fisheries. The other organizational structures considered here, including the management status quo, do not conform to all seven principles and are not expected to be as effective as AMOs.

The structured household survey and semi-structured interviews were conducted along with field observation during December 2018. The descriptive analysis applied to understand community knowledge, acceptance, participation, and perception on the current of marine environmental conditions, while the Analytic Network Process (ANP) used to identify problems and best strategies to improve future actions. Community knowledge and participation in MAR programs are at a moderate level, while community acceptance of MAR programs is at a high level. They mostly responded that the coastal environment is in better condition compared to previous years. Overall, the level of community perception in Batu Belah about the MAR program is in the moderate level category.

Knowledge exchange as a tool for transboundary and coastal management of the Arafura and Timor Seas,"Stacey, N; Karam, J; Jackson, M; Kennett, R; Wagey, T","The exchange of knowledge, skills and experience can improve management in transboundary regions through improved understanding of issues, development of partnerships, and acquisition of new skills amongst regional groups and stakeholders. A structured knowledge exchange in the form of a week-long study tour was piloted involving representatives of coastal communities from Indonesia and Timor-Leste travelling to the Northern Territory in Australia. The exchange was conducted as part of the Arafura Timor Seas Ecosystem Action Program and facilitated by two Australian organisations. The tour involved a series of activities, workshop sessions and field visits with a range of government, non-government and Indigenous (Australian) organisations to generate ideas, innovations, partnerships and shared understanding of community-based marine and coastal management and livelihoods between the three countries. The development, design, implementation and evaluation results of the study tour are evaluated. The results show that participants gained broad capacity benefits in four areas: raised awareness about different community and co-management approaches to marine conservation and management and livelihoods improvement, enhanced knowledge of tools for implementation of marine conservation and management, improved consensus and teamwork amongst participants, and increased potential for developing networks among the three countries. The results also highlight areas for potential improvement in study tour preparation, format and capacity outcomes that provide valuable lessons for others looking to embark on similar knowledge exchange activities.

Preliminary study of the sea surface temperature (SST) at fishing ground locations based on the net deployment of traditional purse-seine boats in the northern waters of Aceh - A community-based data collection approach,"Haridhi, HA; Nanda, M; Wilson, CR; Rizal, S","Reconstruction projects after the Indian Ocean Tsunami of December 26, 2004 were typically contracted out to implementing partners or government agencies. One of the few projects directly implemented by the Body of Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (BRR) was funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help reestablish fisheries. During the course of the project, 151 GPS-enabled depth sounders with data-logging devices were installed on various types of artisanal fishing boats engaged in the different types of fishing strategies in Aceh such as purse-seine, drop-line, long-line, and gill net fishing. These devices were configured to automatically record time, position, speed, water depth, and sea surface temperature (SST) every time the boat moved 30 m. This study examines the relationship between the sea surface temperature (SST) and the net deployment (ND) of traditional purse seine fishers. The data consists of 922 data sets (6,170,648 data points) collected from 45 purse seine boats between June 2007 and May 2009. Among the data, 1,619 data points indicated the total number of ND; the nets were deployed only when schools of fish were actually sighted. The results indicate that the most frequent SST for ND is 28-28.5 degrees C +/- 0.1365 degrees C with a mean standard error of 0.0117% in a 95% confidence interval. This study has demonstrated that the data gathered from the fishermen (community-based approach) has near-real-time character and, consequently, is an important source for the monitoring and managing of the local fish stocks.

Traditional community-based coastal marine fisheries management in Viet Nam,"Ruddle, K","Despite more than a century of colonial occupation, radical political and administrative change, and more recent motorization of fleets and gear introductions, there remains in Viet Nam a still functioning tradition of local stakeholder organizations (van chai) by which marine fishing communities historically regulated the fishery and ensured mutual assistance for their membership. Such systems remain strong in many coastal communities, especially in the Central and Southern regions, largely because their moral authority and leadership is deeply rooted in and legitimated by traditional religion, expressed in the community ""whale"" shrine. In 1963, one such community organization, in Binh Thuan Province of the Central Region, comprehensively documented its traditional regulations to inform future generations. That document is analyzed here, and supplemented and complemented by information from seven other marine fisheries van chai in the Central and Southern regions. A brief historical introduction and a description of the official fisheries management systems are followed by an analysis of the structure of the traditional community-based system, in terms of authority, rights, rules, monitoring, accountability conflict resolution, and sanctions. Since in many localities substantial and fundamental aspects of the traditional van chai system continue to function, it is concluded that these traditional systems, suitably adapted to modern conditions, could enhance fisheries management at the lowest administrative levels in Viet Nam.

Solomon Islands Largest Hawksbill Turtle Rookery Shows Signs of Recovery after 150 Years of Excessive Exploitation,"Hamilton, RJ; Bird, T; Gereniu, C; Pita, J; Ramohia, PC; Walter, R; Goerlich, C; Limpus, C","The largest rookery for hawksbill turtles in the oceanic South Pacific is the Arnavon Islands, which are located in the Manning Strait between Isabel and Choiseul Province, Solomon Islands. The history of this rookery is one of overexploitation, conflict and violence. Throughout the 1800s Roviana headhunters from New Georgia repeatedly raided the Manning Strait to collect hawksbill shell which they traded with European whalers. By the 1970s the Arnavons hawksbill population was in severe decline and the national government intervened, declaring the Arnavons a sanctuary in 1976. But this government led initiative was short lived, with traditional owners burning down the government infrastructure and resuming intensive harvesting in 1982. In 1991 routine beach monitoring and turtle tagging commenced at the Arnavons along with extensive community consultations regarding the islands' future, and in 1995 the Arnavon Community Marine Conservation Area (ACMCA) was established. Around the same time national legislation banning the sale of all turtle products was passed. This paper represents the first analysis of data from 4536 beach surveys and 845 individual turtle tagging histories obtained from the Arnavons between 1991-2012. Our results and the results of others, reveal that many of the hawksbill turtles that nest at the ACMCA forage in distant Australian waters, and that nesting on the Arnavons occurs throughout the year with peak nesting activity coinciding with the austral winter. Our results also provide the first known evidence of recovery for a western pacific hawksbill rookery, with the number of nests laid at the ACMCA and the remigration rates of turtles doubling since the establishment of the ACMCA in 1995. The Arnavons case study provides an example of how changes in policy, inclusive community-based management and long term commitment can turn the tide for one of the most charismatic and endangered species on our planet.",2015,,PLOS ONE,10,4,,WOS:000352478400039,10.1371/journal.pone.0121435,,#19746,Hamilton 2015,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Acanthaster planci invasions: applying biosecurity practices to manage a native boom and bust coral pest in Australia,"Hoey, J; Campbell, ML; Hewitt, CL; Gould, B; Bird, R","Coral reef systems are in global decline. In Australia, much of this decline has been attributable to cyclic outbreaks (every similar to 17 years) of the coral-feeding crown-of-thorns seastar. While a native species, when in large enough densities the seastar acts like an invasive pest. Since 2012 the Australian government has invested significantly in a targeted control program using lethal injection. While this program is effective for individual reefs, it is not a complete strategy for the entire Great Barrier Reef (similar to 2,500 reefs). In order to find a longer-term solution to the problem, in 2015, the lead author travelled to New Zealand, the United States, and Canada under a Churchill Fellowship to understand successful aquatic integrated pest management strategies and their potential application to the Great Barrier Reef. Meetings and workshops were convened with experts who specialise in risk assessment, categorisation, and management of aquatic invasive species. The experts comprised academics, applied scientists, policy makers, and a not for profit community based invasive species council. Bioinvasion management and prioritisation of management effort using risk-based frameworks were reviewed for application to the crown-of-thorns seastar. This viewpoint is novel in its approach of applying invasive species tools and perspectives to a non-invasive, native marine pest. Early detection and rapid response is key to preventing the transition of the seastar from natural densities to outbreak densities. However given the seastar is a native species already established, when in outbreak mode a multifaceted post-border management approach is essential. Private support funding models, that bridge conservation and tourism/philanthropy have proved successful in New Zealand to supplement government funded marine reserve management - this is an approach which should be explored by Australia to help manage the seastar. Dedicated support and commitment is needed to break the issue-attention cycle. On the Great Barrier Reef, a dedicated biosecurity approach should be used to maintain the seastar at natural densities, increase the time between outbreaks, protect coral cover and increase resilience of the system.",2016,,MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,7,3,213-220,WOS:000422637100001,10.3391/mbi.2016.7.3.01,,#19772,Hoey 2016,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
"Spatial analysis for site selection in marine aquaculture: An ecosystem approach applied to Baia Sul, Santa Catarina, Brazil","Vianna, LFD; Bonetti, J","The aim of this research was to propose and evaluate a methodological approach to integration and spatial data analysis in order to generate information towards a participatory site selection for bivalve marine aquaculture in the Baia Sul, Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. For this purpose, the Baia Sul was investigated considering an ecosystem approach for aquaculture leading to an assessment of its potential for marine aquaculture. The planning of the aquaculture parks was made through a participatory process to incorporate both environmental carrying capacity and social carrying capacity. Experts and modellers developed a GIS model to assess the potential for marine aquaculture in Baia Sul. Continuous (unclassified) maps were used to provide spatial information about the variation of the potential for marine aquaculture in the Baia Sul. The maps were used to plan 53 aquaculture parks over the Baia Sul. The site selection of the parks was made in six public hearings attended by 403 stakeholders from 38 institutions representing different sectors with diverse interests in coastal zone. The results showed that although the Baia Sul is suitable for the growth of bivalve molluscs, some hydrodynamic characteristics and the influence of urbanization constitute a sanitary risk for the activity. Experts, modellers and stakeholders had a different perception about the importance of criteria in the aquaculture parks site selection. While the experts and modellers considered the environmental criteria as the most important aspect to locate the aquaculture parks, the stakeholders took into account mainly the logistics. The final result of the aquaculture parks location, approved by the Brazilian Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture (MPA), adopted the site selection by the stakeholders, providing aquaculture parks in areas with sanitary risk for the bivalve cultivation. The main advantage of the adopted assessment strategy was to identify the divergence between experts, modellers and the stakeholders and the distance that still exist between scientist and decision makers in Brazil.Statement of relevance: This is the first article about a participatory GIS for aquaculture in Brazil. The method was developed to be according to Ecological Approach to Aquaculture.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative survey methods used for the monitoring of marine recreational fishing in France,"Bellanger, M; Levrel, H","The growth of marine recreational activities raises the issues of the current lack of knowledge on these activities and the information required to assess their potential impacts. Indeed, the monitoring of unrecorded activities is a great challenge, especially when basic information, such as the size of the population practicing the different activities, is unknown. In this paper, the experience of the monitoring of marine recreational fishing was used to carry out a diagnosis study to assess the cost-effectiveness of survey methods used in France between 2004 and 2012. Costs of alternative surveys were balanced with data quality, and particular attention was paid to potential biases. Results showed that the involvement of citizens through diary surveys could be a cost-effective option when the recruitment of participants complied with randomness and representativeness requirements.

ESTIMATES OF TOTAL LANDINGS: SAMPLING DESIGN FOR ARTISANAL FISHERIES,"Alves, DC; de Moura, RL; Minte-Vera, CV","Estimating total landings of artisanal fisheries in managed areas is essential for the development of programs aimed at the establishment of sustainable production systems. However, few experiences addressed the constraints of assessments targeted at multispecific and small scale fisheries with pulverized landings. Total annual production (fish, lobsters and octopus) at the Marine Extractive Reserve of Corumbau, Bahia, Brazil, in 2006, was estimated through yields recorded by fisherfolks, in the scope of a participatory fisheries monitoring program. Three designs were employed: 1) simple random sampling, 2) stratified random sampling by month and fishing frequency, 3) stratified random sampling by community, fishing frequency and months, resulting in estimates of 349t (95% confidence interval = 305-393), 330t (289-372) and 315t (279-351), respectively. This kind of information can help design strategies for aggregation of value to small scale fisheries production, and also for the dimensioning of the corresponding infrastructure.

The Canadian Arctic and the Oceans Act: the development of participatory environmental research and management,"Berkes, F; Mathias, J; Kislalioglu, M; Fast, H","In recent years in the Canadian Arctic, participatory and pluralistic approaches have become common in several areas of environmental management relevant to the resolution of multiple-use conflicts: fish and wildlife, protected area planning, integrated coastal zone management, ecosystem health monitoring, contaminants research, environmental assessment, and climate change. This paper analyzes the emergence and development of aboriginal participation in resource management in each of these areas, with emphasis on the Canada Oceans Act. Policy change seems to parallel the emergence of aboriginal land claims and the general political movement towards greater self-government. Increasing political power of northern populations in general, and aboriginal groups in particular, have led to a modification of the environmental decision-making process, and to the incorporation of local values, priorities, and traditional environmental knowledge in environmental research and management. Especially important in this process has been the emergence of traditional environmental knowledge as a mechanism by which participatory approaches can be implemented. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Cooperative management of the state's Marine Ecological Reserves: Preliminary evidence from Big Creek,"Pomeroy, C; Beck, J","The passage of Proposition 132 in 1990 banned the use of gillnets in California's nearshore areas, and mandated the establishment of four Marine Ecological Reserves (MERs) along the state's coast. To determine the MERs' effectiveness in protecting and enhancing fishery resources their stated goal - it is essential to allocate resources and develop mechanisms for monitoring them over time. This, however, requires financial and personnel resources that may or may not be readily available from the state. An alternative or complement lies in the possibility of involving local fishermen in the collection of data and other, related management tasks. Big Creek Ecological Reserve, is unique among the four MERs in that such a system of cooperative management had emerged well before its formal establishment. Since 1991, the manager of the adjacent terrestrial reserve and local fishermen have mapped and systematically collected data on rockfish catches at sites near the marine reserve in an attempt to monitor the effects of local fishing on the MER and vice verse. We explore the Big Creek arrangement, its history and evolution, as well as current efforts to refine and enhance the system so that it may better serve research and management needs. We discuss the cooperative arrangement in connection with its benefits for both local fishers and managers including 1) the provision of low cost, high quality fishery-dependent data to complement fishery-independent data for the evaluation of the relationship between the MER and local fisheries, and 2) the maintenance of ongoing communication among local fishermen, researchers and managers. Taken together, these elements may enhance the effectiveness of the MER.",1998,,"CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD OCEAN '97 - TAKING A LOOK AT CALIFORNIA'S OCEAN RESOURCES: AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE, VOLS 1 AND 2, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS",,,105-116,WOS:000075224700015,,,#20017,Pomeroy 1998,Exclusion reason: Not a peer-reviewed article; ,missing
Meaningful marine monitoring: the three R's to Responsible Stewardship,"Roletto, J; Howard, D; Brown, C","Research and Responsible Stewardship result in Resource Protection and are the basis of the management program for the Gulf of the Farallones (GFNMS), Cordell Bank (CBNMS) and the northern portion (Ano Nuevo to Rocky Point) of Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuaries (MBNMS), which are administered through the Sanctuary office, in San Francisco. Through the use of volunteers (citizen scientists) the Sanctuary directly educates hundreds of local constituents on marine resources and indirectly reaches 1000's of visitors to the Sanctuary each year. The volunteers collect data that will be used to protect the natural resources of the Sanctuary while they learn how to be responsible stewards of the Sanctuary. Through the use of volunteer monitors we can accomplish our research objectives: 1) to assess the gaps in the Sanctuary's information base that may affect our ability to manage the area; 2) conduct studies of species or marine communities to identify resources most at risk or in need of management attention; 3) promote the Sanctuaries as a site for management related marine research by providing financial and logistical support for scientific investigations that address critical marine resource protection issues; 4) design research projects that are responsive to management concerns and that contribute to improved management of the Sanctuary; 5) make effective use of research results by incorporating them into interpretive and resource protection programs; and 6) encourage information exchange and cooperation among all the organizations and agencies undertaking management related research in the Sanctuaries to promote more timely and informed management.",1998,,"CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD OCEAN '97 - TAKING A LOOK AT CALIFORNIA'S OCEAN RESOURCES: AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE, VOLS 1 AND 2, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS",,,1338-1347,WOS:000075224700170,,,#20018,Roletto 1998,Exclusion reason: Not a peer-reviewed article; ,missing

The use of sociocultural valuation in sustainable environmental management,"Ruiz-Frau, A; Krause, T; Marba, N","The integration of sociocultural valuations (SCV) within an ecosystem services (ES) framework is increasingly being required in environmental management contexts. Yet, this raises important questions: how do we approach SCV when people's perceptions are based on unbalanced information and advocate for detrimental actions? How then should SCV results be used? Should they be used to steer decisions? We use an example from a SCV of ES provided by seagrass meadows in the North Western Mediterranean to provide recommendations on SCV integration into the management of a coastal ecosystem. Our results show that societal perceptions and preferences for specific management actions are generally built on unbalanced and incomplete knowledge. Consequently, establishing management decisions on SCV could lead to detrimental outcomes, potentially undermining long-term environmental and social benefits. We highlight the importance of integrating SCV into management design to tailor management to specific contexts. However, we also show that SCV should be considered carefully when deciding on management actions and that the integration of SCV outcomes has to be assessed with regards to the level of knowledge among society.

Angler travel distances: Implications for spatial approaches to marine recreational fisheries governance,"Camp, EV; Ahrens, RNM; Crandall, C; Lorenzen, K","Increasingly recreational fisheries are being managed as socioecological systems using spatially explicit and participatory place based approaches. Such approaches require considering the spatial dynamics of a resource (fish) as well as its users (anglers). While the former is comparatively well studied, very little empirical information exists regarding the spatial ranges of angler travel to fishing locations. To address this and ultimately inform spatial and place based management approaches, the statistical properties of angler travel were assessed in six popular marine recreational fisheries in Florida, USA. Expected angler travel distances differed among species, regions, and years, with most trips in certain fisheries (e.g., common snook) made by anglers residing in close proximity to the fishing site (< 30 km), while anglers targeting other species (e.g., red snapper) usually traveled more than 200 km from their residence to fish. In concert with literature, these results suggest that some fisheries may be better suited than others for more spatially explicit or place based approaches to management. More broadly, these results can be used to better identify and engage stakeholders in management, anticipate effects of spatially explicit management decisions, and assess relative importance of different fisheries for attracting out-of-region or state trips, which may be important for local economies.",2018,,MARINE POLICY,87,,263-274,WOS:000419412200032,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.10.003,,#20108,Camp 2018,Exclusion reason: Wrong setting; ,
Identifying 'public values' for marine and coastal planning: Are residents and non-residents really so different?,"Munro, J; Pearce, J; Brown, G; Kobryn, H; Moore, SA","Planning and management for marine and coastal areas is often contentious, with competing interests claiming their preferences are in the 'public interest'. Defining the public interest for marine and coastal areas remains a wicked problem, however, resistant to resolution. A focus on more tangible 'public values' offers an alternative for policy and planning in specific contexts. However, ambiguity surrounds who or what constitutes the 'public', with stakeholder engagement often used as a proxy in marine and coastal research. In this study, the outcomes of participatory processes involving the public from diverse backgrounds and geographical locales were explored. A public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey was undertaken in the remote Kimberley region of Australia to identify the spatial values and management preferences for marine and coastal areas. Similarities and differences between the volunteer public (n = 372) and online panel respondents (n = 206); and for the volunteer public only, differences between residents (n = 118) and non-residents (n = 254) were assessed. Online panelists evidenced lesser quality mapping data and did not provide a reliable means of accessing 'public' values. Residents were more likely to map general recreational and recreational fishing values while non-locals were more likely to map biological/conservation and wilderness values. Overall, residents and non-residents were more alike than dissimilar in their mapping of values and management preferences, suggesting that the need to preference local views may be overstated, although there may be differences in policy priorities. Future research should focus on the breadth and representativeness of stakeholder interests to access the views of wider society and hence public values, rather than current approaches where local interests are often the primary focus of participatory stakeholder engagement.

"An assessment of governance of marine and coastal resources on Koh Tao, Thailand","Satumanatpan, S; Moore, P; Lentisco, A; Kirkman, H","This was the first assessment of marine and coastal resource governance on Koh Tao, a small island in the Western Gulf of Thailand. The study assessed perceptions of governance of marine and coastal resources among national and provincial authorities and Koh Tao residents on the basis of governance components law, institutions and process and governance principles transparency, participation, rule of law, accountability and access to justice. Governance to deal with the anticipated continued growth in marine-based tourism is challenged. The study identified misunderstandings about governance and governance weaknesses, which, if they are not addressed, will be obstacles to the future sustainable development of Koh Tao. The research findings indicate that supporting local governance will be key to maintaining sustainable use of marine and coastal resources on the island and ensuring the sustainability of the local economy, which depends on these resources. We suggest a number of recommendations that can apply generally in countries wishing to conserve marine and coastal biodiversity and use those resources sustainably on coasts and islands.

Comparing stakeholder perceptions with empirical outcomes from negotiated rulemaking policies: Is participant satisfaction a proxy for policy success?,"McDonald, SL; Lewison, RL; Roady, SE; Kramer, RJ; Rigling-Gallagher, D; Read, AJ","Evaluation of natural resource management policies often is made difficult by lack of robust or long-term data on the resource. In the absence of empirical data, natural resource policy evaluation may rely on expert or stakeholder perception of success as a proxy, particularly in the context of policies that depend on multi-stakeholder engagement or negotiated rulemaking. However, few formal evaluations have compared empirical ecological outcomes with stakeholder perception. This study compares stakeholder perceptions of policy outcomes with ecological outcomes from a long-term, ecological dataset as part of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act's Take Reduction Planning process. Structural Equation Models revealed that stakeholder perceptions were significantly and positively related to positive ecological outcomes. Also, perceived success and ecological performance rankings of the Take Reduction Plans were comparable for three of the five plans examined. This analysis suggests that for this particular policy instrument, stakeholder perception aligns well with ecological outcomes, and this positive relationship is likely the result of a commitment and support for stakeholder education and engagement. However, even within a single policy analysis, there was variability suggesting that the relationship between stakeholder perceptions and policy outcomes must continue to be evaluated. This study suggests that stakeholder perception can be an accurate reflection of ecological outcomes, but not necessarily a predictor of them. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Detecting ecosystem service trade-offs and synergies: A practice-oriented application in four industrialized estuaries,"Jacobs, S; Wolfstein, K; Vandenbruwaene, W; Vrebos, D; Beauchard, O; Mans, T; Meire, P","Estuaries connect terrestrial and marine biomes. Their ecological functioning is essential for marine matter fluxes, while their central economic role as transport hubs persists throughout history and has become ever more pronounced. Managing complex socio-ecological systems such as estuaries can benefit from an ecosystem service approach. The challenge is to combine highly complex knowledge, prone to uncertainties, to policy relevant information. This paper introduces a knowledge-based ecosystem service screening, applied in a participatory manner by including different stakeholders from four industrialized NW-European estuaries.The approach allowed to efficiently engage stakeholders from different, often opposing sectors, in order to derive a set of ecosystem services of high societal importance, link them to supply by habitats, and explore inter- and intra-estuarine variability. By introducing the notion of trade-offs and synergies and assessing these for estuaries, the interconnectedness and mutual interests for estuarine management measures were indicated. The screening is based on knowledge surveys among experts. Statistical reliability was acceptable, but to complement the assessment, quantitative validation on a local scale would be useful.Ecosystem service assessments, especially when engaging stakeholders, can inform policy on strategies for the sustainable use of ecosystem services in intensively used and ecologically fragile estuarine zones.

"Stakeholder perceptions of ecosystem service declines in Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea: Is human population a more critical driver than climate change?","Butler, JRA; Skewes, T; Mitchell, D; Pontio, M; Hills, T","Milne Bay Province (MBP) in Papua New Guinea is a priority seascape in the Coral Triangle marine biodiversity hotspot. Goal 4 of the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security promotes adaptation planning for small island ecosystems and communities threatened by climate change, but information to identify vulnerable islands and priority interventions is limited. This study adapted the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) framework in MBP with regional stakeholders to project trends in harvested or cultivated 'provisioning' ecosystem goods and services (EGS), human wellbeing, drivers of change and necessary management strategies, based on their tacit knowledge. In 2010 five island subregions which are susceptible to food insecurity were assessed. Workshop participants identified freshwater, garden food crops, coral, beche-de-mer, reef fish and sharks as the most important EGS in all subregions. Terrestrial EGS contributed 43% of aggregated ecosystem-derived well-being, and marine EGS 57%. By 2030 the overall condition of EGS was projected to decline by > 50%. The primary driver in all subregions was human population growth, and climate change impacts were predicted in only two subregions. Improved garden and agricultural productivity and population control were the highest ranked management strategies. Population relocation was also prioritised for two subregions where human carrying capacities may soon be exceeded. Although none of the strategies addressed climate change directly, all could yield climate adaptation and marine conservation co-benefits by enhancing ecosystem-based adaptation and community adaptive capacity. It is suggested that there is a 20-30 year 'adaptation window' in which to address population growth, which otherwise will continue to erode the capacity of communities and ecosystems to cope with potentially extreme climate impacts after mid-century.

"Including coastal resource users in fisheries management evaluation of San Miguel Bay, Philippines","Andalecio, MN","This paper examines an approach that integrates the judgment and perceptions of coastal resource users in prioritizing the criteria and indicators for fisheries management impact evaluation. Five criteria with corresponding indicators were identified and selected namely, acceptability, biotic diversity, economic performance, enforceability, and equity. The weights of importance of criteria and indicators were determined through the Analytic Hierarchy Process applied in a case study with 23 resource user groups (categorized as fishers, local government unit, non-government organization, private sector and women) in San Miguel Bay, Philippines.The results of this study revealed that overall, acceptability is the most important criterion in evaluating the impacts of fisheries management strategy in San Miguel Bay, especially for the local government units and fishers groups. The best measure of acceptability criterion are the indicators resource users participation in fisheries management process, level of awareness of resource users in fisheries resource management and number of fishers who belong to an organization. Ten groups have consistency ratios between 0.0 and 0.08 which are within the acceptable level of 0.10. Conversely, most groups (78%) have consistency ratios less than 0.26. Also, the results of the preference analysis are remarkable because among the representative groups, most fishers groups exhibited consistencies in their judgments (average consistency ratios of 0.06-0.08). Economic performance indicators were consistently judged across groups indicating that individuals present higher convergence of views toward economic objective. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Lessons from Integrating Fishers of Arapaima in Small-Scale Fisheries Management at the Mamiraua Reserve, Amazon","Castello, L; Viana, JP; Watkins, G; Pinedo-Vasquez, M; Luzadis, VA","Fishers and small-scale fisheries worldwide have been marginalized historically. Now it is clear that integrating fishers in management processes is key to resource conservation, but it is less clear how to do it. Here, based on a literature review and new information, we present and analyze a case in which the participation of fishers in the management process was crucial in recovering an overexploited small-scale fishery for the pirarucu (Arapaima spp.) in the Amazon Basin, Brazil. In 8 years of experimental management, from 1999 to 2006, the population of pirarucu increased 9-fold (from about 2200 to 20,650 individuals), harvest quotas increased 10-fold (from 120 to 1249 individuals), and fishers' participation in the management process increased and they benefited from increased monetary returns. Additionally, the number of communities conducting the management scheme increased from 4 in 1999 to 108 in 2006, following the demands of fishers and regional government agencies. Based on our analysis, we suggest that the participation of fishers in the management of other small-scale fisheries in the world can be improved by focusing on (1) applying the knowledge and skills of fishers in resource monitoring and management, (2) bridging knowledge systems among all involved stakeholders, (3) collaborating with fishers that are interested in, and capable of conducting, resource conservation schemes, and (4) conducting management under conditions of uncertainty.",2009,,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,43,2,197-209,WOS:000264175400002,10.1007/s00267-008-9220-5,,#20368,Castello 2009,Exclusion reason: Wrong setting; Ryan OConnor (2022-07-22 02:29:04)(Select): not the ocean; ,

Resolving conflicts in selecting a programme of fisheries science investigation,"Kerr, S; Johnson, K; Side, J; Baine, M; Davos, C; Henley, J","Investigation and illumination of the underlying conflicts within a community of fishers provided the context for the case study supporting this paper. The case study is based in the Scottish archipelago of Orkney which relies heavily on the marine environment for the well-being of its communities. This investigation goes beyond the conventional relationship between scientists and fishers, and places fishers in a position to identify a programme of scientific research for the benefit of their fishery. Participatory techniques are used to: (a) establish a collective research agenda of high priority subjects; (b) identify groups' statistically similar research priorities; (c) assess attitudes towards other stakeholders; (d) assess potential reaction to the research agenda. Special attention is given to dissemination of results. Key findings include a reluctance of fishermen to participate in meetings but a high level of participation through completion of questionnaires (in excess of 50%) after considerable personal contact with the research team. Partly reflecting the determination of those few who attended the meetings is the finding of the hostility they expressed towards fisheries science and research while a notably less hostile view was expressed in the returned confidential questionnaires. Cluster analysis identified four groups Of fishers expressing differing priorities for four possible research programmes. A lesson for policy makers is the nature of the approach to gain the benefit of the fishing community's participation into research policy decisions. Determined individuals in public forums may not reflect majority opinions and other avenues of participation might be more reflective of conflict management potential. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Social Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES), a PPGIS tool that systematizes the mapping and modeling of social values and cultural ecosystem services, is promising for use in coastal settings but has seen relatively limited applications relative to other PPGIS approaches; it has also, to our knowledge, not yet been applied in a barrier island setting. In this study, we surveyed two visitor groups and residents living near Cape Lookout National Seashore (North Carolina, USA) to understand their social values in the context of the park's management needs. We developed social-value models to evaluate differences between three user groups (fall visitors, summer visitors, and residents) and to evaluate how respondents' experiences, attitudes, and recreational activities influence the locations they value and their most strongly held value types, which included aesthetic, recreation, biodiversity, future, therapeutic, and historic values. We found that accessibility, user types and the seasonality of major recreational activities, and the linear configuration of the barrier island system at Cape Lookout are important influences on the social values held by visitors and residents.

Evaluation of the management of marine protected areas. Comparative study in Costa Rica,"Maestro, M.; Pérez-Cayeiro, M.L.; Morales-Ramírez, Á.; Chica-Ruiz, J.A.","Costa Rica is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, and stands out for its commitment to conservation. Along its two coasts, it presents a great heterogeneity of ecosystems and social realities. Social factors, more than physical-natural factors, determine the success or failure of an MPA, so they must be urgently incorporated into all phases of MPA management. The objective of this work is to analyze the management of three marine protected areas, to establish improvements. These areas are Santa Rosa National Park, Marino Ballena National Park and Cahuita National Park. The methodology used assesses 26 indicators grouped into 4 key factotres: management body, planning subprocess, public participation, and implementation subprocess. The results of this evaluation are 5 possible scenarios. These scenarios have been termed (from the ideal situation to the least favourable): proactive (1), learning (2), interactive (3), centralized (4) and formal (5) management. The results of this study show that both Santa Rosa and Cahuita present a proactive scenario (1), with high citizen participation, although in practice the way the two MPAs are managed is very different.

In general, MPA management in Costa Rica tends to be adaptive, with high public participation, as determined by its public policies. However, the existence of a public policy favors but does not guarantee success in MPA management, as can be seen in the difference in results.

Ensuring the Sustainability of Coastal Small-Scale Fisheries at Pitcairn Island (South Pacific) Within a Large Scale No-Take MPA,"Duffy, H.J.; Letessier, T.B.; Koldewey, H.J.; Dawson, T.P.; Irving, R.A.","The Pitcairn Islands, located in the central South Pacific, contain near-pristine marine ecosystems which support unique fish assemblages, together with both endemic and threatened species. Pitcairn itself is the only inhabited island in the group and, before this study, the environmental impact of local fisheries was unclear, with little data to inform conservation and management. In 2014–2015 coastal fish populations were assessed using a mixed methods approach: a newly introduced system of fishers’ catch monitoring and Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVS). Thirty-nine BRUVS deployments recorded 88 species in total, with small-bodied herbivores (e.g., Kyphosus pacificus) and mesopredators (e.g., Xanthichthys mento) dominating a “bottom heavy” assemblage. Several large pelagic predators were recorded, but reef-associated predators were rare with only one shark observed. Pitcairn’s top predator assemblage was relatively impoverished compared to global “pristine” sites, including other islands within the Pitcairn group. Top predator scarcity may be explained by local artisanal fisheries, which have historically targeted sharks and other large reef carnivores, and these taxa may not have recovered despite subsequent declines in fishing pressure. The dominant small-bodied species may have proliferated as a result of diminished top predator populations. Subsequent to BRUVS sampling, a local fisheries officer post was created to collate catch data from coastal fishers. Regular returns were obtained from over half of the active fishers (representing approximately 80% of catches), with K. pacificus also dominating catches and the small grouper Epinephelus fasciatus frequently targeted. Thirty fish species were represented in the recorded catch over a 12 month period. Results were shared with the local community, providing a basis for the cooperative design of a Fisheries Management Plan. This plan ensured traditional fisheries could continue in a sustainable manner within Coastal Conservation Zones around each of the four Pitcairn Islands, established within the large, no-take Marine Protected Area designated in 2016, covering the entire Pitcairn Exclusive Economic Zone. Monitoring of Pitcairn’s artisanal fisheries should be continued beyond this one-off study in order to inform adjustment of the Fisheries Management Plan, as the ongoing island fishery may still have consequences for long-term sustainability, particularly for pelagic species caught in coastal waters which remain a significant data gap. © Copyright © 2021 Duffy, Letessier, Koldewey, Dawson and Irving.",2021,,Frontiers in Marine Science,8,,,,10.3389/fmars.2021.647685,,#20545,Duffy 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Marine Protected Area Watch and Marine Monitor (M2) RADAR Technology: Case Studies in Anthropogenic Use Monitoring in California's Marine Protected Areas,"Kemsley, A.; Pukini, C.","The efficacy of marine protected areas (MPAs) in California relies on human knowledge, understanding, and compliance with site-specific regulations, managed and enforced by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Two anthropogenic use studies, MPA Watch and Marine Monitor (M2) RADAR, are emerging tools for monitoring, adaptive management, and enforcement in California's MPA network. MPA Watch is a network of programs that supports healthy oceans by training community scientist volunteers to collect anthropogenic use data in and around MPAs. Non-consumptive, passive beach recreation is the most common activity accounting for 68.2% of recorded activities, suggesting education and outreach activities to foster awareness of and respect for coastal spaces are the most appropriate intervention. Potential poaching accounts for $\lt 1.0$% of all recorded activities, though it is important to note that even low levels of poaching within MPAs can decrease biodiversity. M2 RADAR combines commercial-off-the-shelf marine radar hardware with a custom software solution written using open-source tools to track vessel activity and poaching behavior in nearshore waters out to 5 miles. From January 2019 to April 2021 more than 90 cases of active poaching were reported and cross-referenced with M2 RADAR data, resulting in additional MPA patrols by California Department of Fish and Wildlife and City of San Diego Lifeguards. Users can make contact with potential violators, verify boat-based activity, and distribute informational material highlighting MPA boundaries and regulations, thus providing an efficient, low-cost tool for monitoring potential poaching behavior in real-time. © 2021 MTS.",2021,,,2021-September,,,,10.23919/OCEANS44145.2021.9705745,,#20567,Kemsley 2021,Exclusion reason: Not a peer-reviewed article; ,
"The sharks and rays of Palau: Biological diversity, status, and social and cultural dimensions","Hari, K.; Jaiteh, V.; Chin, A.","Anthropogenic pressures have been increasing on shark and ray populations globally, and their conservation and management can be compromised by lack of information on their diversity and status of species. This study presents a desktop review of the sharks and rays of the Republic of Palau, drawing on citizen science, fisheries data and other scientific literature to document their diversity, economic and cultural values, and pressures affecting their populations. This account of Palau's sharks and rays includes a preliminary assessment of risks based-on existing risk assessments, and their biological productivity. Records were found documenting 56 sharks and rays in Palau: 31 species are considered here as 'confirmed and verified', 10 species as 'requires verification', and 11 species listed as 'plausible'. An additional two species are listed as 'unlikely', and two species is 'unknown' due to the taxonomy being unclear. The biological productivity analysis showed that the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) had the lowest productivity of Palau's sharks and rays, while the blue shark (Prionace glauca) showed the highest productivity of species examined. Historically, fishing mortality presented the most significant threat to Palau's sharks and rays, but recent conservation initiatives have the potential to significantly reduce this threat as large areas are closed to fishing following the full implementation of the Palau National Marine Sanctuary in 2020. Palau's sharks have a wide range of social and cultural values and are important to tourism. This study presents a new synthesis and overview of available information including citizen science, but also highlights the need for further local taxonomic work and research. © 2021",2021,,Pacific Conservation Biology,,,,,10.1071/PC20063,,#20570,Hari 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Incorporation of Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) into Biodiversity Management and Climate Change Variability Scenarios for Threatened Fish Species and Fishing Communities—Communication Patterns Among BioResources Users as a Prerequisite for Co-management,"Braga, H.O.; Pardal, M.Â.; Azeiteiro, U.M.","Under current marine environmental problems and climate change scenarios, marine reserves emerge as an alternative management tool to protect marine resources and biodiversity and local ecological knowledge (LEK) can provide a valuable base for resource management. This study approaches the current situation of artisanal fisheries in two marine protected areas (MPAs) and proposes biodiversity management scenarios, under a changing climate, using fishers’ local ecological knowledge (LEK) in two hemispheres: The Berlenga Marine Natural Reserve (Berlenga MNR), Portugal and the Marine Extractive Reserve (Resex-Mar) of Arraial do Cabo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The most targeted species of artisanal fisheries in both protected areas were reviewed for habitat use, threats and conservation status. The use of LEK is a powerful tool for developing new conservation strategies namely dealing with climate change responses of biological bioresources and fishing communities’ adaptation. Participatory management by all users in a protected area is regarded as an effective means to improve decision making among stakeholders. LEK studies of taxonomy, population dynamics, ecology, habitat use, threats, and reproduction as well as the assessment of this information for artisanal fisheries are still very scarce in Europe and Brazil. The use of LEK provides important biological information and insight into the attitudes of fishermen towards biodiversity conservation in both MPAs. Other MPAs in mainland Portugal and the Madeira and Azores Autonomic Regions are also potential areas for the administration of LEK studies. Also the social network used for communication of knowledge and information related to natural resources among different professionals and resource extractors operating in a coastal seascape is critical under a scenario of biodiversity loss and climate change impacts. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",2018,,Climate Change Management,,,237-262,,10.1007/978-3-319-70066-3_16,,#20746,Braga 2018,Exclusion reason: Not a peer-reviewed article; ,
Incorporating spatial dynamics greatly increases estimates of long-term fishing effort: A participatory mapping approach,"Selgrath, J.C.; Gergel, S.E.; Vincent, A.C.J.","The location and intensity of small-scale fishing is dynamic over time, greatly shaping ecosystems. However, historical information about fishing effort and fishing gear-use are often unavailable. Within a marine biodiversity hotspot in the Philippines, we characterized spatio-temporal dynamics of fishing (1960-2010) using participatory mapping. First, we compared non-spatial and spatial estimates of total fishing effort. Our non-spatial estimate indicated that fishing increased 2.5 fold, reaching 1.3 million fishing days per year in 2010. Yet, spatial estimates showed fishing effort increased >20 fold, with the highest effort in 1990. Second, we evaluated how spatial characteristics of fishing changed over time. We introduced a method to estimate the sample size of fishers needed to accurately map the extent of fishing. By 2000, fishing extent grew 50% and small-scale fisheries affected over 90% of the coastal ocean. The expanded fishing area coincided with a greater spatial overlap among fishing gears and a proliferation of intensive fishing gears (destructive, active, non-selective). The expansion and intensification of fishing shown here emphasize the need for spatial approaches to management that focus on intensive, and often illegal, fishing gears. Such approaches are critical in targeting conservation actions (e.g. gear restrictions) in the most vulnerable areas. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2017.

Drivers of coral reef marine protected area performance,"Hargreaves-Allen, V.A.; Mourato, S.; Milner-Gulland, E.J.","Coral reefs are severely threatened and a principal strategy for their conservation is marine protected areas (MPAs). However the drivers of MPA performance are complex and there are likely to be trade-offs between different types of performance (e.g. conservation or welfare related outcomes). We compiled a global dataset from expert knowledge for 76 coral reef MPAs in 33 countries and identified a set of performance measures reflecting ecological and socio-economic outcomes, achievement of aims and reduction of threats, using spatial or temporal comparisons wherever possible. We wanted to test the extent to which distinct types of performance occurred simultaneously, understood as win-win outcomes. Although certain performance measures were correlated, most were not, suggesting trade-offs that limit the usefulness of composite performance scores. Hypotheses were generated as to the impact of MPA features, aims, location, management and contextual variables on MPA performance from the literature. A multivariate analysis was used to test hypotheses as to the relative importance of these ""drivers"" on eight uncorrelated performance measures. The analysis supported some hypotheses (e.g. benefit provision for the local community improved performance), but not others (e.g. higher overall budget and more research activity did not). Factors endogenous to the MPA (such as size of the no-take area) were generally more significant drivers of performance than exogenous ones (such as national GDP). Different types of performance were associated with different drivers, exposing the trade-offs inherent in management decisions. The study suggests that managers are able to influence MPA performance in spite of external threats and could inform adaptive management by providing an approach to test for the effects of MPA features and management actions in different contexts and so to inform decisions for allocation of effort or funds to achieve specific goals. © 2017 Hargreaves-Allen et al.

Efficient and equitable design of marine protected areas in Fiji through inclusion of stakeholder-specific objectives in conservation planning,"Gurney, G.G.; Pressey, R.L.; Ban, N.C.; Álvarez-Romero, J.G.; Jupiter, S.; Adams, V.M.","The efficacy of protected areas varies, partly because socioeconomic factors are not sufficiently considered in planning and management. Although integrating socioeconomic factors into systematic conservation planning is increasingly advocated, research is needed to progress from recognition of these factors to incorporating them effectively in spatial prioritization of protected areas. We evaluated 2 key aspects of incorporating socioeconomic factors into spatial prioritization: treatment of socioeconomic factors as costs or objectives and treatment of stakeholders as a single group or multiple groups. Using as a case study the design of a system of no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) in Kubulau, Fiji, we assessed how these aspects affected the configuration of no-take MPAs in terms of trade-offs between biodiversity objectives, fisheries objectives, and equity in catch losses among fisher stakeholder groups. The achievement of fisheries objectives and equity tended to trade-off concavely with increasing biodiversity objectives, indicating that it is possible to achieve low to mid-range biodiversity objectives with relatively small losses to fisheries and equity. Importantly, the extent of trade-offs depended on the method used to incorporate socioeconomic data and was least severe when objectives were set for each fisher stakeholder group explicitly. We found that using different methods to incorporate socioeconomic factors that require similar data and expertise can result in plans with very different impacts on local stakeholders. © 2015, Society for Conservation Biology.",2015,,Conservation Biology,29,5,1378-1389,,10.1111/cobi.12514,,#20847,Gurney 2015,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
"Ecological, socioeconomic and governance conditions after the implementation of the first spatial plan in the Prof. Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (Arrábida, Portugal): II - user perceptions ","Stratoudakis, Y.; Fernández, F.; Henriques, M.; Martins, J.; Martins, R.","The Prof. Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (PMLS - Arrábida, Portugal) was created in 1998 and has been managed according to a spatial plan since 2005. This study presents the results from an inquiry on the perceptions of PMLS users in relation to the ecological, socioeconomic and governance situation in the Park 4-7 years after the phased implementation of spatial rules in this Marine Protected Area (MPA). The 37 questions on the social-ecological system and some auxiliary questions were answered by 64 PMLS users from six categories: fishers operating outside the MPA, recreational fishers, divers, researchers, public administration and others. A distinct sampling strategy was followed for each user category depending on the level of previous knowledge of people with high level of familiarity with the questionnaire issues (close to a census on researchers and public administration members with specific activity in PMLS; snowball sampling for professional and recreational fishers; and provision of contacts of experienced divers from the Portuguese Centre of Sub-aquatic Activities). Respondents were asked to indicate their perception of improvement (moderate or large), stability or deterioration (moderate or large) on an ordinal scale of possible responses (5 levels Likert-type scale) for each of the issues at question. In total, 1694 replies were obtained to the 2368 questions placed (response rate of 71.5%, with the great majority of non-response being due to lack of knowledge). Aggregated replies were used to construct trend indicators on issues relevant for any MPA and were compared statistically with a series of samples from a theoretical distribution of replies centered in the lack of change (standardized normal distribution, truncated at 2 standard deviations). The effect of respondent opinion on the PMLS was tested by comparing the distribution of replies between ""optimists"" (people whose opinion of the PMLS improved in the last 4-5 years) and others. Overall, user replies indicate a positive view on the evolution of the PMLS and its interaction with small scale fisheries until 2012, with 2.04 replies of perceived improvement for every reply of perceived deterioration. This ratio was substantially lower for socioeconomic issues, where a perceived significant improvement in PMLS knowledge and its dissemination were counterbalanced by a perceived deterioration in the ability of excluded fishers to maintain a living related to fishing and the attraction of fishing as employment for youth. This contrast is also detected when comparing the distribution of replies to 5 socioeconomic and governance questions identically phrased with respect to fishers and other users: on two issues (earnings and management solutions) the same group of respondents considered that the evolution in the last 4-5 years was significantly better for other users than for fishers (although no significant difference was found in the evolution of group conflicts with the MPA managing authority). Variation in replies was detected among user categories (mainly in ecological issues), while significant differences between the replies of ""optimists"" and others were only found in 6 questions (PMLS acceptance by fishers, other users and local community; attraction of fishing as employment for youth; coverage by brown macroalgae and sightings of seabirds and marine mammals). Comparing these results with those of the inquiry to PMLS fishers (Stratoudakis et al., 2015) there is a prevalence of a divergence in perceptions for ecological issues (with PMLS fishers not detecting the improvements perceived by other users) and a convergence in socioeconomic and governance issues (both those indicating improvement and those indicating deterioration). The joint objective of these two studies is to inform the management effectiveness evaluation that is included in the process of revision of the spatial plan for the PMLS and to set the basis for a longitudinal monitoring plan focusing on participatory methods.",2015,,Journal of Integrated Coastal Zone Management,15,2,167-178,,10.5894/rgci572,,#20854,Stratoudakis 2015,Exclusion reason: Non-English; ,Language
Transboundary socio-ecological effects of a marine protected area in the southwest atlantic,"Lopes, P.F.M.; Silvano, R.A.M.; Nora, V.A.; Begossi, A.","Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been regarded as an alternative to protect natural resources and to improve fisheries. However, MPAs may also have negative socio-economic consequences on fishing communities. We aimed to check the effectiveness of a socially conflicting MPA in Brazil by assessing target reef fish biomass in islands inside (n = 6) and outside (n = 6) the MPA, fisheries' productivity (biomass), catch per unit of effort (CPUE), and fishers' socio-economic status (mainly fishers' income) in three fishing communities subjected to different degrees of influence (close, average, and long distance) of the MPA. The CPUE was higher in the fishing community that was further away from the MPA, fish biomass was higher in the islands located inside the MPA in the southern region and in the islands located outside the MPA in the northern region, while fishers were making the most money closest to the MPA, where conflicts are the highest, probably from practicing very intensive fisheries. This integrated approach showed that the studied MPA has not delivered ecological benefits, such as higher CPUE or more fish, while higher income closer to the MPA could not be clearly attributed to its effects. © 2013 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",2013,,Ambio,42,8,963-974,,10.1007/s13280-013-0452-0,,#20915,Lopes 2013,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Ingham earth Smarties: Using a curriculum delivery model to engage a rural cluster of schools in a Catchment water quality monitoring project,"Venn, L.; Way, C.; Di Bella, L.P.; Nash, M.","IN 2011, NEARLY two hundred students at eleven State primary schools located in the Herbert River catchment near Ingham participated in the Herbert Water Quality Monitoring Project. Five of these schools were also involved in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's Reef Guardian Schools program. The Herbert Water Quality Monitoring Project is an ongoing project involving agencies representing primary industries (mostly cane and cattle), local government, scientific and natural resource management bodies. The project provides insight to land management practices. The lower Herbert catchment is mostly cane land and borders both the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. Conscious management of farm run-off by cane farmers and of stream water quality by the whole community is therefore essential. The schools' section of the Herbert Water Quality Monitoring Project was based on the Earth Smarties, curriculum delivery model developed in 2010 by teachers working in two Queensland Department of Education programs focused on the teaching of science and sustainability at primary school level, and another departmental program aimed at introducing digital technologies to classrooms. The Earth Smarties, model has four steps: (1) Find partners with synergistic objectives; (2) Resource the project; (3) Provide professional development and training; (4) Celebrate achievements. This paper documents the implementation of a catchment water quality monitoring project at school level and the engagement of the local stakeholder agencies in the project. It also makes recommendations on how the Earth Smarties, model could be applied to other catchments and with other projects. The intention is to encourage and support the future engagement of school communities by other cane growing and natural resource agencies in significant local projects.",2013,,,,,217-226,,,,#20958,Venn 2013,Exclusion reason: Not a peer-reviewed article; ,not peer reviewed
Stakeholders' expectations towards a proposed marine protected area: A multi-criteria analysis of MPA performance criteria,"Heck, N.; Dearden, P.; McDonald, A.","In order to enable effective management of marine protected areas (MPAs), desired MPA achievements need to be identified as early as possible for the development of relevant and clear management goals, objectives and conservation targets. As the definition of MPA success is a social construct, the involvement of multiple groups in this process including government agencies, stakeholders, and other interested parties is increasingly advocated. This study investigates diverse groups' opinions on the performance of a proposed National Marine Conservation Area (NMCA) on the West coast of Canada prior to its establishment. In order to analyse and quantify the importance of MPA performance criteria among multiple stakeholder groups, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied. Findings reveal that marine stakeholder groups have distinct preferences for future MPA performance. Most differences are obvious between user and non-user groups. The study also finds that respondents' characteristics other than stakeholder groups affiliations influence expectations towards the proposed MPA including livelihood dependency on the marine environment, amount of time spent in the area, and engagement in fishing activities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2011,,Ocean and Coastal Management,54,9,687-695,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2011.07.003,,#21032,Heck 2011,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Emerging marine protected area networks in the coral triangle: Lessons and way forward,"Green, S.J.; White, A.T.; Christie, P.; Kilarski, S.; Meneses, A.B.T.; Samonte-Tan, G.; Karrer, L.B.; Fox, H.; Campbell, S.; Claussen, J.D.","Marine protected areas (MPAs) and MPA networks are valuable tools for protecting coral reef habitats and managing near-shore fisheries, while playing an essential role in the overall conservation of marine biodiversity. In addition, MPAs and their networks are often the core strategy for larger scale and more integrated forms of marine resource management that can lead to ecosystem-based management regimes for seascapes and eco-regions. This study conducted in 2008 documents the status of selected MPAs and MPA networks in Indonesia, Philippines and Papua New Guinea, to better understand development and their level of success in the Coral Triangle. Findings reveal that substantial gaps exist between the theory and practice of creating functional MPA networks. Across these sites, biophysical and social science knowledge, required to build functional and effective MPAs or MPA networks, lagged behind substantially. Aspects that appeared to require the most attention to improve MPA network effectiveness included essential management systems, institutional arrangements, governance and sustainable financing. Common indicators of success such as increased fish catch and habitat quality parameters were consistently associated with several independent variables: sustainable financing for management, clarity of MPA network rules, enforcement by community level enforcers, local skills development, and involvement in management by local elected politicians, a functional management board, multi-stakeholder planning mechanisms and participatory biophysical assessments. Conclusions are that although considerable investments have been made in MPAs and potential MPA networks in the Coral Triangle, management effectiveness is generally poor throughout the region and that not many large, formally declared MPAs are well managed.

Review: Capacity building in science and management for sustainable development of coral reefs. An example from the MesoAmerican Barrier Reef,"Crabbe, M.J.C.; Martinez, E.; Garcia, C.; Chub, J.; Castro, L.; Guy, J.","Capacity building, the enhancement of the skills of people and the capacity of institutions in resources management through education and training, implying a sharing of knowledge, and a partnership of trust, is a important tool in the sustainable development of coral reefs. While many, if not all, capacity-building programmes involve building competencies and empowerment in local communities, fewer involve policy makers or government officials. We discuss a capacity-building exercise around Marine Protected areas (MPAs) in the MesoAmerican Barier Reef which involved both local NGO community workers and a government fisheries officer, so that community engagement could be directly interfaced with fisheries operations and policy. There were two components: (i), field research which took place in the Sapodilla Cayes Marine Reserve (SCMR) and the Port Honduras Marine Reserve (PHMR); (ii), discussions employing a modified nominal group technique and Delphi technique on issues related to the management of the reserves, strategic plans and action plans. Outcomes of the study included: (i), transfer of scientific skills in coral measurement and analysis to the Belizean participants; the team measured 523 non-branching corals, and it was found that hurricanes and severe storms limited the recruitment of massive coral colonies in both marine reserves (p<0.02). The skills thus learned can be used in the future to measure the effects of climate change and acute or chronic environmental effects on coral colony growth.(ii), Thirty priorites were developed for a better marine resource management zoning plan.An additional positive outcome is that the two local NGOs have been incorporated into a single NGO, which spans several MPAs in Southern Belize.

"Physico-chemical characteristics of negative estuaries in the Northern Gulf of California, Mexico","Morzaria-Luna, H.N.; Iris-Maldonado, A.; Valdivia-Jiménez, P.","We describe water quality in two hypersaline negative estuaries in the Northern Gulf of California, along the coast of Sonora, Mexico, over a two-year period. In the Northern Gulf, non-mangrove salt marshes known as esteros (negative estuaries) cover 134, 623 ha. Esteros are characterized by an extreme tidal range, higher salinity at their head than at their mouth due to high evaporation, limited freshwater input and a mixed semi-diurnal tidal regime. Between 2005 and 2007, we sampled surface temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, pH, depth, chlorophyll, nutrients (NH+4, NO3-, NO2-, and PO4), and total suspended solids across one wetland, Estero Morúa. We also led a participatory monitoring effort, where oyster farmers took daily measurements of surface temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen in both Estero Morúa (31°17'09"" N; 113° 26'19"" W) and Estero Almejas (31°10'15"" N; 113°03'53"" W). These sites allow comparisons between distinct habitats and levels of oceanic influence. Estero Morúa is a high energy lagoon with a narrow mouth and a prominent permanent channel restricted by spits, while Almejas is an open bay with a large intertidal mudflat. Among the main findings are 1) Surface temperatures follow a seasonal pattern, with highest temperatures in June to September and lowest from December to February. 2) Low rainfall and runoff together with high seawater input and evaporative loss results in high salinities. 3) High dissolved oxygen concentrations and low nutrient levels are indicative of the recharge rate between the wetlands and the sea, and are characteristic of oligotrophic systems. It is likely that residence time and tidal dynamics are the main factors dictating the physicochemical dynamics of these systems. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

"GIS and participatory approach for zoning marine protected area: A case of Phu Quo, Vietnam","Shrestha, R.P.; Vinh, M.K.","The objective of this study was to delineate the potential areas for marine conservation, particularly marine protected area establishment in 5 km buffer of Phu Quoc Island. Data were prepared using number of methods, such as use of remote sensing data, interview of key informants, field survey and observation, local participatory mapping, stakeholder analysis, institutional analysis and assessment, and seminar-workshop. The study established and used a spatial database of Phu Quoc, including natural conditions, socioeconomic conditions and biodiversity data. The potential area for marine conservation was delineated based on seven criteria: biophysical condition, distribution of seagrass, coral reefs, rare/ precious species, fishery resources, inland planning, and human activities, which were independently assessed. An integrated marine conservation potential area zoning, based on multi-criteria analysis in GIS revealed that 16.9, 49.3, and 33.8% are marine surface water area of high, moderate, and low potential category.",2009,,,1,,423-428,,,,#21121,Shrestha 2009,"Exclusion reason: Not a peer-reviewed article; Kimberly Cheung (2022-07-29 05:55:52)(Select): Added a paper that goes by a different title, but seems to be the same study/location; ",missing; not peer reviewed
Evaluating economic efficiency of innovative management regimes,"Buisman, E.; Frost, H.; Hoff, A.; Murillas, A.; Powell, J.P.","The objective of this chapter is to estimate the likely implications for economic efficiency from the introduction of various innovative management systems in a number of European fisheries. Bio-economic models are developed to simulate and evaluate the impact of the management systems as they are applied to the following fisheries: Baltic cod (Gadus morhua), North Sea flatfish, Spanish northern hake (Merluccius merluccius), Faroe cod, haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and saithe (Pollachius virens). For each fishery, a number of scenarios are evaluated and ranked according to economic performance measures. The analyses suggest that economic performance is significantly influenced by the type of management system implemented. With respect to participatory governance, it is shown that in the part of the northern hake fishery exploited by Spain, the introduction of participatory governance provides better economic performance in the long-run when compared to the more traditional total allowable catch (TAC) system. With respect to effort-based control, it is shown in both the Faroe and the North Sea cases that rights-based effort control can have both positive and negative implications for economic performance when compared to TAC systems. In the North Sea case, the impact on economic performance is shown to depend on how effort restrictions are set. Finally, it is shown that marine protected areas may influence the economic performance of fisheries negatively in the short and medium term, even though this effort-based control system has a positive influence on recovery of fish stocks. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",2009,,Comparative Evaluations of Innovative Fisheries Management: Global Experiences and European Prospects,,,143-162,,10.1007/978-90-481-2663-7_7,,#21124,Buisman 2009,Exclusion reason: Not a peer-reviewed article; Kimberly Cheung (2022-07-08 13:21:08)(Select): Participatory assessment in the Western Shelf - Hake section; ,

Planning future landscapes in the Wet Tropics of Australia: A social-ecological framework,"Bohnet, I.; Smith, D.M.","The Wet Tropics of North Queensland are characterised by a mixture of natural and agricultural landscapes that exist side-by-side. The need for greater protection of the Great Barrier Reef, a declining sugar industry and increasing pressures to subdivide agricultural land for urban expansion provide great challenges for the people in the Wet Tropics, but also for planners, natural resource managers and policy makers. To create pathways for planning sustainable landscapes in the Wet Tropics, a social-ecological framework has been developed and evaluated using two case studies. The aim of this paper is to describe the rationale for developing this social-ecological framework and its three stages. We also describe a range of participatory tools for engaging local people (including farmers, industry representatives, interest groups, indigenous people, and decision-makers) throughout the planning process. Evidence from the case studies suggests that the inclusion of the social dimension of landscape, and the participatory activities that are an integral part of the framework, provide opportunities for social learning and capacity building.

Rapid Assessment of Marine Pollution (RAMP),"Bowen, R.E.; Depledge, M.H.","RAMP embraces the integrated use of methods for the rapid measurement, assessment and access to information on the nature, sources and influences of coastal environmental change. It embraces approaches held in the literature, research and programs of RAMP (Rapid Assessment of Marine Pollution) and the emerging work described as RASE (Rapid Assessment of Socio-Economic Indicators). To protect coastal ecosystems and the health of communities effectively, management infrastructure requires the tools and resources necessary to detect damage to coastal ecosystems and their components, identify causative agents, impose remedial action, and demonstrate that measures have been effective. Pragmatic monitoring and prediction capabilities must also be built to provide further confidence that human impacts are being minimized and that threats to human health have been contained. For most of the world, however, the ability to build such capability is a technical challenge and often cost prohibitive. These constraints point to the need to develop and expand the integrated use of simple, robust, cost-effective environmental assessment procedures.

"A review of acid sulfate soil impacts, actions and policies that impact on water quality in Great Barrier Reef catchments, including a case study on remediation at East Trinity","Powell, B.; Martens, M.","An estimated 666 000 ha of acid sulfate soils (ASS) occur within the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments of Queensland, Australia. Extensive areas have been drained causing acidification, metal contamination, deoxygenation and iron precipitation in reef receiving waters. The close proximity of ASS to reef waters makes them a substantial threat to water quality. Another important issue linked with ASS is their release of soluble iron, which is known to stimulate nuisance marine algal blooms, in particular Lyngbya majuscula. Known blooms of the cyanobacteria in reef waters have been confirmed at Shoalwater Bay, Corio Bay, the Whitsunday area and Hinchinbrook Channel. Acid sulfate soils are intimately related to coastal wetland landscapes. Where landscapes containing ASS have been disturbed (such as for agriculture, aquaculture, marinas, etc.) the biodiversity of adjacent wetlands can be adversely affected. However, there is no clear knowledge of the real extent of the so-called ""hotspot"" ASS areas that occur within the GBR catchments. Management of ASS in reef catchments has benefited from the implementation of the Queensland Acid Sulfate Soils Management Strategy through policy development, mapping, training programs, an advisory service, research and community participation. However, major gaps remain in mapping the extent and nature of ASS. Areas of significant acidification (i.e. hotspots) need to be identified and policies developed for their remediation. Research has a critical role to play in understanding ASS risk and finding solutions, to prevent the adverse impacts that may be caused by ASS disturbance. A case study is presented of the East Trinity site near Cairns, a failed sugar cane development that episodically discharges large amounts of acid into Trinity Inlet, resulting in periodic fish kills. Details are presented of scientific investigations, and a lime-assisted tidal exchange strategy that are being undertaken to remediate a serious ASS problem. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"Informing natural resources policy making using participatory rapid economic valuation (PREV): The case of the Togean Islands, Indonesia","Cannon, J.; Surjadi, P.","Policy makers in Southeast Asia rarely have complete information to guide their land-use and development decision-making. This paper presents participatory rapid economic valuation (PREV), a practical tool that: (1) provides decision-makers with enough information of adequate quality to guide land-use and development decisions; (2) helps ensure decisions reflect the best available research findings; (3) be widely applicable. In order to achieve these goals, PREV results must be credible to decision-makers, requiring that the methods, data and assumptions used be easily understood, transparent and perceived as reasonable. The economic valuation work should also be carried out in a participatory consensus-building fashion so that the knowledge of local stakeholders is fully utilized, and a wide range of decision-makers are aware of and agree with the findings. PREV must also be rapid enough to respond to real-world policy making time lines, easily carried out and inexpensive if it is to be widely used. These requirements largely restricted PREV valuation analyses to those using currently available data, which are generally market-based. While such an approach provides only a partial valuation (a minimum lower bound on the actual total economic value), in many cases a partial valuation may be sufficient to guide land-use and development decisions. In these cases, the social costs of only a few impacts may be greater than the private profits of the activity, enabling development decisions to be made using only current information. An analysis using currently available data is the first step in an iterative process. If the values based on currently available data are not sufficient, then additional data can be collected and further analyses carried out. Case study results are presented of a PREV carried out with local government officials making natural resource policy decisions for the Togean Islands in Sulawesi, Indonesia. The results showed that decision-makers were sufficiently satisfied with analyses based on currently available data to make certain decisions. A consensus was reached that local societal economic interests would be best served by prohibiting further logging and pursuing a multiple-use conservation strategy, both as a basis for tourism and to allow the continued use of marine and terrestrial biodiversity. However, the workshop participants recommended that an improved understanding of community livelihoods and incentives was required before firm decisions regarding zoning and managing the islands could be made. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

"Involving indigenous peoples in protected area management: Comparative perspectives from Nepal, Thailand, and China","Nepal, S.K.","Despite over two decades of efforts towards involving indigenous and traditional peoples in protected area management, there are few successful examples. Several international principles and guidelines on indigenous peoples' involvement in protected areas exist. However, because of the lack of evaluation of whether or not these principles and guidelines have been put into practice, there is hardly any information that indicates the actual involvement of indigenous peoples in protected areas. This paper attempts to compare efforts in partnership between indigenous peoples and protected area authority in three Asian countries: Nepal, Thailand, and China. It shows that the involvement of indigenous peoples is more successful where park planning is participatory and where political and socioeconomic reforms are underway. Indigenous peoples are in conflict with park authorities where park management is centralized and nonparticipatory. Unless concrete efforts are made to address livelihood issues of indigenous peoples living in and around protected areas, park management aimed to protect wildlife will rarely succeed. Participatory park management that involves indigenous peoples and that addresses livelihood issues of indigenous communities will ultimately succeed in its efforts toward wildlife conservation.",2002,,Environmental Management,30,6,748-763,,10.1007/s00267-002-2710-y,,#21456,Nepal 2002,Exclusion reason: Wrong setting; ,
Latin American benthic shellfisheries: Emphasis on co-manageent and experimental practices,"Castilla, J.C.; Defeo, O.","In Latin America the small-scale fishery of marine benthic invertebrates is based on high-value species. It represents a source of food and employment and generates important incomes to fishers and, in some cases, export earnings for the countries. In the review, we define 2 key concepts: Small-scale fishery and co-management. We address the temporal extractive phases which Latin American shellfish resources have experienced, and the corresponding socio-economic and managerial scenarios. We include 3 study cases in which co-management and field experimentation have been used on different temporal and spatial scales: (a) the muricid gastropod (Concholepas concholepas) in Chile; (b) the yellow clam (Mesodesma mactroides) in Uruguay; and (c) the spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) in Mexico. We demonstrate that co-management constitutes an effective institutional arrangement by which fishers, scientists and managers interact to improve the quality of the regulatory process and may serve to sustain Latin American shellfisheries over time. The main factors supporting co-management are: (a) a comparatively reduced scale of fishing operations and well-defined boundaries for the management unit; (b) the allocation of institutionalized co-ownership authority to fishers; (c) the voluntary participation of the fishers in enforcing regulations; (d) the improvement of scientific information (including data from fishers) to consolidate the management schemes; (e) the incorporation of community traditions and idiosyncrasies; and (f) the allocation of territorial use rights for fisheries under a collaborative/voluntary community framework. Chile is identified as an example in which basic ecological and fishery concepts have been institutionalized through management practices and incorporated into the Law. Several factors have precluded shellfishery management success in most of the Latin American countries: (a) the social and political instability, (b) the underestimation of the role of fisheries science in management advice, (c) the inadequacy of data collection and information systems, (d) the poor implementation and enforcement of management practices and (e) the uncertainty in short-term economic issues. In the review, we also show that in Latin America, large-scale fishery experiments are starting to play an important role in the evaluation of alternative management policies on benthic shellfisheries, especially when accompanied by co-management approaches that explicitly involve the participation of fishers. Fisher exclusion experiments have demonstrated changes in unexploited benthic shellfish populations and in the structure and functioning of communities. The information has been used by scientists to approach system elasticity. Ecological and fishery related knowledge has been translated into novel co-managerial strategies. The sedentary nature of the shellfish species analyzed in this review allowed localized experiments with different levels of stock abundance and fishing intensity (e.g., marine reserves or maritime concessions versus open access areas). This includes the establishment of closed seasons as de facto management experiments, which proved useful in evaluating the capacity of passive restocking of depleted areas and for the quantification of population demographic features. The precise location of fishing grounds provided reliable area-specific estimates of population density and structure, catch, and fishing effort. This allowed the allocation of catch quotas in each fishing ground. We also discuss the reliability and applicability of spatially explicit management tools. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and Territorial User Rights in Fisheries (TURFs) fulfilled objectives for management and conservation and served as experimentation tools. The examples provided in our review include a comparative synthesis of the relative usefulness of alternative spatially explicit management tools under a framework of management redundancy. The cross-linkage between fishery experimental management protocols and the active participation of fishers is suggested as the strategy to be followed to improve the sustainable management of small-scale shellfisheries in Latin America. Finally, we discuss the future needs, challenges and issues that need to be addressed to improve the management status of the small-scale shellfisheries in Latin America, and, in general, around the world. We conclude that for the sustainability of shellfish resources there is an urgent need to look for linkages between sociology, biology and economics under an integrated management framework. Fishers, and not the shellfish, must be in the center of such a framework.",2001,,Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries,11,1,30-Jan,,10.1023/A:1014235924952,,#21481,Castilla 2001,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
A framework for incorporating stakeholder participation in marine resource management: A case study in Tobago,"Brown, K.; Adger, W.N.; Tompkins, E.; Bacon, P.; Shim, D.; Young, K.","This paper describes a method to enhance decision-making being developed and applied to marine and coastal resources. The approach combines stake-holder analysis and environmental valuation within a framework of multiple criteria analysis. It uses stakeholder participation in an iterative process to derive weights for economic, social and ecological criteria. It aims to develop a decision-making tool which enables different stakeholders' perspectives and values to be explicitly included in the analysis. This approach is developed within the context of a multiple use marine protected area, the Buccoo Reef Marine Park in Tobago, West Indies. Such resources are crucial both in terms of the close environmental interactions in coastal zones and in terms of their economic and recreational use linkages, particularly within small island developing countries. The model uses eight criteria which cover social, ecological and economic aspects. The economic criteria assessed are the contribution of tourism to the macro-economy of Trinidad and Tobago; and the consumer surplus associated with recreational use of the marine protected area. The social criteria are the jobs for Tobagon-ians in tourism; the number of people whose livelihoods depend on informal tourism-related activities; and local access to the marine park for extractive and recreational uses. The ecological criteria include indicators of mangrove productivity; sea grass distribution; and coral reef quality. These criteria are both quantitative and qualitative and are assessed using various primary data collection methods and models. Methods for estimation of these criteria under different development scenarios and their incorporation into the multi-criteria framework are outlined. Preliminary results demonstrate that there are evident trade-offs between the different criteria, and that different stakeholders rank or weight these criteria differently. However, involvement by stakeholders in the process of developing the model, and in discussing the recommendations derived from different weightings, provides an opportunity to explore and construct different develop-ment outcomes. This makes explicit the different perceptions and values of the different actors, which creates an opportunity for decision making and management based on consensus rather than conflict.

Linking small-scale fisheries co-management to U.N. Sustainable Development Goals,"Smallhorn-West, P.; Cohen, P.J.; Phillips, M.; Jupiter, S.D.; Govan, H.; Pressey, R.L.","Small-scale fisheries account for 90% of global fishers and 40% of the global catch. Effectively managing small-scale fisheries is, therefore, crucial to progressing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Co-management and community-based fisheries management are widely considered the most appropriate forms of governance for many small-scale fisheries. We outlined relationships between small-scale fisheries co-management and attainment of the SDGs, including evidence for impacts and gaps in dominant logic. We identified 11 targets across five SDGs to which small-scale fisheries co-management (including community-based fisheries management) can contribute; the theory of change by which these contributions could be achieved; and the strength of evidence for progress toward SDG targets related to various co-management strategies. Our theory of change links the 11 SDG targets by qualifying that progress toward some targets is contingent on others being achieved first. We then reviewed 58 case studies of co-management impacts from the Pacific Islands––a region rich in local marine governance––to evaluate evidence of where, to what degree, and with how much certainty different co-management strategies conferred positive impacts to each SDG target. These strategies included access restrictions, permanent area closures, periodic closures, and gear and species restrictions. Although many studies provide evidence linking multiple co-management strategies to improvements in resource status (SDG 14.4), there was limited evidence of follow-on effects, such as improvements in catch (SDG 2.3, 2.4), livelihoods (SDG 1.2), consumption (SDG 2.1), and nutrition (SDG 2.2). Our findings suggest that leaps of logic and assumptions are prevalent in co-management planning and evaluation. Hence, when evaluating co-management impacts against the SDGs, consideration of ultimate goals is required, otherwise, there is a risk of shortfalls between aspirations and impact. © 2022 The Authors.

A multilayered network analysis of social participation in the management of Marine Protected Areas in Brazil,"Olaya-Restrepo, J.; Schiavetti, A.; Barbeitos, M.S.","Effective implementation of Marine Protected Areas (MPA) networks depends on social participation into management. In this study, a multilayered network analysis was used to understand patterns of social participation in MPA management in Brazil. To this end, managers were invited to answer an online questionnaire about interaction with social actors in 7 management activities. Engagement in management activities was represented as interactions between social actors and MPAs. Different types of management activity were represented as separate layers. All responding MPAs (n = 22) reported interactions with social actors, resulting in a network with 141 nodes connected by 182 edges. Governmental Organizations (GO) prevailed in surveillance and formal training activities, research was dominated by universities, monitoring activities were shared mainly by universities and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and community groups only had strong participation in environmental education activities. The network had low “edge loss” resilience with dependency on the participation of social actors in the management councils to maintain its current levels of connectivity. GOs that have important roles in the protection of terrestrial ecosystems have a restricted impact as higher-level coordinators of MPAs activities. Thus, the capacity building falls mainly on individual MPAs. Management councils are supposed to be the “town halls” where the different social sectors come together to discuss environmental problems in Brazil. However, some constraints must still exist, since only 51 % of Brazilian MPAs have legally instituted their councils. We suggest that their effective implementation, as ordered by law, is the best starting point to improve the dismal situation of Brazilian MPAs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Marine Policy,146,,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2022.105329,,#21581,Olaya-Restrepo 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
"Understanding How Marine Protected Areas Influence Local Prosperity—A Case Study of Gili Matra, Indonesia","Rosadi, A.; Dargusch, P.; Taryono, T.","A Marine Protected Area (MPA) is always expected to create a specified outcome in ecosystem improvement. While they are certain to benefit marine life, MPAs also impact the surrounding communities, as they directly affect the livelihoods of people who rely on marine exploits to make a decent living. In other words, MPAs create new communal dynamics influencing the rate of prosperity in the surrounding communities. Unfortunately, the leverage of MPAs in the coastal communities’ social economy is often under-assessed in MPA-related research. The MPA’s influence on communal prosperity emphasizes the importance of policy incentives from stakeholders. Therefore, stakeholders’ perceptions of MPAs are fundamental in the planning and implementation of MPAs, which could improve the prosperity of the coastal communities. In Gili Matra, Indonesia, where tourism is the MPA’s backbone, MPAs are expected to sustain prosperity for future generations. However, some stakeholders with different influential stances to the MPA (Influential Stakeholders (IS) and Non-Influential Stakeholders (NIS)) demand a contradictive approach. This could lead to managerial issues for the MPAs.

Ten years of dynamic co-management of a multi-species reef fishery,"Smallhorn-West, P.; Cohen, P.J.; Kukiti, E.; Rabbitt, S.; Rikio, A.; Sori, F.; Tapala, S.; Warren, R.; Boso, D.; Foale, S.","Co-management, a governance process whereby management responsibility is shared between resource users and other collaborators, is a mainstream approach for governing social and ecological aspects of small-scale fisheries. While many assessments of co-management are available for single time periods, assessments across longer time-scales are rare–meaning the dynamic nature, and long-term outcomes, of co-management are insufficiently understood. In this study we analyse ten-years of catch and effort data from a co-managed, multi-species reef fishery in Solomon Islands. To further understand social, ecological and management dynamics we also draw on interviews with fishers and managers that had been conducted throughout the same decade. We aimed to answer (1) what are the temporal trends in fishing effort, harvesting efficiency, and catch composition within and beyond a periodically-harvested closure (i.e. a principal and preferred management tool in Pacific island reef fisheries), and, (2) what are the internal and external drivers that acted upon the fishery, and its management. Despite high fishing effort within the periodically-harvested closure, catch per unit effort remained stable throughout the ten years. Yet the taxonomic composition of catch changed substantially as species targeted early in the decade became locally depleted. These observations indicate that both the frequency of harvesting and the volumes harvested may have outpaced the turnover rates of target species. We argue that this reflects a form of hyperstability whereby declining abundance is not apparent through catch per unit effort since it is masked by a shift to alternate species. While the community sustained and adapted their management arrangements over the decade as a response to internal pressures and some signs of resource changes, some external social and ecological drivers were beyond their capabilities to govern. We argue the collaborative, knowledge exchange, and learning aspects of adaptive co-management may need even more attention to deal with this complexity, particularly as local and distal pressures on multi-species fisheries and community governance intensify.

Stakeholder Perceptions Can Distinguish ‘Paper Parks’ from Marine Protected Areas,"Relano, V.; Mak, T.; Ortiz, S.; Pauly, D.","While numerous Marine Protected Areas (MPA) have been created in the last decades, their effectiveness must be assessed in the context of the country’s biodiversity conservation policies and must be verified by local observations. Currently, the observations of local stakeholders, such as those from non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academics, government civil servants, journalists, and fishers, are not considered in any MPA database. The Sea Around Us has added observations from local stakeholders to address this gap, adding their perspectives to its reconstructed fisheries catch database, and to at least one MPA in each country’s Exclusive Economic Zone. It is important to pursue and incentivize stakeholder knowledge sharing to achieve a better understanding of the current level of marine protection, as this information is a valuable addition to the existing MPA databases. To address this gap, we demonstrated that personal emails containing a one-question questionnaire about the fishing levels in an MPA are an excellent way to gather data from local stakeholders, and that this works especially well for respondents in NGOs, academia, and governments. Of the stakeholders who replied to our personalized email, 66% provided us with the fishing level of the MPA that we asked for. The paper also presents how to access this information through the Sea Around Us website, which details in anonymized form the most common fishing levels for each selected MPA, as perceived or observed by different local stakeholder groups. This information is a unique and novel addition to a website that is concerned with marine conservation and contributes to a more accurate and inclusive discourse around MPAs. This information also helps to identify the gaps that need to be addressed to turn ‘paper parks’ (i.e., MPAs that are legally designated but not effective) into effective MPAs, which can contribute to climate-resilient ‘blue economies’. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,,Sustainability (Switzerland),14,15,,,10.3390/su14159655,,#21601,Relano 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
"Evaluating the effectiveness of three national marine protected areas in the Yangtze River Delta, China","Zeng, X.; Liang, J.; Zeng, J.; Chen, M.; Zeng, C.; Mazur, M.; Li, S.; Zhou, Z.; Ding, W.; Ding, P.; Cao, L.","China’s coastal areas face serious environmental degradation as a consequence of large-scale economic development. To balance environmental sustainability with economic development, China is currently implementing a strategy of ‘eco-civilization’, with marine protected areas (MPAs) expected to be one approach to achieving sustainable marine ecosystems. Since the 1990s, China has established over 270 MPAs, but their effectiveness remains unknown, particularly in the Yangtze River Delta. This study modified pre-existing frameworks to evaluate the effectiveness of three national MPAs in the Yangtze River Delta. The modified framework includes conservation outcomes and their potential drivers. Drivers consist of – attributes species or ecosystems within the MPA, attributes of the MPA, institutional design principles, and participation. Five scenarios were proposed based on score combinations of the four drivers: proactive, well designed, well governed, interactive, and learning. All three MPAs achieved a satisfactory level of outcomes and most of the drivers for all three MPAs achieved a satisfactory level. Two of the MPAs were categorized into the learning scenario, and the third into the well-designed scenario, indicating that there is still room to improve institutional design principles and public participation. We suggest developing cost and benefit indicators to more deeply understand proportionality among stakeholders. In addition, the role of participation should be clarified and promoted. We recommend regular environmental performance monitoring and assessment to identify problems and optimize management.

"The bridging role of non-governmental organizations in the planning, adoption, and management of the marine protected area network in Raja Ampat, Indonesia","White, C.M.; Mangubhai, S.; Rumetna, L.; Brooks, C.M.","Coral reef ecosystems are among the most diverse habitats on earth, providing essential social and ecological services. Raja Ampat, Indonesia - located in the Coral Triangle, the heart of marine biodiversity - has a rich history of traditional management, which included area-based management tools akin to modern marine protected areas (MPAs). Decentralization and restoration of tenure rights in 2001 provided an opportunity for resurgence and stronger recognition of these traditional systems. Conservation non-governmental organizations (NGOs), noting the remarkable biodiversity and increasing threats due to destructive fishing practices, worked with local communities to facilitate community-based MPAs as a conservation strategy. Here we employed a case study approach to assess the specific bridging strategies utilized by NGOs during the adoption, implementation and management of the Raja Ampat MPA Network. This descriptive case study included six targeted in-depth interviews and other secondary sources. Our results suggest that NGOs played different roles over time in the MPA process. Interviewees identified specific initiatives that occurred during this process, which involved multiple bridging tools. Three of these key initiatives are: the Tourism Entrance Fee System, the Raja Ampat MPA Patrol System, and the Blue Abadi Fund. The specific bridging tools employed included: linking stakeholders, co-producing knowledge, providing access to resources, facilitating community engagement, and building capacity. Recent research has pointed to social and ecological effectiveness of the Raja Ampat MPA Network, which could in part be attributed to the bottom-up approach facilitated by NGOs, including through bridging practices. However, we also note the limitations of this study in only providing an NGO-centric perspective which may be more nuanced if other stakeholder perspectives could have been obtained. © 2022 The Authors",2022,,Marine Policy,141,,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2022.105095,,#21605,White 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Local practice of marine protected areas legislation in China: The case of Zhoushan,"Yu, X.; Dong, Y.","Recognizing the ever-increasing importance of laws in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) construction and management, more and more countries have begun to seriously make MPA laws, from national to local. In China, as a new Protected Areas system with national parks as the mainstay is adopted, the establishment of a MPA legal system is put on the agenda. As the first and only local legislation for multiple-use MPAs in China, the Regulation on Management of Zhoushan National Special MPAs, together with three complementary Measures, has been implemented since 2017 and went through an amendment in 2021, thereby providing a rare opportunity to explore how the special characteristics of marine ecosystem might interact with the management and enforcement mechanisms. Based on the first-hand data collected from the process of post-legislative assessment and provision amendment, this article presents a thorough analysis of this local legislation and its implementation from seven aspects: managing agencies, division of responsibilities, law enforcement capabilities, subsistence and conservation, public participation, supporting infrastructure and innovation. In conclusion, this article offers important lessons for improving MPA governance through local legislation. They are (1) a more flexible model of “a basic law plus special laws” might better strengthen the managing agencies of MPAs by assigning them appropriate responsibilities and resources; (2) MPA planning should respect local subsistence and development so as to get citizens involved in marine conservation; (3) a successful innovation in local legislation must take enforceability, especially the supporting infrastructure in place, into consideration. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Marine Policy,141,,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2022.105084,,#21608,Yu 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,

Achieving and prioritizing shortlists of multidisciplinary indicators demands a significant effort from specialists to depict the multiple conservation and socioeconomic interests, and the large complexity of natural systems. The present paper describes a structured expert-based methodology (process and outputs) to co-define a list of multidisciplinary MPA performance indicators. This work was promoted by the management authority of coastal MPAs in mainland Portugal to gather a consensual and feasible list of indicators that would guide the design of a future national monitoring program. Hence, Portuguese coastal MPAs served as a case study to develop such a process between 2019 and 2020. In the end, participants (1) agreed on a shortlist of prioritized indicators (i.e., environmental, governance, and socioeconomic indicators) and (2) defined minimum monitoring frequencies for the indicators in this list, compatible with the potential replicability of the associated survey methods. The present approach recommends that management plans incorporate monitoring procedures and survey methods, with a validated list of indicators and associated monitoring periodicity, agreed among researchers, MPA managers and governance experts. The proposed methodology, and the lessons learned from it, can support future processes aiming to define and prioritize MPA performance indicators.

Marine Protected Areas Management in the Mediterranean Sea—The Case of Croatia,"Maestro, M.; Chica‐ruiz, J.A.; Perković, Z.P.; Pérez‐cayeiro, M.L.","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are widely used tools to conserve marine ecosystems and their services. They are complex socio‐ecological systems where human activities and nature inter-act. Croatia has 409 protected areas, of which 19 are coastal‐marine. The aim of this paper is to ana-lyze the management model of MPAs in Croatia and to identify their strengths and weaknesses. For this purpose, three MPAs have been chosen: Brijuni National Park, Telašćica Nature Park, and Pakleni Islands Significant Landscape. The methodology used assesses 26 specific indicators to an-alyze the status of 4 key factors: management body, planning subprocess, public participation, and implementation subprocess. The results of this evaluation are 5 possible scenarios: proactive (1), learning (2), interactive (3), centralized (4), and formal (5) management. The results show that Brijuni presents a proactive scenario (1), Telašćica an interactive scenario (3), and Pakleni Islands a centralized scenario (4). A series of measures are presented, which can improve the score. In general, MPA management in Croatia tends towards a proactive model, where the management body is its greatest strength. There is a shift from a top‐down to a bottom‐up approach, which implies a greater involvement of the population in decision‐making. However, public participation is not yet fully consolidated. © 2022 by the authors.

The benefits of multiuse PAs that elevate the role of IPLCs in management have long been recognized. However, quantitative examinations of how resource governance and the distribution of management rights affect conservation outcomes are vital for long-term sustainability. Here, we use a long-term, quasi-experimental monitoring dataset from four Indonesian marine PAs that demonstrates that multiuse PAs can increase fish biomass, but incorporating multiple governance principles into management regimes and enforcing rules equitably are critical to achieve ecological benefits. Furthermore, we show that PAs predicated primarily on enforcing penalties can be less effective than those where IPLCs have the capacity to engage in management. Our results suggest that well-governed multiuse PAs can achieve conservation objectives without undermining the rights of IPLCs.

It aimed to (1) To determine the profile of the stakeholders of the marine protected sanctuary; (2) evaluate the prevailing knowledge, attitude, and practices of stakeholders relative to the specific coastal and marine ecosystem. Whereas most of the respondents were knowledgeable that coral reef and seagrass affects fish productivity, whereas the mangrove forests and mudflats affect the source of food of various wildlife species. Additionally, they are also knowledgeable about ocean/marine pollution, climate change, biodiversity, and people's contribution to climate change. The result of the survey indicates that respondents living in the specific MPA vicinity were knowledgeable on the different environmental and resource issues. The respondents who participated in the survey have a positive attitude outlook towards their support on marine protected areas established in their locality or area of residency. On the practices on the marine protected area, respondents merely use tin cans, plastic straws, plastic bottles, and other plastic materials, directly harvesting fish for family sustenance, joining tree planting, and taking photos of natural scenery. Furthermore, they never throw garbage anywhere, but some of them are involved in cutting mangroves for charcoal production. © 2022 Public Recreation and Landscape Protection - With Environment Hand in Hand?

EVALUATION OF MARINE LITTER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN COASTS AND SEAS OF TURKEY,"Eyuboglu, O.; Eyuboglu, H.","The current study discussed marine waste management practices in Turkey in terms of legal and institutional frameworks. In addition, proposals have been made to assess issues regarding the marine litter in Turkey. The current state of data on the sources, causes, quantities, and distribution of marine litter at the regional level in Turkey is quite poor. However, it is clear that improved coordination of monitoring programs would benefit all. Wider sharing of the data produced should be essential. In Turkey, marine environmental monitoring is complex, since existing monitoring is divided between many ministries, universities, local governmental bodies, and NGOs. Some of the monitoring is routine and repeated on a regular basis, while other work is project-based, and thus it has limited sustainability. One of the key priority elements for a successful implementation of marine litter management is the establishment of an effective framework for coordination and cooperation among national, regional, and local authorities. © 2022, Scibulcom Ltd..

Use of management strategy evaluation to understand the value of citizen science in managing an iconic California recreational fishery,"Bellquist, L; Harford, WJ; Hurd, F; Jackson, A; Prince, JD; Freiwald, J; Neumann, A; Likins, J; Wilson, JR","Data-limited fisheries present significant challenges to fisheries management around the world. Landings data represent the simplest and most common source of fishery information, but length data of harvested species can offer particularly useful insight into the strength of fishing pressure and the status of stocks. However, unbiased length data can be difficult and costly to collect, which highlights a need for understanding the utility of non-conventional data collection programs, such as those generated by community members and citizen science programs to improve management decision-making. In this study, our objective was to understand the value of citizen science for management using the iconic California recreational red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) dive fishery. To accomplish this, we employed management strategy evaluation (MSE) to simulate this benthic invertebrate fishery that was sampled by two different fishery independent survey protocols: a community science survey program led by trained volunteers and a professional science survey program led by a state agency. We subjected the data to a range of uncertainties, by including time-varying life history parameters, environmental variability, and effective sample size scenarios, to understand the management level consequences of each survey methodology. Our results show that community science program data collection can serve as a high-quality data source, can be linked directly to fisheries management decisions via a Harvest Control Rule (HCR), and can be a useful information source even in the absence of conventional data sources. Our results are specific to the California red abalone fishery, but they also highlight the potential broader value of community science data collection programs for improving information content of small-scale and recreational fisheries.",2022,,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,278,,,WOS:000916297800002,10.1016/j.ecss.2022.108112,,#21645,Bellquist 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
Hawksbill presence and habitat suitability of a marine reserve in Honduras,"Wright, MK; Pompe, LR; Mishra, DR; Baumbach, DS; Salinas, L; Dunbar, SG","Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been established to decrease the negative impacts of human activities on important marine habitats. Several sea turtle species reside within MPAs; however, analyses of habitat suitability for sea turtles within many MPAs is typically lacking. Habitat modeling and species mapping have become essential tools in determining areas suitable for species inhabitance. MaxEnt is a popular machine-learning program that uses presence-only occurrence data and is considered the best modeling method in discriminating between suitable and unsuitable habitats. Using MaxEnt, we created species distribution models (SDMs) from presence-only occurrence points for juvenile hawksbills and three environmental variables: boat traffic intensities, prey item distributions, and benthic characterizations, within the Sandy Bay West End Marine Reserve (SBWEMR) in Roatan, Honduras. Area under the receiving operator curve (AUC) values were greater than 0.75, indicating high model accuracy. Jackknife evaluations indicated algal prey item Dictyota spp., boat traffic intensity, and Geodia neptuni sponge abundance had the greatest influence on species distribution. Areas of suitability shifted based on time of day and ranged from a low probability of hawksbill presence (0.0) to a high probability of hawksbill presence (0.8). Regardless of time of day, the SBWEMR is classified as at least moderately suitable (> 0.2-0.4), with least suitable habitat (0-0.2) prevalent in the most northeastern region of the reserve. The greatest suitability (> 0.6-1) was evident within the mid-region and southern most regions of the reserve. Probability of hawksbill presence increased in accordance with increasing boat traffic, although there was no clear causative relationship between the two. Although the reserve overall is mostly moderately suitable, the SBWEMR remains an important local recruitment and foraging ground for juvenile hawksbills. Hawksbills have been considered resilient, continually functioning beneath their operational limits. However, with continued global depletion of essential habitats over time and lack of effective MPA management, areas of habitat suitable for hawksbill inhabitance may decrease below levels sufficient for hawksbill presence in protected areas of the Western Caribbean.",2022,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,225,,,WOS:000806020300005,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106204,,#21674,Wright 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
The influence of El Nino Southern Oscillation on the population dynamics of oceanic manta rays in the Mexican Pacific,"Cabral, MMP; Stewart, JD; Marques, TA; Ketchum, JT; Ayala-Bocos, A; Hoyos-Padilla, EM; Reyes-Bonilla, H","Oceanic manta rays Mobula birostris are declining globally due to fisheries. Past work has shown that movements and distributions of oceanic manta ray populations are sensitive to climatic fluctuations such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation. The Revillagigedo National Park (RNP), Mexico, is a well-known aggregation site for oceanic manta rays. However, published baseline data on population structure and dynamics, and the influence of oceanographic variables on the abundance of oceanic manta rays in the region are lacking. We used 2015-2019 photo-identification data to describe baseline demographic characteristics of this population and to evaluate the influence of environmental factors on population dynamics. A significant sex bias was found with a female:male ratio of 1.4:1. Mark-recapture (MR) was used to estimate monthly abundance and provided the first superpopulation size estimate of 1172 (+/- 90), representing all individuals using the RNP during the survey period. The MR analysis suggests a significant relationship between the multivariate ENSO index and monthly survival probabilities, and chlorophyll-a as a driver of recruitment in surveyed dive sites.

Dynamics of human take and animal predation on sea turtle nests in Northwest Costa Rica,"Reavis, JL; Rojas-Canizales, D; Mejias-Balsalobre, C; Naranjo, I; Arauz, R; Senko, JF","Many conservation projects relocate sea turtle eggs to hatcheries to protect the sea turtle nests from the anthropogenic and natural threats they face in the early stages of development. The Rescue Center for Endangered Marine Species (CREMA) manages four sea turtle conservation projects on the nesting beaches of the Southern Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica, where the predominant nesting activity is from olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea). Two of these nesting projects are based in Costa de Oro and San Miguel, which are adjacent beaches divided by an estuary. In this study, we compared the dynamics and rates of human and animal predation of nests prior to being relocated to the hatchery on both nesting beaches from 2012 to 2018. We hypothesized that human take and animal predation were compensatory threats, meaning that lower human take may result in higher animal predation, and vice versa, resulting in a similar number of nests lost to predation overall. We discuss the community based conservation programs on both beaches, one of which has been monitored since 1998 (San Miguel) and the other of which has been monitored since 2012 (Costa de Oro). We found that Costa de Oro exhibited high rates of human take with up to 51% of nests being extracted per season, which has decreased since the conservation project was established. Human take was significantly higher than animal predation on both beaches and human take was significantly higher in Costa de Oro. While San Miguel exhibited higher animal predation, the difference was not statistically significant. Higher depredation by animals corresponded to higher overall nest abundance on both beaches. We were unable to find evidence that human take or animal predation increased in the absence of the other threat, suggesting a lack of compensatory effects of predation. Our findings support further analysis of animal predation and a continuation of patrol-based conservation efforts as well as community outreach to attempt to merge cultural values with sea turtle conservation.",2022,,PEERJ,10,,,WOS:000800121400001,10.7717/peerj.12925,,#21702,Reavis 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,
