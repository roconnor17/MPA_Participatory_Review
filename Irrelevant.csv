Blue carbon in area-based coastal and marine management schemes - a review,"Moraes, O","Blue carbon ecosystems are diverse and highly productive coastal habitats (mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes) that sequester large quantities of carbon and provide a suite of important ecosystem services (co-benefits') for humans and the environment. These ecosystems are being threatened globally due to land-use change driven by expanding agriculture, aquaculture, coastal development, and pollution. Climatic impacts further threaten the resilience, functionality, and adaptability of blue carbon ecosystems. Marine protected areas' (MPAs) provide a statutory approach for protecting coastal and marine ecosystems, yet are unlikely to meet additionality' requirements. Whereas other effective conservation measures (OECMs) including community-based locally managed marine areas' (LMMAs) provide opportunities to enhance blue carbon conservation and restoration efforts. LMMAs likely deliver additional sequestration, although ensuring permanence' of carbon stocks may be more difficult to achieve. This review summarizes key approaches of blue carbon monitoring; governance systems; policy instruments; and investment pathways for conservation and restoration.",2019,,JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN OCEAN REGION,15,2,193-212,WOS:000478101200006,10.1080/19480881.2019.1608672,,#19183,Moraes 2019,,
Exploring Social Resilience in Madagascar's Marine Protected Areas,"Cinner, J; Fuentes, MMPB; Randriamahazo, H","We examined and compared aspects of local-level resilience in 13 coastal communities within and adjacent to all of Madagascar's national marine protected areas. Our examination of social resilience focused on indicators of the flexibility of household livelihood portfolios and both formal and informal governance institutions, the capacity of communities to organize, their capacity to learn, and access to household assets and community infrastructure. In general, we found high levels of flexibility in formal institutions and livelihood portfolios and high levels of participation in decision-making and community groups. Together, these indicators suggest some latent capacity to adaptively manage resources, but this capacity may be offset by poor levels of trust between communities and resource managers, a poor understanding of the ways in which humans affect marine resources, inadequate feedback of ecological monitoring to communities, inflexibility in informal governance institutions, and a lack of assets to draw upon. We suggest that building desirable resilience in Madagascar's marine protected areas will require the following: investments in community-level infrastructure, projects to generate household income, and enhanced agricultural production to improve the well-being of communities; improvements in the capacity to learn through investments in formal and informal education; enhanced trust between park staff and local communities; empowerment of communities to govern and enforce natural resources; the increased accountability of leaders and transparency of governance processes; adequate cross-scale interaction with local, provincial, and national institutions; and the pursuit of these activities in ways that capitalize on community-specific strengths, such as high flexibility and the presence of sociocultural institutions such as taboos that regulate resource use.",2009,,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,14,1,,WOS:000267846300030,,,#19188,Cinner 2009,,
Understanding and valuing conflicts in marine protected areas: The best way to develop innovations?,"Beuret, JE; Cadoret, A; Pothin, K; Barnay, AS; Le Bihan, O; Sevin Allouet, MA","Marine protected areas face numerous conflicts associated with the implementation of conservation measures. These conflicts generate costs, prevent progress, make cooperation between stakeholders difficult and create risks of ineffectiveness. Although they are often concealed or circumvented, they also offer opportunities for new connections and collective innovation. Rather than leaving them to these kinds of avoidance strategies, conflicts were the subject of a Knowledge Cafe event at the Fourth International Marine Protected Area Congress to compare the perspectives of managers, decision-makers and scientists on dealing with conflict. This contribution presents the conceptual framework for discussions during and after the Fourth International Marine Protected Area Congress and the operational and research avenues they open up. Cross-referencing the results of this collective approach and research contributions makes it possible to characterize the diversity and complexity of conflicts in marine protected areas and the driving forces behind them and analyse resolution strategies. Instead of avoidance strategies, the causes and consequences of the idea of understanding and valuing conflicts is explored, along with operational approaches to achieving this.",2019,,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,29,,212-222,WOS:000491946500018,10.1002/aqc.3070,,#19190,Beuret 2019,,
Science Diplomacy: Strategic Initiative to Create a Buffer Zone in the Caribbean Colombian Marine Protected Area Seaflower,"Ramirez-Cabrales, F; Forero, SIR","It recognized the science diplomacy as a path to address national and common interest related to marine spaces declared as human heritage areas.

The Specially Protected Areas And Wildlife to the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (SPAW) Protocol is the main instrument to evaluate the possible course of action that allows us to propose the implementation of this initiative. To do so, it is necessary to consider aspects as sovereignty and maritime jurisdiction of state parties and non-state parties. Besides, are considered threats related to maritime transport. It analyzed the geographical conditions and the managerial institutions and stakeholders that participate in the management.

"Science, Policy Advocacy, and Marine Protected Areas","Gray, NJ; Campbell, LM","Much has been written in recent years regarding whether and to what extent scientists should engage in the policy process, and the focus has been primarily on the issue of advocacy. Despite extensive theoretical discussions, little has been done to study attitudes toward and consequences of such advocacy in particular cases. We assessed attitudes toward science and policy advocacy in the case of marine protected areas (MPAs) on the basis of a survey of delegates at the First International Marine Protected Areas Congress. Delegates were all members of the international marine conservation community and represented academic, government, and nongovernmental organizations. A majority of respondents believed science is objective but only a minority believed that values can be eliminated from science. Respondents showed only partial support of positivist principles of science. Almost all respondents supported scientists being integrated into MPA policy making, whereas half of the respondents agreed that scientists should actively advocate for particular MPA policies. Scientists with a positivist view of science supported a minimal role for scientists in policy, whereas government staff with positivist beliefs supported an advocacy or decision-making role for scientists. Policy-making processes for MPAs need to account for these divergent attitudes toward science and advocacy if science-driven and participatory approaches are to be reconciled.",2009,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,23,2,460-468,WOS:000264272000030,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01093.x,,#19195,Gray 2009,,REVIEW ARTICLE
"Building trust among marine protected area managers and community members through scientific research: Insights from the Ningaloo Marine Park, Australia","Cvitanovic, C; van Putten, EI; Hobday, AJ; Mackay, M; Kelly, R; McDonald, J; Waples, K; Barnes, P","The success of participatory marine governance arrangements is influenced by the levels of trust that exist between decision-makers and diverse stakeholder groups within the community. While the benefits of high levels of trust among these groups is well established, specific approaches to building trust remain largely unknown. The aim of this study is to understand the extent to which scientific research programs can enhance trust among marine protected area (MPA) managers and community members via an evaluation of the Ningaloo Research Program - a large-scale program of marine research in the Ningaloo Marine Park. Results from a survey of 125 local residents show that community members along the Ningaloo coast believe that scientific research is important for the management of the marine park, and strongly support government investment in scientific research in the region. Results also suggest that science undertaken through the Ningaloo Research Program has increased the extent to which community members trust local managers, which study participants believe has led to improved social and environmental outcomes in the region. Finally, additional opportunities are identified to maintain and further enhance trust between community members and MPA managers, via targeted communication and engagement programs that account for different personality 'types'. In particular, the establishment of citizen science programs might further build trust. These results suggest that scientific research could be used as a means to increase trust among decision-makers and community members when coupled with an effective communication and outreach program, thus enhancing the success of participatory marine governance arrangements.",2018,,MARINE POLICY,93,,195-206,WOS:000434752900023,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.04.010,,#19196,Cvitanovic 2018,,
"Development of an environmental performance indicator framework to evaluate management effectiveness for Jiaozhou Bay Coastal Wetland Special Marine Protected Area, Qingdao, China","Wu, W; Yan, SQ; Feng, RY; Song, DH; Chen, XX","The management effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) has gained more and more attentions with an increasing research interest worldwide. An Environmental Performance Indicator (EPI) framework is considered to be a good means for MPAs' management planning and assessment. As a peculiar type of MPAs with Chinese characteristics, Special Marine Protected Area (SMPA) is still at an imperfect stage in terms of its operation and management in China. There is a scarcity of research evidence of SMPAs' management and its effectiveness evaluation as well. Focusing on this relatively new research field, this paper aims to establish a conceptual model and an operable EPI framework for examining SMPA's day-to-day management and evaluating its management effects, using Jiaozhou Bay Coastal Wetland SMPA (JZBCWSMPA), the first SMPA of Qingdao, as a case study. The evaluation model and indicator framework are developed via a comprehensive approach taking basic management ideas, international well-known model, widely used indicator frameworks and specific features of the study area into consideration. An expert ranking procedure is also conducted to aggregate the initial indicators. The innovative features of this framework are described, such as it is not only a systematic framework incorporating various kinds of indicators but also specifically practicable for the study area. It is expected that the research outcomes will provide technical supports for JZBCWSMPA's management effectiveness evaluation (MEE) and scientific references for decision-making and guiding for Qingdao's social economic sustainable development.

Adaptive Comanagement of a Marine Protected Area Network in Fiji,"Weeks, R; Jupiter, SD","Adaptive management of natural resources is an iterative process of decision making whereby management strategies are progressively changed or adjusted in response to new information. Despite an increasing focus on the need for adaptive conservation strategies, there remain few applied examples. We describe the 9-year process of adaptive comanagement of a marine protected area network in Kubulau District, Fiji. In 2011, a review of protected area boundaries and management rules was motivated by the need to enhance management effectiveness and the desire to improve resilience to climate change. Through a series of consultations, with the Wildlife Conservation Society providing scientific input to community decision making, the network of marine protected areas was reconfigured so as to maximize resilience and compliance. Factors identified as contributing to this outcome include well-defined resource-access rights; community respect for a flexible system of customary governance; long-term commitment and presence of comanagement partners; supportive policy environment for comanagement; synthesis of traditional management approaches with systematic monitoring; and district-wide coordination, which provided a broader spatial context for adaptive-management decision making.",2013,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,27,6,1234-1244,WOS:000327564300012,10.1111/cobi.12153,,#19198,Weeks 2013,,
A governance analysis of Guatemala's first recognized marine protected area: The Wildlife Refuge of Punta de Manabique (RVSPM),"Gonzalez-Bernat, MJ; Clifton, J","This paper examines governance effectiveness of the Wildlife Refuge of Punta de Manabique (RVSPM), the first recognized marine protected area in Guatemala. The analysis follows the Marine Protected Area Governance (MPAG) empirical framework through the use of incentives (economic, interpretative, knowledge, legal and participative) that evaluate the effectiveness of governance. Our results highlight that strategic alliances between some local communities and NGOs have successfully provided economic and participatory incentives for better management. However, efforts to develop an integrated or collaborative management system that promotes sustainable resource use across all stakeholder groups have failed. As a result, environmental degradation is increasing at an alarming rate, set against a backdrop of declining management effectiveness. Under this scenario, future prospects for governance should revise participatory incentives and strengthen legal incentives, which should be backed by strong political will. In addition, efforts should continue to foster opportunities for regional collaborations as an essential element for improved governance of the RVSPM and as a foundation to effectively manage natural and cultural resources in the wider Mesoamerican Reef region.",2021,,MARINE POLICY,127,,,WOS:000663338000007,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103626,,#19199,Gonzalez-Bernat 2021,,

California dreaming: Challenges posed by transposing science-based marine protected area planning processes in different political contexts,"De Santo, EM","In response to direct and indirect pressures on the marine environment posed by increased development and climate change, the international community has been planning and implementing networks of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in national waters. This paper critically assesses the role of evidence in marine conservation planning in the United Kingdom (UK), a process that drew heavily on the example set by California's Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) planning process. Whereas a science advisory panel played a constructive role and facilitated MPA planning in the Californian context, the outcome in the UK was quite different; evidence became a sticking point hampering the process. The actual designation of sites in the UK has been slower than expected, and none of the Reference Areas (i.e., no-take MPAs) proposed by stakeholder-led consultations have been implemented. Drawing on interviews with participants in the UK process and on theoretical debates surrounding evidence-based decision-making, this paper provides recommendations for effective science-driven marine conservation.",2017,,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY,75,,38-46,WOS:000407869500005,10.1016/j.envsci.2017.05.012,,#19206,DeSanto 2017,,
Environmental and human impacts on coastal and marine protected areas in India,"Krishnamoorthy, R; Devasenapathy, J; Thanikachalam, M; Ramachandran, S","The Indian coastline is about 7500 km in length and many ecologically sensitive coastal areas were declared as protected areas (marine biosphere reserves, national parks, wild life sanctuaries, reserve forests, Ramsar sites, etc). Based on the analysis of multidate remote sensing satellite data, the degradation sites within the protected areas have been identified. The study revealed that the remote sensing and GIS technology tools are more suitable to map and monitor the natural resources especially the mangroves and coral reefs in coastal and marine protected areas with reasonable accuracy in a most cost-effective way.

Establishing marine protected areas through bottom-up processes: insights from two contrasting initiatives in Chile,"Oyanedel, R; Marin, A; Castilla, JC; Gelcich, S","1. Bottom-up participatory processes to create and manage no-take marine protected areas have been proposed as a way to scale-up marine conservation and deal with the lack of support and compliance of top-down conservation approaches. However, bottom-up conservation does not always lead to positive outcomes, thus it is increasingly important to understand the conditions that determine the establishment and implementation of these initiatives. 2. Establishment and implementation processes were compared empirically for two contrasting bottom-up no-take marine protected areas that have been developing under the same political setting, however, one has been successful and the other has stalled. 3. Using mixed methods, stakeholders' (a) motivations to participate in the no-take marine protected area initiatives, (b) communication, support and information flow networks, (c) perceived participation, and (d) satisfaction with the establishment process of the bottom-up no-take marine protected areas, were assessed. 4. Non-significant differences were found between the two initiatives in terms of stakeholders' motivations to create a no-take marine protected area. 5. Significant differences were found in stakeholders' communication, support and information flow networks, in addition to differences in participation, and satisfaction with the establishment and implementation process. 7. Results highlight that for the implementation and consolidation of bottom-up no-take marine protected areas initiatives, common interests do not necessarily lead to common action, partnerships will not emerge automatically in response to potential benefits. 7. Understanding disparities in participation, information sharing and communication are key aspects which must be considered for creating and supporting successful marine protected areas based on bottom-up participatory processes.

Social Dimensions in Designing and Managing Marine Protected Areas in Bangladesh,"Islam, MM","This study assesses the governance challenges faced by two different types of aquatic protected areas in Bangladesh for fish stocks and elasmobranch and cetacean species. Establishing a network of sanctuaries across six riverine and estuarine zones has yielded positive ecological outcomes in the revitalization of hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) fisheries. The combination of firm political commitment, a meaningful partnership among various government agencies toward more vigorous enforcement, and a compensation scheme has contributed to this success. However, less attention has been given to the sanctuaries' social outcomes leading to underperformance in effectiveness and social equity. The drivers of ecological outcomes for hilsa shad sanctuaries may also be useful for marine megafauna conservation. In addition, fishers' needs, and participation should be considered when developing a management plan for marine protected areas (MPAs). Finally, I argue that to achieve Aichi Target 11 and SDG14 goals, expanding the MPAs' spatial coverage in Bangladesh should be coupled with ensuring effectiveness and social equity.",2021,,HUMAN ECOLOGY,49,2,171-185,WOS:000622650900001,10.1007/s10745-021-00218-z,,#19211,Islam 2021,,
"Overcoming Governance and Institutional Barriers to Integrated Coastal Zone, Marine Protected Area, and Tourism Management in Sri Lanka","Powell, RB; Cuschnir, A; Peiris, P","One of the major barriers to addressing complex social-ecological issues through integrated coastal management (ICM) is a lack of intergovernmental coordination and cooperation (horizontal and vertical fragmentation). This article describes an effort to overcome the barriers to ICM in Sri Lanka by fostering intergovernmental collaboration and initiating adaptive governance to restore one town, Hikkaduwa, and its associated marine protected area (MPA) and coastal zone habitats. Administrators from 12 national and local governmental agencies that are responsible for aspects of coastal management in the town of Hikkaduwa participated in a series of formal and informal workshops and a week-long tour of ICM projects in the Philippines. Outcomes demonstrate that these informal and formal meetings, workshops, and travel experiences fostered trust, social capital, and attitudinal organizational commitment (AOC). The experiences motivated members to overcome vertical and horizontal governance fragmentation through the formation of an independent intergovernmental committee for the restoration of Hikkaduwa into a sustainable and resilient community. ICM activities undertaken by the newly formed organization suggest that internal leadership capacity, effective local-national partnerships, explicitly linked ecological-economic projects, and long-term commitment are necessary conditions for success.

"""Bottom-up management approach to coastal marine protected areas in Portugal""","Ferreira, A; Seixas, S; Marques, JC","The classification and management of coastal marine protected areas is traditionally implemented without a strong public participation process in its early stage, resulting in conflicts. A bottom-up approach with public participation before defining regulations is an innovative, yet difficult process. The case study presented is a local experience of Avencas Biophysical Interest Zone in Cascais, Portugal. The objective of this paper is to evaluate a new approach, to assess the success of the management action applied in terms of the short-term response from users of the costal marine protected area.Public participation assemblies were conducted to welcome input from the fishing community regarding the new regulation; visual census and interviews directed at different users, were used to assess the short-term effectiveness of the implemented management actions. A new regulation is underway and user management actions have been implemented: visitors' pathways through the rocky platforms and information spots at the entrance to the beach.Positive results point to the success of this approach, as visitors either agreed or respected the various management actions implemented: 84% of them agree with information spots, and 76% agree with the pathways. Recreational fishers are now mostly located outside the protected area, though there are still some who choose to stay inside, which indicates the need to change some points in the regulation, to improve its compliance by the fishing community. The short-term evaluation methodology was effective in detecting changes in usage patterns from users when the bottom-up approach was applied. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of marine protected area management: The Marine Park of the Azores (Portugal),"Maestro, M; Chica-Ruiz, JA; Perez-Cayeiro, ML","A significant number of declared marine protected areas (MPAs) lack management plans, or they are not being applied appropriately, leading to poor management and, in the worst case scenario, so-called ""paper parks"". Evaluating the management of an MPA helps detect strengths and weaknesses, make decisions and correct mistakes in the future. Unfortunately, few evaluations have been done. In recent decades, management has gone from a traditional governance system to a more inclusive and participatory one that seeks to understand and integrate the interests and needs of all parties. Social actors are participating more actively in decision-making, and their support is fundamental for the success of an MPA. This study analyses the management of the Marine Park of the Azores (Portugal), one of the most emblematic areas of the European Union (EU). For this purpose, a methodology has been developed to evaluate the management of MPAs. It is based on the analysis of four key aspects: managing body, planning, public participation and implementation. For each one, specific indicators have been designed, resulting in five possible scenarios being proposed where priority is given to one or other factors, where each one has consequences on the biophysical and socioeconomic systems of the MPA. These scenarios are defined as: proactive, consultative, centralized, by learning and formal management. The results demonstrate that the Marine Park of the Azores is currently under centralized management, with a sound management body, but yet should be consolidates the process of planning and public participation.",2020,,MARINE POLICY,119,,,WOS:000564689000001,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104104,,#19217,Maestro 2020,,
Marine protected areas and human well-being - A systematic review and recommendations,"Rasheed, AR","This paper reviews literature relating to Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and human well-being. It finds that explicit studies on human well-being from MPAs are limited and empirical studies quantifying these relationships are rare. Most MPA papers, including those examining MPA effectiveness, focus on just a few aspects of well-being in the context of a sub-set of stakeholders, and consider only a single type of MPA. They mostly focus on conventional objective measures that are not comprehensive or systematically selected. This review argues for a systematic and integrative framework to ensure future MPA assessments are equipped to capture MPAs' contributions to human well-being more adequately and comprehensively. Such a framework can also allow for cross-MPA comparisons that can capture differences in well-being across different types of MPAs, and information gained can be useful for MPA practitioners and policy makers, particularly in reaching current global targets, such as the CBD, Aichi Target 11.",2020,,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES,41,,,WOS:000509730300008,10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.101048,,#19218,Rasheed 2020,,
"Marine systematic conservation planning for Rodrigues Island, western Indian Ocean","Pasnin, O; Attwood, C; Klaus, R","There is a growing number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that have been selected and designed through participatory processes, following the recognition of the need to increase the involvement of local communities likely to be affected by such developments. In parallel with this shift has been the development of systematic conservation planning (SCP) tools that have increased our capacity to design MPAs to maximise biodiversity outcomes and to scale-up community-based initiatives into more comprehensive MPA networks. In Rodrigues, four Marine Reserves (no-take zones) in the north of the island were identified through participatory processes. A Marine Protected Area (multi-use), South East Marine Protected Area (SEMPA), has also been gazetted in the south of the island through a community based approach. In order to verify and assess gaps in the stakeholder-based design, a Marine Reserve network was designed using the SCP tool Marxan using available spatial data on marine biotopes and fishing effort (FE) to achieve fisheries benefits and marine biodiversity protection. The Marxan analysis identified that only two of the four marine reserves achieve partly the objectives set and SEMPA contains planning units which can be considered as no take zones. This study shows the importance of using both stakeholder's knowledge and scientific input for a better design of MPAs. The results from the analyses can be used by decision makers to inform decisions in a scientific way by providing a set of scenarios from the Marxan analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Marine Protected Areas in Fiji: a critical assessment of 'Community Fisheries Management and Development Plans' as a mechanism for formalising customary MPAs, in particular LMMAs","Long, E","Fiji's National Government has committed to using Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to protect its marine environment. As Fiji is in the process of reforming its marine law, now is an opportune time to develop statutory mechanisms for establishing and regulating MPAs. This article considers the regulation of MPAs in Fiji's coastal waters-where the intersection of statutory and customary law poses particular challenges. 'Customary MPAs' already exist in Fiji's coastal environments, taking the form of tabu areas and 'Locally Managed Marine Areas' (LMMAs). Both of these are important mechanisms that any new statutory framework should incorporate and strengthen. In 2010, the draft Inshore Fisheries Decree (draft Inshore Decree) was prepared. Although the draft Inshore Decree appears to have stalled, it may yet be progressed to a final bill. Alternatively, some of the measures in it may be incorporated into another law. This article assesses one mechanism in the draft Inshore Decree that could be used to formalize customary MPAs-Community Fisheries Management and Development Plans (CFMDPs). It finds that CFMDPs demonstrate a number of strengths, in particular by supporting legal recognition of existing marine management measures. However, there are also weaknesses. Nevertheless, with refinement CFMDPs may be a useful tool for regulating Fiji's coastal MPAs.",2018,,ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW,21,2,81-100,WOS:000450938500002,10.4337/apjel.2018.02.01,,#19220,Long 2018,,
Marine ecotourism for small pelagics as a source of alternative income generating activities to fisheries in a tropical community,"Cusack, C; Sethi, SA; Rice, AN; Warren, JD; Fujita, R; Ingles, J; Flores, J; Garchitorena, E; Mesa, SV","Widespread overharvest has led to marine ecosystem degradation and declining fishery catches in many tropical communities. To allow stocks to recover and provide increased flows of food and income, reductions in fishing effort are necessary. The development of Alternative Income Generating Activities can help to reduce the economic reliance of coastal communities on fishing, potentially reducing pressure on fish stocks. Here we assess the local conditions which have enabled the creation of Alternative Income Generating Activities to fishing based on marine ecotourism in Moalboal, Philippines. Importantly, while marine ecotourism typically centers around charismatic megafauna, a combination of nearshore fringing reefs, the establishment of nearshore marine protected areas and the occurrence of a consistently large herring aggregation provide a large tourism draw to this community. Using a combination of regional and local economic statistics and stakeholder surveys, we implement an economic valuation of Moalboal marine ecotourism for 2018 and compare this valuation to an independent estimate of the extractive value of the herring aggregation. The Moalboal case indicates that a combination of strong community engagement in the governance of the ecotourism resource, a network of locally managed marine protected areas and the retention and distribution of economic benefits within the local community have led to a significant marine ecotourism sector. We contextualize these conditions into a set of potential enabling conditions for marine ecotourism as an Alternative Income Generating Activity to fishing to contribute insights to diversifying livelihood opportunities beyond extractive fishing for coastal communities in the tropics.",2021,,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,261,,,WOS:000691802300013,10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109242,,#19221,Cusack 2021,,
A framework to assess the vulnerability of California commercial sea urchin fishermen to the impact of MPAs under climate change,"Chen, C; Lopez-Carr, D; Walker, BLE","This paper describes the development of a Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) that estimates the relative ability of California commercial sea urchin fishermen to cope with the change associated with proposed marine protected areas. A key goal in establishing marine protected areas is to maximize conservation benefits while minimizing the potential negative impacts to local fishing communities. However, current impact analyses largely assume a linear relationship between percent of fishing area or revenue lost with the magnitude of impact to fishermen. The LVI described in this paper aims to provide an additional dimension to impact analyses in which the adaptive capacity of individual fishermen is examined to estimate the differential abilities of fishermen to cope with the loss of fishing areas or revenue. This paper advances vulnerability assessments as it develops a novel framework for identifying and measuring drivers of vulnerability for understudied fishing populations whose livelihoods depend upon marine resources. This vulnerability assessment is intended to inform the design of marine protected areas by enabling researchers to incorporate the adaptive capacity of fishermen into socioeconomic impact analyses. The LVI was developed for the California commercial sea urchin fishery in the context of proposed marine protected area networks develop through the California Marine Life Protected Act planning process. As climate change advances there is an increasing need to identify vulnerable and resilient populations and ways to bolster adaptive capacity given the environmental and economic changes ahead.",2014,,GEOJOURNAL,79,6,755-773,WOS:000210542500007,10.1007/s10708-014-9543-0,,#19222,Chen 2014,,
Low-quality management of Marine Protected Areas in the North-East Atlantic,"Alvarez-Fernandez, I; Freire, J; Sanchez-Carnero, N","The effectiveness of a marine protected area (MPA) requires adequate management plans (MgPs), good management performance and effective governance. This study diagnosed management quality on 126 MPAs and 57 MgPs in four countries in the NE Atlantic Ocean (France, England, Spain and Portugal) by adapting the MPA Management Effectiveness Assessment Tool to assess management quality, and management effort, strengths and weaknesses. Despite the fact that these MPAs were, in 2013, on average 14-year old, fewer than 30% showed sufficient management capacity, 18% showed operational management, and only 3% showed effective management. Therefore, 70% could be considered unmanaged or ""paper"" reserves. Among their strengths, MPAs were in general well legislated in the four countries and had operational management bodies in France and England.

Evaluating the effectiveness of management of the Malindi-Watamu marine protected area complex in Kenya,"Muthiga, NA","An assessment of management effectiveness of Kenya's oldest marine protected areas (Malindi and Watamu) was conducted within the framework of a regional assessment in Kenya, Seychelles and Tanzania. Biophysical, socio-economic and governance indicators were used to assess the delivery of MPA management objectives. Results indicate that the Malindi and Watamu marine parks that are no-take areas are making progress towards meeting their stated objective of biodiversity conservation. The 1997-1998 ENSO related bleaching event caused the greatest single measurable impact on the coral reefs of the marine parks leading to very high levels of coral mortality. The marine reserve where fishing is regulated was less effective in meeting its objective of sustaining community livelihoods. The weakest trends were related to the development of governance structures. A combination of management inefficiencies due to overlapping mandates, financial and administrative constraints, and inadequate stakeholder participation interacted to reduce the ability of the MPAs to fully achieve their objectives.

An evolving protocol to identify key stakeholder-influenced indicators of coastal change: the case of Marine Protected Areas,"Vella, P; Bowen, RE; Frankic, A","In recent years, there has been a growing realization of the need to protect and conserve degrading environments. This can only be achieved through integrated management of environmental protection and the rational use of living and non-living resources. However, no management plan that aims at sustainable development can be successful unless the human factor is included. The concept of ecosystem-based management considers socio-economic issues in evaluating management effectiveness. In this paper, we present a method for selecting and prioritizing socio-economic indicators, using a bottom-up approach involving stakeholder input. This technique is developed further to measure the effectiveness of integrated coastal management, using a Marine Protected Area (MPA) as an example. Stakeholder input is essential at an early stage to ensure MPA management success, providing the opportunity to include public participation and ensure community support.

Pragmatic approaches for effective management of pelagic marine protected areas,"Maxwell, SM; Ban, NC; Morgan, LE","The dynamic nature of pelagic environments presents unique challenges for management. Despite the sharp increase in the number of marine protected areas (MPAs) with large pelagic areas, or pelagic marine protected areas (PMPAs), little literature exists regarding on-the-ground approaches to their management, in large part due to the relative newness of many large-scale PMPAs. Here we attempt to highlight pragmatic solutions or recommendations for the management challenges of PMPAs, particularly regarding setting objectives, monitoring and compliance, drawing from examples of existing PMPA management when possible. We suggest using techniques such as structured decision making and multi-criteria decision analysis for setting management objectives and actions and reducing conflict that will be inherent across the multi-agency, multi-objective landscape of PMPAs. We suggest cost-effective strategies for monitoring of complex pelagic interactions and far-ranging species, including tiers of monitoring importance linked to funding levels, and highlight means of determining when monitoring is a necessity. Finally, we highlight techniques to increase compliance within PMPAs, such as participatory monitoring. We focus on enforcement across the large scales of PMPAs, such as setting and effectively integrating biological and enforcement priorities, and implementing cost-effective enforcement, particularly in remote regions, using techniques such as international enforcement partnerships and enforcement technologies. Our goal is not to give a complete framework for PMPA management, but to collate existing lessons and provide a baseline for managers to build from, and to provide insight for scientists looking to focus research efforts to aid in management of protected pelagic ecosystems.",2014,,ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH,26,1,59-74,WOS:000346425100005,10.3354/esr00617,,#19231,Maxwell 2014,,
Sharing goals by timely communication improves fishermen's satisfaction with marine protected areas: A case study in the Mediterranean,"Perea-Munoz, JM; Miles, A; Bayle-Sempere, JT","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are considered as a valid tool for mitigating the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems. Their success depends upon their acceptance by implicated stakeholders and on the integration of the stakeholder groups into their management. This integration is especially important with regard to fishermen, whose interests are the most directly affected by MPAs. The relational coordination method posits that effective communication and supportive relationships among stakeholders result in positive stakeholder behaviors and a more effective management of the system. Applying its principles, we designed a survey to evaluate the satisfaction of fishermen associated with five MPAs in the Spanish Mediterranean and determine what mechanisms affect fishermen's acceptance of MPAs. Our results demonstrate that effective communication is particularly important for good supportive relationships and satisfaction among fishermen and other stakeholder groups, as well as satisfaction with the MPA. Sharing objectives with fishermen through timely communication is the primary mechanism to improve fishermen's satisfaction and ameliorate perceptions towards MPA. To address this issue, we recommend more substantial integration of fishermen in the co-management of MPAs.",2022,,AMBIO,51,6,1520-1534,WOS:000739735400001,10.1007/s13280-021-01683-y,,#19232,Perea-Munoz 2022,,
Establishing a marine conservation baseline for the insular Caribbean,"Knowles, JE; Doyle, E; Schill, SR; Roth, LM; Milam, A; Raber, GT","Marine protected areas are a primary strategy for the conservation of marine habitats and species across the globe. In small island developing states, they often exceed their terrestrial counterparts in both number and area. To assess their effectiveness as a conservation measure over time, the accurate and up-to-date representation of marine protected areas through spatial and tabular data is imperative in order to establish baselines. Various regional and global agreements have set specific protection targets and these require spatial reporting on protected areas as an indicator of progress. For the insular Caribbean region, this study considers progress towards global Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity which is to conserve at least 10% of coastal and marine areas, and progress towards the regional target of the Caribbean Challenge Initiative (CCI) to protect ""at least 20% of nearshore marine and coastal habitats"", both aiming for a 2020 deadline. Progress towards these targets differs widely depending on the accuracy of the clatasets and the methods used. In an effort to update the current baseline of protection within the insular Caribbean, multiple governments, the Nature Conservancy and the Caribbean Marine Protected Area Management Network and Forum collaborated to develop a single insular Caribbean protected area dataset with accurate boundary information and the best available ecoregional and political boundaries. This study represents the most in-depth and spatially accurate effort to date to determine marine protected area coverage in the insular Caribbean. It is found that some form of marine management has been designated for around 7.1% of our study area in the insular Caribbean; progress towards Aichi Target 11 averaged among sovereign states within the insular Caribbean stands at approximately 3.25% and only three of the 10 participating governments in the CCI have reached their 20% target. Ocean protection was further assessed across the 25 governments and the three marine ecoregions by four different marine zones. Recommendations are made on regional to global cooperation for data sharing and reporting on indicators, highlighting possible directions to fill marine conservation gaps in the insular Caribbean.

Performance of community-based coastal resource management (CBCRM) programs in the Philippines: A meta-analysis,"Maliao, RJ; Pomeroy, RS; Turingan, RG","Community-based coastal resource management (CBCRM) is a major conservation and fisheries management strategy in the tropics. In this study, the performance of 16 CBCRM programs in the Philippines was assessed using a meta-analysis of eight indicators that represented the perceptions of local resource users. Overall, the CBCRM programs in the Philippines were perceived to have a significant positive impact. However, the performance of each of the indicators was mixed. Although the CBCRM programs were perceived to be effective in empowering the local fishing communities, their perceived impact on improving the state of the local fisheries resources remained limited.

Multiple drivers of invasive lionfish culling efficiency in marine protected areas,"Davis, ACD; Akins, L; Pollock, C; Lundgren, I; Johnston, MA; Castillo, B; Reale-Munroe, K; McDonough, V; Moneysmith, S; Green, SJ","Designing effective local management for invasive species poses a major challenge for conservation, yet factors affecting intervention success and efficiency are rarely evaluated and incorporated into practice. We coordinated regional efforts by divers to cull invasive lionfish (Pterois spp.) on 33 U.S. Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean protected coral reefs from 2013 to 2019 and estimated removal efficiency and efficacy as a function of environmental and habitat conditions, invasion status, and personnel expertise. Highly experienced individuals culling during crepuscular periods (<2 hr from sunrise/sunset) are three times more efficient (in terms of minutes) than novice divers during midday, suggesting: (a) retention of experienced individuals is key for efficient programs, and (b) planning culls with personnel and time of day in mind increases the number of sites covered with the same effort. Lionfish behavior and habitat characteristics had little effect on removal efficiency and efficacy, but divers had higher capture success at reefs with higher lionfish densities. We suggest reefs with persistently <20 fish ha(-1) as low priority, given that impacts to native fauna are unlikely and culling effectiveness declines to <50% below this level.

The evolution of marine protected area planning in Aotearoa New Zealand: Reflections on participation and process,"Davies, K; Murchie, AA; Kerr, V; Lundquist, C","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a critical element of fisheries management and biodiversity conservation strategies. However, MPA planning is a complex undertaking that requires consideration of ecological and other knowledge, including indigenous knowledge, as well as balancing social, cultural, and economic interests. Engaging a range of stakeholders and indigenous partners in MPA planning, establishment, and management has consistently been identified as key to successful MPA implementation. This paper interrogates MPA planning in Aotearoa New Zealand, with a focus on the role of participation and collaboration in the development and implementation of MPAs. Previous and current MPA processes were evaluated using best practice principles drawn from international MPA and other participatory process literature. Several factors hypothesised to be associated with improvements and efficiencies in the involvement of participants in MPA decision making are assessed, including aspects of participation, best available information, social learning and capacity, fair and respective process, and efficiency of administration. Processes were compared before and after introduction of the New Zealand Marine Protected Areas Policy and Implementation Plan in 2005. Areas for improvement in future evolutions of MPA planning also emerged from this research; these centre primarily on the need for inclusive and balanced participation; inclusion of multiple values and information types in MPA decision making; time to build trust and establish shared understanding; and resourcing. These recommendations represent a conceptualisation of MPAs operating within holistic social-ecological systems frameworks that encompass more than biodiversity conservation or extractive use, potentially redefining how MPAs are conceived of, developed, implemented and valued.",2018,,MARINE POLICY,93,,113-127,WOS:000434752900015,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.03.025,,#19239,Davies 2018,,

Volunteer health and emotional wellbeing in marine protected areas,"Koss, RS; Kingsley, J","Citizen science monitoring programs in the marine environment frequently focus on volunteer collected data precision for conservation and resource use of marine biota. Few studies have examined the social science aspects of volunteer engagement in marine monitoring programs in a quantifiable manner. This research focuses on emotional attitudes of Sea Search volunteers who monitor Marine National Parks and Marine Sanctuaries in Victoria, Australia. Volunteers responded that their participation in Sea Search activities made them feel good emotionally and mentally, with active learning, such as remembering names of marine biota, stimulating brain activity and memory. Volunteer monitoring efforts generated personal satisfaction through their contributions, feelings of enjoyment, and socialising with others. Sea Search volunteers gain a sense of want to protect and conserve the marine environment through positive behaviour change. By understanding and having a sense of meaning towards the marine environment, the volunteers felt a sense of pride in themselves. The concepts of volunteer connection to the natural environment and positive mental and emotional health are important for any citizen science monitoring program and should be used in the program's aims and strategies as an effective means to attract volunteers. A functional framework which clearly communicates and assesses not only the scientific expectations from a citizen science program, but also the health and wellbeing connections to nature, need to be addressed in Government marine and coastal strategies.

Exploring leadership dynamics in community-based marine protected areas,"Gabela-Flores, MV; Diedrich, A","The biological outcomes of marine protected areas (MPAs) have been variable and considering social outcomes in MPA policy is crucial to improve this trend. Stakeholders' perceptions of MPA benefits and their distributional equity influence MPA success, and research in community settings has linked perceived benefits to perceptions of trust in leadership. However, leadership dynamics are complex, and strong leadership does not necessarily equate with an alignment between perceptions of leaders and followers. The analysis in this paper builds on research conducted in the Philippines that showed people's trust in leaders influenced perceived benefits of community based MPAs. A scoring methodology is presented to quantitatively compare the alignment of perceptions of residents and leaders regarding MPAs and tourism using survey data from 19 villages with associated MPAs in Siquijor. This study aimed to 1) quantify the degree of alignment between the perceptions of residents and their leaders regarding MPAs and tourism development, and 2) assess the relationship between the residents' trust in their leaders and alignment scores. The results showed high alignment in most villages, but with notable, contextual variations between questions and villages. A positive correlation between alignment scores and trust was found, suggesting that people are likely to trust leaders who share their views. The qualitative data suggested that perceived equity in the distribution of MPA benefits might be influencing residents' trust in their leaders.

Here we build on recent studies to adapt forecasting techniques from the fields of hazard prediction, risk assessment, and intelligence analysis to forecast the likelihood of marine protected area (MPA) designation in the Southern Ocean. We used two questionnaires, feedback, and a discussion round in a Delphi-style format expert elicitation to obtain forecasts, and collected data on specific biophysical, socioeconomic, geopolitical, and scientific factors to assess how they shape and influence these forecasts. We found that areas further north along the Western Antarctic Peninsula were considered to be less likely to be designated than areas further south, and that geopolitical factors, such as global politics or events, and socioeconomic factors, such as the presence of fisheries, were the key determinants of whether an area was predicted to be more or less likely to be designated as an MPA.

Attitudes to a marine protected area are associated with perceived social impacts,"McNeill, A; Clifton, J; Harvey, ES","Marine protected areas (MPAs) conserve marine biodiversity and ecosystems by limiting or prohibiting resource use in specific areas. Reduced access to a marine resource will invariably impact local communities which reside nearby and utilise those resources. Social dimensions are recognised as crucial to the success of MPAs in meeting environmental goals, however, these dimensions are poorly understood. While much research is focused on developing countries, the majority of recent growth in MPA coverage is occurring in more economically developed settings. This research aims to address this gap by exploring the diversity of social impacts associated with an established MPA on the mid-coast of Western Australia. A range of extractive and non-extractive stakeholders were interviewed to identify the type of impacts experienced and how these are associated with attitudes towards the MPA. The results demonstrate there is a strong association between the nature of the impacts experienced by stakeholders and their attitudes. The social impacts are not distributed uniformly among stakeholders, with some groups of extractive users suffering the majority of the negative impacts and holding highly critical attitudes. The most common adverse impacts affect individual users' well-being including feelings of fear, stress, uncertainty and inequity, while impacts on fishing activities are limited. Those who reported broader scale community or environmental benefits held largely positive assessments of the MPA. Together these results illustrate the importance of identifying and mitigating the full spectrum of social impacts experienced, as opposed to a narrow focus on the disruption of fishing activities or socio-economic impacts alone.",2018,,MARINE POLICY,94,,106-118,WOS:000438659600013,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.04.020,,#19252,McNeill 2018,,

MARINE PROTECTED AREAS - AN ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC TOOL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN COASTAL AREAS,"SGEM; Todorut, AV; Tselentis, V","Coastal regions house a high concentration of often contradictory activities, directly impacting on the quality of their environment and the sustainable development of these areas. The density of these activities in a limited and geographically defined spatial coastal zone, poses significant challenges and pressures on the marine environment, as most of the activities and services are closely interrelated to marine ecosystems. The international community is developing and implementing important measures for the sustainable development of coastal communities, including the creation of marine protected area (MPA) networks. This approach is an ecosystem-based approach targeted at the management of human activities in order to sustain biodiversity and at the same time support viable economic activities essential for the sustainable development of these areas. This paper contributes to the knowledge and best practice examples pertinent to the creation and development of marine protected areas (MPAs) in Europe and the Mediterranean, analyzing ways in which this important and successful tool can be introduced and applied further in the Black Sea. The creation of MPAs is closely associated to studies mainly focusing on scientific observations of the marine environment, participation and direct involvement of stakeholders, as well as evaluating the socioeconomic impacts on coastal communities. Economic benefits of MPAs include job creation in novel areas such as environmental services and products, including non-consumptive activities such as tourism and recreation. The economic value of biological resources is difficult to express in monetary terms, whereas others such as the direct financial benefit to local economies from recreational and other activities centered on MPAs, are easier to calculate. The paper utilizes the basic methods for valuation of environmental goods and services, based on direct costs, capital costs and operating costs, such as labour costs for monitoring and protecting the area. Also indirect costs, mainly through the assessment of potential damages to fishermen who may be harmed by fishing bans, are addressed. The paper finally discusses the interactions between the complex biological, social, economic and institutional factors and proposes a generic model for attaining significant socioeconomic benefits associated with sustainable development of coastal zone areas in the Black Sea.",2013,,"GEOCONFERENCE ON ECOLOGY, ECONOMICS, EDUCATION AND LEGISLATION, SGEM 2013, VOL II",,,193-199,WOS:000348880400026,,,#19254,SGEM 2013,,
"CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS ANALYSIS OF IMPLEMENTING MPA AT THE YILAN GUEISHAN ISLAND, TAIWAN","Chuang, CT; Chen, JY; Chang, KC; Hung, LW; Liu, TK","Gueishan Island, located along the strong Kuroshio current, is one of the most essential fishing grounds in Taiwan's offshore fishery, and critical during its transitional fishery periods. However, long-term pollution, overfishing and rapid coastal development result in overexploitation and adverse environmental and ecological impacts. Previous studies focused on single species fishery management or merely the interpretation relevant laws whereas the views and perceptions of the stakeholders are often overlooked. Therefore, stakeholders' participation and co-management seem to challenge the future establishment of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Gueishan Island. This study focuses on the evaluation of stakeholders' perception and analyzes the critical success factors for MPA planning through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. The results showed that although most fishermen do not fully understand the intention of MPAs, they pay much attention to the negotiations among stakeholders before an MPA is implemented. Thus, stimulating appreciation and education about conservation and MPAs is crucial while setting up a co-management mechanism is recommended for the implementation of such MPA.",2013,,JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TAIWAN,21,4,423-429,WOS:000324356700007,10.6119/JMST-012-0628-4,,#19255,Chuang 2013,,
MarineMap: A web-based platform for collaborative marine protected area planning,"Merrifield, MS; McClintock, W; Burt, C; Fox, E; Serpa, P; Steinback, C; Gleason, M","The creation of a spatial decision support system that enabled stakeholder participation in designing marine protected areas (MPAs) was a necessary component of the planning process for California's Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) Initiative. Implementation of the MLPA required stakeholders to understand and use a complicated set of spatial and scientific guidelines for MPA design that relied heavily on geographic information. Tools for the delivery and visualization of geographic information have changed radically in the seven years of planning during the MLPA Initiative. We collaborated to create a state-of-the-art spatial decision support system called MarineMap to facilitate the design and evaluation of MPA proposals. MarineMap provided an intuitive user experience that simplified complicated spatial concepts, delivered critical information immediately to allow users to iterate through scenarios rapidly. This tool provided transparency in the process, and moved spatial analysis away from the domain of GIS experts to a broader group of stakeholders. We think the lessons from this experience can contribute to the further development of tools and approaches for coastal and marine spatial planning more broadly. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods of social assessment in Marine Protected Area planning: Is public participation enough?,"Voyer, M; Gladstone, W; Goodall, H","Addressing social and economic considerations is crucial to the success of Marine Protected Area (MPA) planning and management. Ineffective social assessment can alienate local communities and undermine the success of existing and future MPAs. It is rare to critique the success of methods used currently to incorporate social and economic considerations into MPA planning. Three Australian MPA planning processes covering three states and incorporating federal and state jurisdictions are reviewed in order to determine how potential social impacts were assessed and considered. These case studies indicate that Social Impact Assessment (SIA) is under-developed in Australian MPA planning. Assessments rely heavily on public participation and economic modelling as surrogates for dedicated SIA and are followed commonly by attitudinal surveys to gauge public opinion on the MPA after its establishment. The emergence of issues around public perception of the value of MPAs indicates the failure of some of these proposals to adequately consider social factors in planning and management. This perception may have potential implications for the long term success of individual MPAs. It may also compromise Australia's ability to meet international commitments for MPA targets to gazette at least 10% of all its marine habitats as MPAs. Indeed, this is demonstrated in two of the three case studies where social and economic arguments against MPAs have been used to delay or block the future expansion of the MPA network.

Scotland's Marine Protected Area network: Reviewing progress towards achieving commitments for marine conservation,"Hopkins, CR; Bailey, DM; Potts, T","Significant progress has been made towards implementing Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks in UK waters, with Scotland successfully designating 30 new Scottish MPA sites in July 2014. This paper reviews the Scottish MPA process up to the point of implementation, summarising the process that led to the designation of the MPA network. In particular, this paper investigates the extent to which the process i) effectively engaged stakeholders; ii) used ecological guiding principles; and iii) considered climate change. In doing so, this paper highlights several key issues if the Scottish MPA network is to move beyond an administrative exercise and is able to make a meaningful contribution to marine biodiversity protection for Europe: i) fully adopt best practice ecological principles ii) ensure effective protection and iii) explicitly consider climate change in the management, monitoring and future iterations of the network.

Ecology and Education in Marine Protected Areas: Insights from Brazil and South America,"Berchez, F; Mansilla, A; Ghilardi-Lopes, NP; Schwindt, E; Leite, K; Rozzi, R","South American coastal habitats include a wide range of benthic ecosystems, many of which are unique and constitute hotspots of biodiversity. Marine protected areas (MPAs), instituted mostly during the second half of the twentieth Century, are considered a key management tool to conserve regional biodiversity, prevent overexploitation, and generate economic benefits. Educational actions to promote changes in basic values, principles, and attitudes - although considered also as a main objective - frequently have a poor conceptual basis. In conjunction with the evaluation of their effectiveness by long-term, site-based ecological and socio-economic research, in Brazil MPAs are aiming to implement a holistic approach. This will allow the development and testing of environmental practices that integrate ecology, economy, ethics, and conflict resolution in the different uses of marine space. However, ecological long-term studies, socio-economic long-term evaluation, and the integration of education and ethics are still incipient. With the recent creation of some independent networks in different South American countries related to the assessment of biological communities, marine biologists of this continent are now focusing more on: (1) sharing methodologies and data to allow comparative and integrated continental analyses, and (2) integrating social components, including not only economic but also ethical values and participatory approaches.

Zoning of marine protected areas: Conflicts and cooperation options in the Galapagos and San Andres archipelagos,"Davos, CA; Siakavara, K; Santorineou, A; Side, J; Taylor, M; Barriga, P","Results are reported of an analysis of the conflicts that the zoning of marine protected areas might generate in the Galapagos and San Andres archipelagos given the involved stakeholders' competing interests. This will assist stakeholders, including the final decision makers, to develop cooperation strategies for managing conflicts. Specifically, the analysis focused on the stakeholders' conflicting priorities for a number of criteria deemed relevant to the evaluation of alternative geographical zoning configurations. Sets of statistically similar priorities are suggested as bargaining positions to those stakeholders who find it advantageous to seek cooperation with others sharing the same values instead of acting alone when debating MPA zoning alternatives. Another result that will contribute to cooperation strategies is the assessment of the solidarity of cohort groups of stakeholders as reflected by the extent of similarity among their priorities.

The ecological and social basis for management of a Red Sea marine-protected area,"Gladstone, W","The Farasan Islands in the southern Red Sea of Saudi Arabia have nationally and internationally significant conservation values, and are important for a range of marine-based resource uses. In preparation for the establishment of a marine protected area around the Farasan Islands and its management, surveys were undertaken to assess the slate of the coastal and marine resources, and the issues associated with human activities. Stakeholders were interviewed about issues and their attitudes towards the proposed protected area, and constraints to planning and management were identified. Marine habitats included seagrass beds, mangroves, and extensive areas of fringing reef dominated by a diverse coral community or a mixture of coral and macroalgae. Although used for a diverse range of human activities (fishing, shipping, transport, military purposes, recreation, waste dumping, sand extraction) impacts were minimal and localized. The most immediate threat to the marine resources was over-exploitation by fisheries. The types of management activities appropriate to the MPA, and the scale of management, were constrained by a number of unique and important factors: declines in national financial support for conservation efforts, a lack of trained personnel, difficulties in attracting staff to this remote location, loss of community support, the absence of a tourist base from which economic instruments could be developed, and the lack of local nongovernmental organizations. Management recommended for the Farasan Islands Marine-Protected Area included zoning, community participation in management, public awareness, and training as a first step, followed by site-specific management actions, research and monitoring, and infrastructure development.

"Will small MPAs work?: The case of small-sized MPAs in Southern Iloilo, Philippines","Espectato, LN; Napata, RP; Baylon, CC","Most of the marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Philippines are small -sized and community -based, and their contribution to the conservation efforts have been usually overlooked.This paper will present the results of the biological assessment study conducted in three community based MPAs in Southern Iloilo, Philippines. Each MPA has a 2 -ha no -take zone and this size is way below the recommended optimal size of 10-100 km(2). Results show that fish biomass showed an overall increase of about 1-5 times. This is attributed to both an increase in abundance and in fish size. Fish in this survey conducted in 2013 were about 2.3-33 times the size of fish in the 2007 baseline data. Macroepifaunal abundance increased 2 to 8 times across the three MPA sites. However, live hard coral cover showed a parallel -40% decrease across all sites, which can be attributed to several factors.The conservation goals of these MPAs have been attained. However, the results of biological assessments still need to be correlated with a study on the socioeconomic impact of the MPAs in the community to be able to arrive at good management decisions.

Customary management as precautionary and adaptive principles for protecting coral reefs in Oceania,"Aswani, S; Albert, S; Sabetian, A; Furusawa, T","Marine conservation programs in Oceania are increasingly turning to precautionary and adaptive management, particularly approaches which emphasize local participation and customary management. Although the application of community-based natural resource management is widespread in the region, the full integration of local knowledge and practices into the design, implementation, and monitoring of community-based conservation programs has been limited. There is also little empirical data to show whether or not community-based conservation projects are meeting their stated objectives. This paper summarizes an integrated method for selecting Marine Protected Area (MPA) sites and presents empirical evidence that illustrates how an MPA that was largely conceived using indigenous ecological knowledge and existing sea tenure governance (i.e., customary management practices), as part of a regional precautionary and adaptive community-based management plan, is showing signs of biological and social success.

Using the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas to promote conservation impact through marine protected areas,"Wells, S; Addison, PFE; Bueno, PA; Costantini, M; Fontaine, A; Germain, L; Lefebvre, T; Morgan, L; Staub, F; Wang, B; White, A; Zorrilla, MX","1. With the number of marine protected areas (MPAs) growing rapidly and progress being made towards protecting 10% of the ocean, as called for by the Convention on Biological Diversity, there is equally a need to increase efforts and provide incentives for effective management of these sites.2. The IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas (GLPCA), a voluntary global standard that protected areas and their agencies may decide to commit to working towards, has been set up to contribute to this.3. Protected areas can achieve Green List status by demonstrating a certain performance level and by meeting outcomes measured against a set of defined criteria. An assured verification process is followed before sites are recognized. The GLPCA will thus encourage and identify those protected areas (both terrestrial and marine) that are effectively managed, have equitable governance and achieve significant conservation impacts.4. The GLPCA pilot phase announced the first 25 protected areas to meet the criteria at the IUCN World Parks Congress in Sydney in November 2014. These included four MPAs: Iroise Natural Marine Park, Cerbere-Banyuls Natural Nature Reserve, and Guadeloupe National Park in France, and Gorgona National Park in Colombia. Italy and China also participated in the pilot phase and each has an MPA that is continuing to work towards GLPCA status.5. The experiences of these sites are described, as well as three other programmes (two regional and one global) that are being developed to promote improved management of MPAs. This information will be useful for other MPAs considering participation in the GLPCA initiative.

Marine protected areas in southern China: Upgrading conservation effectiveness in the 'eco-civilization' era,"McCook, LJ; Lian, JS; Lei, XM; Chen, Z; Xue, GF; Ang, P; Zhang, X; Huang, H","China has undergone massive economic development over the last several decades, but at the cost of serious environmental degradation, including to coastal and marine ecosystems. This paper describes the governance arrangements for management of coastal and marine areas of southern, mainland China and Hong Kong, especially marine protected areas (MPAs). Although not widely recognized internationally, there are 123 designated MPAs spread across the South China Sea coast. However, the effectiveness of these MPAs in conservation of ecosystem goods and services is seriously limited by a familiar range of pressures, including limited resources, insufficient enforcement and massive coastal development. Recent developments in national policy include integration of all protected areas (including marine) under a single agency, a range of limits on coastal development and water pollution, and the strategy of 'eco-civilization' to balance environmental management with economic development. If successfully implemented, these policies would profoundly change the course of marine environments in China, with globally significant consequences. Recommendations for improving MPA performance in China include: ensuring that marine systems are not overwhelmed within the new national jurisdiction, and maintaining and enhancing marine capacity; increased resourcing, supported by comprehensive and systematic economic valuations of ecosystem goods and services and natural capital; upgraded enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations, combined with further refinement and development, especially around cumulative impact management; a particular focus on major reduction in water pollution in all forms; integration of marine management between Hong Kong SAR and surrounding Guangdong Province; and enhanced community engagement, participation and education.

Specifically, we determine the relative importance of 12 social values and evaluate how the relationship between three highly rated social values (Aesthetic, Biological Diversity, and Recreation) and four biophysical metrics (distance to the coast, distance to management infrastructure, slope, and elevation) differed between two marine protected areas. Our results provide insight into the spatial dynamics of social-ecological data to identify high and low priority locations in protected areas as well as enable resource management agencies to make more informed decisions about how best to engage with stakeholders.

The potential impact of marine protected areas on the Senegalese sardinella fishery,"Ba, A; Chaboud, C; Schmidt, J; Diouf, M; Fall, M; Deme, M; Brehmer, P","In the early 2000s, Senegal set up several Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) along its coastal zone with the purpose of biodiversity conservation and to support sustainable management of fisheries. However, the impact of MPAs may vary according to the type of fisheries. In Senegal, the sardinella fishery accounts for 70% of total catches. This fishery is of crucial importance for national food security and employment. Given this importance, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of MPAs, often being considered as a tool for fisheries management. An analytical, dynamic and spatial bio-economic model of sardinella fishery, considering fish and fisher migration, has been developed and scenarios over forty years have been analyzed. The results show that the fishery is economically overexploited and that Senegal could lose about 11.6 billion CFA over forty years of exploitation, i.e. 290 million CFA per year. To achieve an optimal level of exploitation, it would be necessary to halve the current fishing capacity. Implementing MPAs for 10, 20 and 30% of the Senegalese exclusive economic zone lead to slight increases in biomass (1%) and rent (5-11%). In addition, spatio-temporal closures can lead to increased exploitation in unclosed areas, due to the absence of enforcement. Achieving target 11 of the Aichi Convention, i.e., 10% of coastal and marine areas protected per country, will have a reserve effect on the resource but also only lead to weak improvements in economic indicators for the Senegalese fishery. Finally, because the sardinella resource is shared among many countries of the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC), a sub-regional cooperation is necessary for a sustainable management.",2019,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,169,,239-246,WOS:000459518700024,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.12.020,,#19275,Ba 2019,,

Effective governance of a remote marine protected area: The case of Dongsha Atoll National Park,"Yu, DCY; Chiau, WY; Lu, HJ","Many fisheries in Taiwan's Dongsha Atoll National Park (DANP), a marine protected area (MPA), are subject to illicit fishing by fishers from countries around Taiwan. This study examined the governance of the DANP in response to this problem. We reviewed documents, conducted a field survey of the Dongsha Islands, held semistructured interviews with local interviewees, and analyzed records of automatic identification system (AIS) signals. We found that insufficient enforcement and a lack of interagency cooperation have impeded MPA governance in DANP since 2002. We proposed solutions in three areas. The first is detection: (1) participatory monitoring mechanisms and (2) an integrated monitoring, control, and surveillance system should be established to compensate for the limitations of coastal radar. This counteracts AIS manipulation and the use of motor powered skiffs by illegal fishers. The second is response. To respond swiftly to illegal activity, target identification is crucial. Thus, the use of technological tools, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, optical imaging systems, and acoustic surveillance systems, should supplement AIS-based identification. The third is adjudication. Because most illegal fishers are not Taiwanese, the Taiwanese government can use international agreements to prosecute (and deter) illegal fishers.

Integrating Marine Protected Areas in fisheries management systems: some criteria for ecological efficiency,"Mesnildrey, L; Gascuel, D; Le Pape, O","Through a review of the scientific literature and a more in-depth qualitative meta-analysis of 16 case studies distributed worldwide, this article aims to study impacts of MPAs on marine living resources, ecosystems and related fisheries and to highlight their criteria of efficiency as management tools for a sustainable exploitation. MPAs are efficient for conservation purposes and resource restoration, especially inside their borders. MPAs can also be part of fisheries management systems, but there is a lack of knowledge about their wider scale impacts on fish stocks, ecosystem and fisheries. Adjacent fisheries can increase their catches near closed areas, but such effects are delayed until after MPA establishment and are often limited over distance. Even though local specificities in ecosystems and fishing resources lead to high variability in MPA effects, four major criteria modulate the efficiency of MPAs for fisheries management: (1) the size of the closed area; (2) the level of protection of essential habitats for exploited resources; (3) MPA integration as part of wider integrated fisheries management plans; and (4) efficient monitoring and regulation systems, including participative decision making, to ensure that restrictive measures are respected.",2013,,AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES,26,2,159-170,WOS:000322290200005,10.1051/alr/2013056,,#19281,Mesnildrey 2013,,
Conservation actions and ecological context: optimizing coral reef local management in the Dominican Republic,"Cortes-Useche, C; Hernandez-Delgado, EA; Calle-Trivino, J; Blasco, RS; Galvan, V; Arias-Gonzalez, JE","Over the past few decades, coral reef ecosystems have been lost at accelerated rates as a result of global climate change and local stressors. Local management schemes can help improve the condition of coral reefs by enhancing their ecosystem recovery capacity. Caribbean conservation efforts include mitigation of local anthropogenic stressors, and integrating social participation. Here, we analyzed the case of the Bayahibe reefs in the Southeastern (SE) Dominican Republic to identify conservation actions and illustrate a conceptual example of local seascape management. We assessed reef health indicators from 2011 to 2016. Overall, our results show increases in total fish biomass, in both commercial and herbivorous fishes. Mean live coral cover was 31% and fleshy macroalgae was 23% after multiple disturbances such as Hurricanes Sandy and Isaac (2012), Mathew (2016) and heat stress presented in the study area in 2015. We also described actions taken by stakeholders and government institutions, including the implementation of a policy declaring an area of 869,000 ha as a marine protected area (MPA), enhanced water quality treatment, local restrictions to vessel traffic, enforcement of fishing regulations, and the removal of invasive lionfish (Pterois spp.). In addition, a restoration program for the threatened staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) was established in 2011, and currently has eight coral nurseries and six outplanting sites. Considering the biology and ecology of these reefs, we observed good results for these indicators (live coral cover, fish biomass, and water quality) in contrast with severely degraded Caribbean reefs, suggesting that optimizing local management may be a useful example for improving reef condition. Our results provide an overview of trends in reef condition in the SE Dominican Republic and could support current strategies to better protect reefs in the region. Given that Caribbean coral reefs face extreme challenges from global climate change, management measures may improve reef conditions across the region but stronger policy processes and increased scientific knowledge are needed for the successful management of coral reefs.",2021,,PEERJ,9,,,WOS:000626721800007,10.7717/peerj.10925,,#19283,Cortes-Useche 2021,,
Conditions of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Philippines observed through the MEAT database and a reality of evaluation system and the community based management in two MPA cases,"Ito, Y; Toda, M; Masuda, M","It is well recognized that the marine resources of the Philippines are increasingly and severely damaged by climate change and human interventions, including overfishing and destructive fishing. To manage its marine resources, the government has implemented marine protected area (MPA) systems, expecting the involvement of local communities in its management. Although over 1,600 MPAs had been established by 2014, it is reported that they are not effectively managed. The purpose of the study is to determine the current conditions of MPAs in the Philippines using the MPA Management Effectiveness Assessment Tool (MEAT) developed in 2010, and to identify how MEAT reflects reality through interviews at two MPAs. The MEAT data analysis shows that MEAT has not yet been fully utilized and its information is not representative of all the MPAs in the country. So far, as based on the information provided by MEAT, less than half of the MPAs are effectively managed and management effectiveness is not related to the age of the MPA or evenly distributed across regions. The field study, although limited by the fact that it is based on only two MPAs, raises the question as to whether or not local evaluation has been conducted as intended.

The cost of enforcing a marine protected area to achieve ecological targets for the recovery of fish biomass,"Brown, CJ; Parker, B; Ahmadia, GN; Ardiwijaya, R; Purwanto; Game, ET","Protected areas are the primary management tool for conserving ecosystems, yet their intended outcomes may often be compromised by poaching. Consequently, many protected areas are ineffective 'paper parks' that contribute little towards conserving ecosystems. Poaching can be prevented through enforcement and engaging with community members so they support protected areas. It is not clear how much needs to be spent on enforcement and engagement to ensure they are frequent enough to be effective at conserving biodiversity. We develop models of enforcement against illegal fishing in marine protected areas. We apply the models to data on fishing rates and fish biomass from a marine protected area in Raja Ampat, Indonesia and explore how frequent enforcement patrols need to be to achieve targets for coral reef fish biomass. Achieving pristine levels of reef fish biomass required almost year-round enforcement of the protected area. Surveillance of the protected area may also be enhanced if local fishers who support the reserve report on poaching. The opportunity for local fishing boats to participate in surveillance was too small for it to have much benefit for total reef fish biomass, which increases slowly. However, specific functional groups of fish have much higher population growth rates and their biomass was predicted to increase markedly with community surveillance. We conclude that budgets for park management must balance the cost of conducting frequent patrols against supporting alternative activities, like education to build community support. Optimized budgets will be much more likely to achieve ecological targets for recovering fish biomasses and will contribute to fiscal sustainability of protected areas.",2018,,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,227,,259-265,WOS:000449129700029,10.1016/j.biocon.2018.09.021,,#19287,Brown 2018,,
Are multiple-use marine protected areas meeting fishers' proposals? Strengths and constraints in fisheries' management in Brazil,"Macedo, HS; Medeiros, RP; McConney, P","Although still controversial among some fisheries management stakeholders, marine protected areas (MPAs) are used worldwide to address fisheries crises. This study focused on the perspectives of fishers in evaluating the effectiveness of an MPA to address their management propositions. The study analysed the drafting and implementation of a multiple-use MPA management plan in the southern coast of Brazil. It evaluated the outcomes in fulfilling the small-scale fishers' proposals, raised and collectively agreed to in a participatory drafting process. Four years after the release of the MPA management plan half of the fishers' proposals were fulfilled. Most of the fishers' fulfilled proposals were related to regulations within the MPA and to strategies to improve their political representativeness, while the majority of the proposals on fishing licensing and on public policies to foster the activity have not yet been achieved. Scale mismatches, authority limitations, and options for innovative institutional arrangements are discussed here as key elements of the results. Additionally, fishers and managers agreed on the increased management performance and learning opportunities created through the participatory process of drafting the management plan, enabling an environment for fulfilling the proposals over the medium and long terms.",2019,,MARINE POLICY,99,,351-358,WOS:000454467200043,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.11.007,,#19288,Macedo 2019,,
Management priorities for seawater desalination plants in a marine protected area: A multi-criteria analysis,"Heck, N; Paytan, A; Potts, DC; Haddad, B; Petersen, KL","The development of seawater desalination plants to increase water reliability in coastal areas poses a threat to the health of near shore marine ecosystems and may affect the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs) that have been established to meet international conservation targets. This paper applies a multi-criteria analysis approach to quantify stakeholder groups' priorities for seawater desalination plants that have been proposed in communities adjacent to a National Marine Sanctuary. All groups placed the highest importance on minimizing environmental impacts on protected areas and endangered species that could be affected by water intake and brine discharge emphasizing the need for integrated land and sea conservation. Minimizing socio-economic impacts on coastal communities was much less important. Stakeholders also weighted reducing pressure on water levels in rivers, streams, and aquifers as more important than increasing water for residential consumption, which may foster coastal growth rather than replacing water taken from other sources. The study further revealed differences in the importance of multiple management objectives among stakeholder groups, which highlights the need to elicit distinct priorities of all groups to understand concerns and potential conflicts of desalination with existing marine users. The analysis of consistency ratios revealed that around half of all surveyed stakeholders had high inconsistencies in their responses, which suggests either a lack of understanding of desalination, or reflects the complexity of establishing desalination plants in coastal areas adjacent to a marine protected area.",2017,,MARINE POLICY,86,,64-71,WOS:000414111800009,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.09.012,,#19290,Heck 2017,,

Most fish assemblage characteristics showed positive responses to protection whether it was physical (e.g. habitat complexity), biological (e.g. coral cover growth forms), or human-induced (e.g. marine reserves). Fish biomass was lowest in areas of direct wave exposure and highest in areas partially sheltered from swells. Higher values for fish species richness, number of individuals, biomass, and diversity were observed in locations with higher substrate complexity. Areas completely protected from fishing had distinct fish assemblages with higher standing stock and diversity than areas where fishing was permitted or areas that were partially protected from fishing. Locations influenced by customary stewardship harbored fish biomass that was equal to or greater than that of no-take protected areas.

Effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas in the Philippines for Biodiversity Conservation,"Weeks, R; Russ, GR; Alcala, AC; White, AT","Quantifying the extent to which existing reserves meet conservation objectives and identifying gaps in coverage are vital to developing systematic protected-area networks. Despite widespread recognition of the Philippines as a global priority for marine conservation, limited work has been undertaken to evaluate the conservation effectiveness of existing marine protected areas (MPAs). Targets for MPA coverage in the Philippines have been specified in the 1998 Fisheries Code legislation, which calls for 15% of coastal municipal waters (within 15 km of the coastline) to be protected within no-take MPAs, and the Philippine Marine Sanctuary Strategy (2004), which aims to protect 10% of coral reef area in no-take MPAs by 2020. We used a newly compiled database of nearly 1000 MPAs to measure progress toward these targets. We evaluated conservation effectiveness of MPAs in two ways. First, we determined the degree to which marine bioregions and conservation priority areas are represented within existing MPAs. Second, we assessed the size and spacing patterns of reserves in terms of best-practice recommendations. We found that the current extent and distribution of MPAs does not adequately represent biodiversity. At present just 0.5% of municipal waters and 2.7-3.4% of coral reef area in the Philippines are protected in no-take MPAs. Moreover, 85% of no-take area is in just two sites; 90% of MPAs are <1 km(2). Nevertheless, distances between existing MPAs should ensure larval connectivity between them, providing opportunities to develop regional-scale MPA networks. Despite the considerable success of community-based approaches to MPA implementation in the Philippines, this strategy will not be sufficient to meet conservation targets, even under a best-case scenario for future MPA establishment. We recommend that implementation of community-based MPAs be supplemented by designation of additional large no-take areas specifically located to address conservation targets.",2010,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,24,2,531-540,WOS:000275877600023,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01340.x,,#19292,Weeks 2010,,

However, few protected areas have been critically evaluated for their impact, which involves applying counterfactual thinking to predict conditions within protected areas if management had never occurred. Here, we use statistical matching to conduct a rigorous impact evaluation of dual management systems on coral reef fishes in Tonga, with communities having both full no-take areas and areas of exclusive fishing rights. No-take areas generally had positive impacts on the species richness, biomass, density, and size of target reef fish, while exclusive access areas were similar to predicted counterfactual conditions. The latter is likely because overall fishing pressure in exclusive access areas might not actually change, although more fish could be exploited by communities with access rights. Our findings suggest that dual management is effective at incentivizing effective community-based no-take areas for biodiversity conservation and resource management.",2020,,CONSERVATION LETTERS,13,6,,WOS:000565358500001,10.1111/conl.12755,,#19294,Smallhorn-West 2020,,

Proper management of these disputes to ensure stability in the South China Sea becomes a priority. There is a general consensus that the best approach for managing the disputes in the SCS is to set aside the sovereignty disputes and jointly develop and manage the natural resources, such as fisheries. While advancing fisheries cooperation in the SCS has been increasingly recognized as a political, ecological, socioeconomic and security imperative, two crucial questions remain insufficiently addressed: what objectives should be achieved via fisheries cooperation in the SCS and are the prevailing fisheries cooperation options feasible and effective in achieving these objectives? The author makes the case that three primary objectives need to be accomplished, namely, 1) achieving food security and economic development, 2) ensuring sustainable fishery and protecting marine environment, and 3) preventing fishing conflicts and disputes. Using these three objectives as evaluation criteria, the author then investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of three prevailing options, including Marine Protected Areas (MPA)/Marine Peace Park, Regional Fishery Management Organizations (RFMO), and aquaculture.",2018,,MARINE POLICY,89,,67-76,WOS:000426414500008,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.12.014,,#19298,Zhang 2018,,

The questionnaire was used to collect information on demographics, capital assets and individuals' perceptions of the marine parks. The ecological evaluation involved comparative analyses of the coral reef benthic structure, urchin and fish censuses as well as a stakeholder interview survey to assess changes inside and outside the boundaries of the marine parks. The evaluation of the managerial regime of the MPAs involved a review of the legislative policies and institutional mechanisms incorporated in the management plans of the study sites.Results indicated that variation in the institutional arrangements for management and different management plans has resulted in different effects on the social and economic characteristics of user groups. For the most part, the unofficially managed Negril Marine Park achieves its management objectives yet exhibits minimal economic and social impacts on stakeholders, concurrent with minimal ecological improvements. The Princess Alexandra Land and Sea National Park being designated anon-consumptive use area with little community participation, produces relatively more social than economic and ecological impacts on stakeholders.In general, there have been minimal ecological changes associated with the implementation of the MPAs and minimal economic impacts on stakeholders.

Community-based conservation results in the recovery of reef fish spawning aggregations in the Coral Triangle,"Hamilton, RJ; Potuku, T; Montambault, JR","In the Coral Triangle community-based marine protected areas (MPAs) are being established at a prolific rate. Their establishment can benefit both fisheries and biodiversity, and they provide both a socially and economically acceptable means of managing coral reefs in developing nations. However, because such MPAs are typically small (usually <0.5 km(2)), they will rarely provide protection to large mobile fishes. An exception to this limitation may exist when community-based MPAs are established to protect small sites where vital processes occur, such as fish spawning aggregations (FSAs). To test the effectiveness of small (0.1-0.2 km(2)) MPAs for protecting FSAs, we monitored three FSA sites where brown-marbled grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus), camouflage grouper (Epinephelus polyphekadion) and squaretail coralgrouper (Plectropomus areolatus) aggregate to spawn. Sites were monitored during peak reproductive periods (several days prior to each new moon) between January 2005 and November 2009. All three sites are located in New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea, and had been exploited for decades, but in 2004 two sites were protected by the establishment of community-based MPAs. The third site continued to be exploited. Over the monitoring period densities of E. fuscoguttatus and E. polyphekadion increased at both MPAs, but not at the site that remained open to fishing. At one MPA the densities of E. polyphekadion increased tenfold. Our findings demonstrate that community-based MPAs that are appropriately designed and adequately enforced can lead to the recovery of populations of vulnerable species that aggregate to spawn.

By framing scenarios in a simple model of the prisoner dilemma and using multicriteria analysis with Delphos-an open-source multicriteria program developed by NGOs for this purpose-we show how conservationists and fishers might have a potential benefit of competing for marine spaces, but not as much as they could gain if they collaborate.

Lack of evidence that governance structures provide real ecological benefits in marine protected areas,"Stafford, R","The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has set targets for the total area of marine protected areas (MPAs), as well as targets to encourage a participatory approach to governance with equitable sharing of benefits of these areas to multiple stakeholders. These targets have contributed to a considerable volume of research in MPA governance, and in the ecological effectiveness of MPAs. However, examining the literature demonstrates there is very little joined up research to show that any particular governance approach results in improved ecological indices of fish stocks or biodiversity. Indeed, some of the well-cited examples of participatory governance implying improved ecological metrics are either incorrect (as data do not relate to MPAs under participatory governance systems), or do not provide any ecological data other than opinions of fishers to back up the claims. Evidence suggests that participatory governance approaches with equitable sharing of benefits can help the establishment and management of MPAs, and as such, there should be urgent further work assessing the ecological benefits that arise as a result of the establishment of MPAs with participatory and equitable governance approaches.",2018,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,152,,57-61,WOS:000423647300006,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2017.11.013,,#19314,Stafford 2018,,
"Dynamics of fish assemblages on coral reefs subjected to different management regimes in the Abrolhos Bank, eastern Brazil","Francini, RB; de Moura, RL","1. Marine protected areas (MPAs) range from multiple-use areas (MUA) to absolute no-take reserves (NTR). Despite their importance for fisheries management, there are few long-term studies comparing benefits from different types of MPAs within the same region.2. Fish assemblages were monitored for five years (2001-2005) in the largest coral reefs in the South Atlantic (Abrolhos Bank, Brazil). Monitoring included one community-based MUA two NTRs (one established in 1983 and another in 2001), and one unprotected area. Benthic assemblages at these areas, as well as fish assemblages on unprotected deeper reefs (25-35 m), were monitored from 2003 onwards.3. Habitat characteristics strongly influenced fish assemblages' structure. This, together with the lack of data from before establishment of the MPAs, did not allow an unequivocal analysis of the effects of the MPAs.4. Biomass of commercially important fish, particularly small carnivores, was higher in the older NTR. Biomass of black grouper Mycteroperca bonaci increased by 30-fold inside NTRs during the study period, while remaining consistently low elsewhere.5. A single herbivore species, the parrotfish Scarus trispinosus, dominated fish assemblages (28.3% of total biomass). Biomass of this species increased in 2002 on the younger NTR and on the MUA, soon after establishment of the former and banning of the parrotfish fishery in the latter. This increase was followed by a decline from 2003 onwards, after increased poaching and reopening of the parrotfish fishery.6. Fish biomass increased in 2002 across the entire region. This increase was stronger in sites closer to deeper reefs, where fish biomass was up to 30-times higher than shallow reefs: movement of fish from deeper to shallower areas may have played a role.7. The effective use of MPAs in the Abrolhos Bank is still dependent on adequate enforcement and the protection of critical habitats such as deep reefs and mangroves.

Long-term collective engagement showed that the emergence of key actors and the progression towards an outcome-driven agenda might have the downside to partially demobilize less active members. Further, the increased legitimacy of group action provided by institutional recognition may diminish adaptive capacity and group resilience.

Integrated coastal management and marine protected areas: Complementarity in the Philippines,"White, AT; Eisma-Osorio, RL; Green, SJ","Small marine protected areas (MPAs) were established in the Philippines as early as 1974. These models set forth a framework for coral reef management that has been shown to enhance fish yields to traditional fishers as well as protect and maintain near-shore coral reef habitats for biodiversity and multiple economic uses. The history of MPAs is described in relation to the evolution of integrated coastal management (ICM) in the Philippines. Devolution of authority for management of natural resources to local governments in 1991 was a major national policy shift that has supported more localized management efforts. This policy shift has encouraged more MPAs but not a higher rate of success. As the numbers of MPAs increased, the need for a support base beyond the MPA has become apparent. A convergence of MPAs within ICM programs was seen by 2000. Numerous experiments in coastal management have thus been conducted that range from broad area management planning for whole bays to small community-based MPA projects. Important lessons with implications for broader-based support systems required by MPAs within ICM, include: The importance of a well-articulated process that includes community participation and ownership in collaboration with single or multi-municipal governments; the role of multiple stakeholders, government and donor agencies in planning and management; the creative use of financial mechanisms to create long-term self-supporting MPAs; the need for localized periodic monitoring and evaluation to provide feedback to managers, and the need for nesting of MPAs within ICM through broad area planning and implementation.

The relationship of social capital and fishers' participation in multi-level governance arrangements,"Nenadovic, M; Epstein, G","The need for effective multi-level governance arrangements is becoming increasingly urgent because of complex functional interdependencies between biophysical and socioeconomic systems. We argue that social capital plays an important role in such systems. To explore the relationship between social capital and participation in resource governance arenas, we analyzed various small-scale fisheries governance regimes from the Gulf of California, Mexico. The components of social capital that we measured include levels of fishers' structural ties to relevant groups and levels of trust in different entities (i.e. cognitive component). We collected data using surveys and interviews with residents of small-scale fishing communities adjacent to marine protected areas. We analyzed the data using a logistic regression model and narrative analysis. The results of our quantitative analysis highlight the multidimensional nature of social capital and reveals complex relationships between different types of social capital and fisher participation in monitoring, rulemaking and MPA design. Furthermore our qualitative analysis suggests that participation in fisheries conservation and management is not fully potentialized due to the social and historical context of participatory spaces in Mexico.

Particular attention is paid to the influence of statutory marine biodiversity conservation obligations to the European Commission for marine special areas of conservation (MSACs), as these are an important external contextual factor. The risks of imposition and parochialism are outlined and the challenges of taking a balanced approach are discussed. The challenges posed by the attributes of the marine environment are considered, as are those posed by the policy framework for MSACs. The findings are discussed in relation to three questions: (i) which partnership models appear to have the potential to overcome the CAPs posed by inshore MSACs? (ii) what CAPs had to be addressed during the early phase of development of the MSAC co-management regimes? (iii) what are the likely future CAPs for the collaborative management of MSACs that each partnership will need to address? These preliminary findings will form the basis for future studies to analyse the outcomes of these 15 initiatives, in order to assess the strengths, in various contexts, of different approaches for building resilient and balanced, thereby effective, institutions for the co-management of MSACs in the UK.

"Understanding Relational Politics in MPA Governance in Northeastern Iloilo, Philippines","Fernandez, PR","Fernandez P.R., 2007. Understanding Relational Politics in MPA Governance in Northeastern Iloilo, Philippines. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 50 (Proceedings of the 9th International Coastal Symposium) 38 - 42. Gold Coast, Australia, ISSN 0749.0208The Philippines archipelago is an important centre of tropical coastal marine biodiversity. Since the 1970s, various national and international actors have popularised marine protected areas (MPAs) as an effective tool for coastal conservation, tourism and even social empowerment. Scholars and practitioners however, overlook the different actors and complex institutions that frame and contest MPA design, implementation and outcomes. Pursuing apolitical perspectives and strategies in MPA governance and management, in turn, lead to continued environmental destruction and impoverished small-scale fishers. This paper describes the resources, power and relationship of key actors in MPA decision-making in four sites in northeastern Iloilo Province, Philippines. The paper explains that state-led, community-based and co-managed MPAs in the case study sites are socially constructed and contested. In such MPA spaces, actors have complex negotiations that have diverse and uncertain socio-political and ecological results. It is argued, however, that unless state and non-state actors link improved coastal ecosystem management, effective MPA governance and opportunities to enhance local livelihoods, then existing institutional arrangements will unlikely promote social justice and equity. In addition the major ecological effects of the Solar 1-Petron oil spill of August, 2006 are described and the potential implications of the disaster to the institutional resilience of MPA management systems are evaluated.",2007,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,,,38-42,WOS:000207860300008,,,#19333,Fernandez 2007,,
Integrating social network development into marine protected area management capacity building and institutionalization in the Philippines and Indonesia,"Nelson, A; Johnson, GL; Wenzel, L; Antoine, A; Avilla, L; Manubag, ML","Recent research demonstrates a critical and ongoing need for capacity building of marine protected area (MPA) practitioners in order to ensure effective management of MPAs and MPA networks that protect coastal and marine ecosystems. MPA capacity development needs are site and network specific, although commonly include leadership development, building shared goals across networks, understanding impacts and identifying appropriate management approaches, and building system-wide monitoring and evaluation programmes. Designing capacity-building programmes at the network scale can contribute directly to enhancing learning and social networking, sustaining and strengthening effective management of ecosystems, and improving coordinated network governance. Network-wide capacity building amplifies the effect and availability of technical resources and expertise, lessons learned at different management scales, and collaborative decision-making. The net result is shared capacity development across the network and improved functioning of multiple MPAs as a unit, all from a singular capacity-building effort. In the spirit of contributing to the ongoing growth of the global social network of MPA practitioners, this paper shares observations from social MPA network building as part of recent MPA capacity building in the Philippines and Indonesia. These programmes deliver technical capacity and a participatory learning framework for participants to enhance their MPA social network and support long-term implementation of gained knowledge and skills. Important elements in supporting successful network development through capacity-building programming include: comprehensive needs assessment; strong collaborative partnerships for programme delivery; clear learning objectives and intended long-term results; and strong and sustained political will at the local, national, and regional scales. Each MPA site, region, and capacity-building programme is unique in structure and content, yet what all programmes have in common is that they build on the principles of trust and community building to create a locally relevant format and framework for the network to flourish.",2019,,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,29,,233-244,WOS:000491946500020,10.1002/aqc.3050,,#19334,Nelson 2019,,
Assessing the effects of marine protected area (MPA) on a reef fish assemblage in a northwestern Mediterranean marine reserve: Identifying community-based indicators,"Claudet, J; Pelletier, D; Jouvenel, JY; Bachet, F; Galzin, R","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly envisaged as a tool to manage coastal ecosystems and fisheries. Assessment of their performance with respect to management objectives is therefore important. A number of WAS provided conservation benefits for fished species. Observed benefits do not apply to all species at all times, and responses to protection are also highly variable among fish taxa. Among the many empirical studies on marine reserves, only a few designs considered 'before and after data' and spatial variation. In this paper, we are interested in assessing the effect of a no-take reserve on the reef fish assemblage in a northwestern Mediterranean example. Data were obtained from a three-year survey using underwater visual censuses (UVC), before and after MPA establishment. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and multivariate regression trees (MRT) were used to evaluate the effects of reserve protection on the reef fish assemblage, while accounting for habitat. Modelled biological responses were abundances and diversity indices calculated at different levels of the assemblage. Significant effects were found for many of these metrics. in addition to PERMANOVA, univariate models provided more insight into the magnitude and direction of effects. The most sensitive metrics were related to large species and species targeted by fishing. These results may be used to choose the metrics that are more suitable as community-based indicators of MPA impact in the perspective of monitoring programs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Adapting stakeholder processes to region-specific challenges in marine protected area network planning,"Fox, E; Poncelet, E; Connor, D; Vasques, J; Ugoretz, J; McCreary, S; Monie, D; Harty, M; Gleason, M","Marine protected area (MPA) network planning in California was conducted over the course of nearly seven years through implementation of the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA). State agency and contract staff collaborated through a public private partnership called the MLPA Initiative (Initiative), supporting regional groups of stakeholders in crafting MPA network proposals for consideration by the MLPA Blue Ribbon Task Force (BRTF) and ultimately the California Fish and Game Commission. To design a statewide network, the Initiative divided California's 1770 km coastline into five ""study regions"" for sequential planning, each with a separate ""regional stakeholder group"" (RSG) consisting of fishermen, conservationists, recreational users, and others with intimate knowledge of the area, who were tasked with proposing alternative MPA network designs. Each study region presented a different set of factors that needed to be considered by Initiative staff in designing the overall stakeholder planning process. Furthermore, as planning for each study region was completed, a formal ""lessons learned"" evaluation was conducted that informed process design in subsequent study regions. Thus, designing a statewide MPA network through regional MPA planning processes presented the opportunity and challenge of adapting the stakeholder process design to both regional differences and lessons learned over time. This paper examines how differences in regional characteristics and lessons learned influenced three important elements of the stakeholder process, including convening the stakeholders, managing stakeholder engagement, and integrating input from managing state agencies. The fundamental structure and unique management characteristics of the Initiative were essential in facilitating adaptation of these process elements over time. The California MLPA Initiative provides a case study in process flexibility to address changing contexts and a model for similar coastal and marine spatial planning processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluating anthropogenic threats to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands,"Selkoe, KA; Halpern, BS; Toonen, RJ","1. Every manager must assess and prioritize anthropogenic impacts on their management area from a long list of threats, but data which allow comparison of the relative ecological impacts of threats for decision-making is often unavailable.2. This study employed a systematic and standardized method to collect and quantitatively synthesize expert opinion on the ecological effects of anthropogenic threats to the world's largest marine protected area: the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (MNM) in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI).3. In contrast to most threat ranking exercises, the method provides detail on the reasons behind a particular ranking of threats to an area and why the ranking may vary across the ecological landscape.4. Survey results from 25 experts allowed the comparison of the Vulnerability of eight NWHI ecozones to 24 anthropogenic threats in a quantitative manner.5. Ecozones tended to have distinct top threats: sea-level rise was identified its the top threat to rocky intertidal, beach and terrestrial ecozones; sea temperature rise was the top threat to the coral reef ecozones; bottom fishing was the top threat to the deep reef/bank ecozone; and pelagic fishing in the wider Pacific was the top threat to the pelagic ecozone owing to impacts on bird, turtle and fish fauna that forage outside the Papahanaumokuakea MNM boundaries. 6. Many of these top threats are difficult for local managers to control because they arise from activities outside the Papahanaumokuakea MNM boundaries, indicating that additional work is needed to preserve the NWHI despite its highly protected status. The analysis indicates where inter-agency cooperation in removing and mitigating threats should be focused.

Social capital as a key determinant of perceived benefits of community-based marine protected areas,"Diedrich, A; Stoeckl, N; Gurney, GG; Esparon, M; Pollnac, R","Globally, marine protected areas (MPAs) have been relatively unsuccessful in meeting biodiversity objectives. To be effective, they require some alteration of people's use and access to marine resources, which they will resist if they do not perceive associated benefits. Stakeholders' support is crucial to ecological success of MPAs, and their support is likely to depend on their capacity to adapt to and benefit from MPAs. We examined the influence of social adaptive capacity (SAC) on perceived benefits of MPAs in Siquijor, Philippines, in the Coral Triangle. This region has substantial biodiversity and a population of over 120 million people, many of them dependent on marine resources for food and income. The region has many MPAs, most of which are managed under decentralized governance systems. We collected survey data from 540 households in 19 villages with associated MPAs. We evaluated the influence of multiple SAC variables (e.g., occupational multiplicity and social capital) on perceived benefits with decision trees (CHAID) and qualitatively analyzed this relationship with respect to types and recipients of benefits. Our models revealed the key role of social capital, particularly trust in leadership, in influencing perceptions of benefits ((2) = 14.762, p = 0.000). A path analysis revealed that perceptions of distributional equity were a key mechanism through which social capital affected perceived MPA benefits (root mean-square error of approximation = 0.050). Building social capital and equity within communities could lead to more effective management of MPAs and thus to expenditure of fewer resources relative to, for example, regulation enforcement.",2017,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,31,2,311-321,WOS:000395713800008,10.1111/cobi.12808,,#19343,Diedrich 2017,,
A large-scale marine protected area for the sea of Rapa Nui: From ocean grabbing to legitimacy,"Aburto, JA; Gaymer, CF; Govan, H","The last decade has seen a noticeable advance in ocean protection through the creation of several LSMPAs which are largely driven by Aichi Target 11 under CBD. This paper uses the ""Ocean grabbing framework"" to assess the process preceding the announcement of a LSMPA in Rapa Nui, its rejection, the reformulation of the process and the ultimately successful establishment of a Multiple Uses Marine Protected Area (MUMPA). The assessment focused on: a) the quality of governance, b) the effects on livelihoods and human security, and 3) the potentially interlinked social and ecological impacts. The rejection of the initial LSMPA process was associated with lack of transparency, inadequate participatory processes, and lack of accountable decision-making all of which could have had adverse social and ecological outcomes and turned the LSMPA into an ""ocean grab"". Factors that contributed were associated to inappropriate use of financing, political lobbying and pressure exerted by a NGO that tried to deploy its agenda disconnected from local indigenous interests. In a major turning point stemming from the vigorous local rejection of the initial LSMPA, a bottom-up process led by a local institution (CODEIPA) and other Rapanui organizations, coordinated with the Chilean Government, resulted in an unprecedented participatory process ending in the creation of the largest MPA in the Americas, that will be comanaged by Rapanui people and the Chilean Government. It is hoped that the results of this analysis can contribute to the development of good practices in marine conservation worldwide, maximizing marine conservation outcomes and avoiding undesirable social and ecological impacts.",2020,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,198,,,WOS:000594739500010,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105327,,#19345,Aburto 2020,,
Emerging frontiers in perceptions research for aquatic conservation,"Gelcich, S; O'Keeffe, J","1. Aquatic ecosystems support the livelihoods and food security of millions of people globally, yet face critical challenges from local threats and global pressures.2.

"Demography and shell use of the terrestrial hermit crab Coenobita clypeatus Fabricius, 1787 (Decapoda: Anomura: Coenobitidae) in two marine protected areas in Puerto Rico","Colon-Pineiro, Z; Nieves-Alvarez, JJ; Rodriguez-Fourquet, C","Individuals of the terrestrial hermit crab Coenobita clypeatus use different gastropod shells for shelter during their life span. Availability of shells affects population traits, including density and size structure, influencing their fitness and survival. Locality and human presence can induce variation in the diversity and size of gastropod shells, influencing available shells for hermit crabs. We assessed how the diversity, size, and abundance of the occupied species of gastropod shells affect the density and demography of C. clypeatus in two marine protected areas (MPA) with different recreational use in Puerto Rico, Manati (high) and Mona Island (low). We also evaluated the relationship between three shell traits (length, width, and aperture length) and the length of the crab chela as a size proxy. We did not find differences in the sex ratio. The density and median chela sizes were higher in crabs from Manati. In Mona, however, they reached larger sizes. The diversity of occupied shell species was higher in Manati than in Mona. Dimensions of occupied shells differed between genera and between study sites, and they scaled positively with hermit crab size. Differences in shells diversity, sizes, and abundance between MPAs might cause differences in density and demography of C. clypeatus. We only found large shells of Cittarium pica (Linnaeus, 1758), the only species occupied by larger individuals, occupied by hermit crabs in Mona. The low abundance of C. pica shells in Manati might have affected the size of hermit crabs in this locality. Our in situ findings suggest that hermit crabs need larger shells to reach larger sizes as previously shown, and that location and the degree of human intervention might influence the availability of gastropod shells. Our study is the first attempt to characterize the demography and gastropod shells used by hermit crabs in Puerto Rico.",2021,,JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY,41,1,,WOS:000649390100015,10.1093/jcbiol/ruaa101,,#19347,Colon-Pineiro 2021,,
Influence of Governance Context on the Management Performance of Marine Protected Area Networks,"Horigue, V; Fabinyi, M; Pressey, RL; Foale, S; Alino, PM","In the Philippines, networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) are more complex than individual MPAs, primarily due to involvement of multiple governance units. Hence, there is a need to understand the influence of governance context of networks on management performance. We addressed this need indirectly by evaluating the participation of network members and the governance capacity of three MPA networks with varying sizes, histories, and compositions of local governments and constituencies. We defined participation as the involvement of local governments and other stakeholders in decision-making processes. We defined governance capacity as the ability to govern interactions of social, economic, and political processes and dynamics in a political unit. We used qualitative, semi-structured key informant interviews and focus group discussions to ascertain whether participation and governance capacity are influenced by network size, institutional arrangements, and social and political contexts. We found that the sizes of the MPA networks did not affect participation and governance capacity. Instead, participation and capacity were influenced by institutional arrangements and the socioeconomic and political contexts of the local governments involved. We found that less complicated network objectives and systems for engagement, more inclusive membership, better communication, incentive systems, and strong leadership enhanced participation and governance capacity.",2016,,COASTAL MANAGEMENT,44,1,71-91,WOS:000370390900004,10.1080/08920753.2016.1116678,,#19348,Horigue 2016,,
Improving compliance of recreational fishers with Rockfish Conservation Areas: community-academic partnership to achieve and evaluate conservation,"Ban, NC; Kushneryk, K; Falk, J; Vachon, A; Sleigh, L","Compliance is a key factor in ensuring success of marine conservation. We describe a community-academic partnership that seeks to reduce non-compliance of recreational fishers with Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) around Galiano Island in British Columbia, Canada. Previous work showed mostly unintentional non-compliance by recreational fishers. From 2015 to 2018 we developed and implemented outreach and public education activities. We distributed information at community events, and installed 46 metal signs with maps of nearby RCAs at marinas, ferry terminals, and boat launches. During the summers of 2015, 2017, and 2018, we interviewed 86 recreational fishers to gauge their compliance with RCAs. Compared with a baseline in 2014, there was a reduction of 22% (from 25 to 3%) of people who unintentionally fished in RCAs with prohibited gears. In 2018, 67% of participants had seen our outreach materials. We used trail cameras overlooking RCAs to assess non-compliance in six locations on Galiano Island. Illegal fishing incidents within RCAs declined from 42% of days monitored in 2014 to 14% in 2018. Although our outreach efforts were limited in scale and scope, they appear to be making a difference.

Benefits beyond 'features': Cooperative monitoring highlights MPA value for enhanced seabed integrity,"Pikesley, SK; Solandt, JL; Trundle, C; Witt, MJ","The global marine environment has seen recent rapid growth in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). In UK (English) waters, MPAs incorporate Special Protection Areas (SPAs), Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs), each with specific conservation objectives. In accordance with legislation, the UK has adopted a feature-based approach to MPA designation and monitoring, whereby protection of listed species and habitats are prioritised. The Eddystone Reef (part of the Start Point to Plymouth Sound and Eddystone SAC, South West UK) is designated solely for its reef features. The reef is at high risk from fisheries, particularly bottom-towed fishing gear. On 1st of January 2014 bottom-towed fisheries were prohibited within designated areas of the reef. In this study, images from drop-down camera surveys were analysed to quantitatively assess patterns in diversity and abundance of benthic fauna on reef and mixed substratum habitats that are closed, and remain open, to bottom-towed fisheries. Coarse sediments in areas closed to bottom-towed gear supported a greater abundance of sessile, upright, slow growing species (e.g. pink sea fans, ross coral, branching sponges) than were present in areas still actively towed over. Coarse sediments open to bottom-towed gear had greater abundances of motile, scavenging or opportunistic species. This study highlights the potential for positive conservation benefits beyond the traditional feature-based approach to MPA designation and monitoring. Further conservation gains could be made by reducing fragmentation of protected habitats and by increasing area coverage of statutory controls on bottom-towed fishing in already designated MPAs.",2021,,MARINE POLICY,134,,,WOS:000709733400010,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104801,,#19350,Pikesley 2021,,
"Socio-cultural context of fishers' participation in coastal resources management in Anini-y, Antique in west central Philippines","Aldon, MET; Fermin, AC; Agbayani, RF","The vicious cycle of poverty, overfishing and resource degradation in coastal communities in the Philippines calls for action that will address the problem of declining fish catch and degraded fish habitats. The literature has shown that an efficient and effective coastal management program can be instrumental in approaching this problem. In order to secure food and livelihood of fishers, the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center/Aquaculture Department collaborated with the local government of Anini-y. Antique to develop a sustainable utilization of natural marine resources through sea ranching of abalone within the Nogas Island marine protected area. Establishing a marine protected area is a means of conserving natural stocks while sea ranching is considered an effective strategy that can increase fishery resources. The two management schemes are considered as effective coastal resources management strategies. The success of a sea-ranching project is dependent not only on biophysical but also on socioeconomic factors as determinants of community participation and cooperation. A social assessment was conducted to determine the fishers' socio-cultural characteristics, their perceptions of their coastal resources and knowledge on how to effectively manage these coastal resources. The fishers' awareness on fishing regulations and the extent of their participation in community's coastal resources management activities were also determined. Data were collected from a household survey using a semi-structured questionnaire, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with key informants. The fishers generally scored low in almost all aspects of their socioeconomic wellbeing. Most fishers perceived that their coastal resources were in a bad condition which they attributed to illegal and commercial fishing, increasing number of fishers and the poor enforcement of fishery regulations. However, the weighted mean scores of their knowledge on coastal resources management, awareness to fishery regulations and participation in community coastal resource management activities were average. This implied that fishers when trained and developed can become potential partners for effective coastal resources management programs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The no-take zone network of the Mexican Caribbean: assessing design and management for the protection of coral reef fish communities,"Espinosa-Andrade, N; Suchley, A; Reyes-Bonilla, H; Alvarez-Filip, L","Understanding the effects and benefits provided by the design and management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is crucial for developing cost-effective management actions. We characterized the management and design of no-take zone (NTZ) networks of eight Mexican Caribbean MPAs. To determine protection effectiveness, we followed a two-step approach. First, we evaluated the effect of the level of protection (NTZ, partial and unprotected areas), habitat structure and local human threats on four fish community metrics: total biomass, commercial fish biomass, mean trophic level and commercial fish mean size. If the protection afforded by the NTZ was significant, a second model was developed to evaluate design and management effectiveness. Total biomass, commercial fish biomass and mean trophic level were correlated significantly and positively with no-take protection; and, partially protected areas showed a significant and positive correlation with commercial fish biomass and mean trophic level. MPA age was the only significant and positive design and management characteristic that explained the variation in commercial fish biomass. This might be in part due to the suboptimal design of the MPA network that has mostly resulted from economic and social opportunities with little consideration for ecological guidelines and management capacities. Our findings suggest that to increase reef fish protection it would be necessary to include reef habitats with high coral cover and structural complexity inside NTZs. However, the effectiveness of an MPA network not only requires ecological considerations but also factors that include compliance, enforcement and true community participation to achieve greater benefits. Policymakers must ensure adequate design and management of MPAs in order to improve the effectiveness of marine resource protection, promoting both sustainable use and long-term biodiversity conservation.",2020,,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,29,6,2069-2087,WOS:000522656400019,10.1007/s10531-020-01966-y,,#19354,Espinosa-Andrade 2020,,

As MPAs have proliferated, the conservation community has begun to supplement traditional biological metrics with social and community considerations in the way it seeks to manage and evaluate such tools. To assess management outcomes and opportunities for a network of community -based, marine no-take zones (NTZs) in the Mexican Caribbean, semi-structured interviews were carried out with fishers and key management stakeholders. Findings indicate that the community-based management strategy has inherent tradeoffs between community engagement and conservation potential. Managers have succeeded in fostering high levels of community support for the initiative, but significant challenges remain, most notably the high presence of illegal fishing within NTZs. Successes and challenges of the community-based management strategy are documented and evaluated within a fisheries resource management framework.

Assessing the socioeconomic effects of multiple-use MPAs in a European setting: A national stakeholders' perspective,"Rodriguez-Rodriguez, D; Rees, SE; Rodwell, LD; Attrill, MJ","The designation of marine protected areas (MPAs) may have intense social and economic effects on human communities. Driven by overarching global and European policies and national legislations, current systematic conservation planning in the UK and France requires an ecosystem approach that takes into account not only nature but also the human activities that take place in an area. Here, we identified a set of 64 socioeconomic variables potentially relevant for marine and coastal stakeholders in a European context and a comprehensive set of 20 marine and coastal stakeholder categories. Ninety national organisations in the UK and France belonging to those categories and potentially affected by/interested in the designation of multiple-use MPAs were identified and surveyed. Results show that environmental NGOs, research centres, local councils, managing agencies and statutory nature conservation bodies perceived that they are positively affected by these MPAs, whereas fishers' organisations, shipping and aggregate industrial organisations and recreational organisations perceived to be chiefly negatively affected by MPAs. On average, the ecological effects of multiple-use MPAs are perceived as 'largely positive', though 30% of respondents did not perceive any positive ecological effects from these MPAs. The social, economic and cultural effects of such MPAs are perceived as 'moderately positive'. Most respondents perceived broad range (>10 km) and permanent ecological, social, economic and cultural effects from multiple-use MPA designation suggesting high societal expectations towards these areas. However, only five variables were perceived to vary in intensity after the designation of multiple-use MPAs: 'research', 'environmental performance by citizens, businesses and towns', 'number of green businesses', 'tourism' and 'economic activities'. The most important 'social' variables for stakeholder organisations referred to local populations' engagement with the MPA, tourism and research. The most important 'economic' variables were linked to fishing, shipping and aquaculture activities. These variables highlight relevant topics to be considered in MPA planning, designation and management processes, especially in the UK and France. There were statistically significant differences in the ratings of socioeconomic variables between many organisations belonging to the same intuitive stakeholder categories, suggesting the importance of including as wide a range of stakeholder organisations as feasible in MPA socioeconomic-related processes. Our methods and findings can help to inform and streamline ongoing and future participatory MPA planning, management and monitoring processes in Europe and in other regions with similar socioeconomic characteristics.

It's a trust thing: Assessing fishermen's perceptions of the California North Coast marine protected area network,"Ordonez-Gauger, L; Richmond, L; Hackett, S; Chen, C","The California's Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) is a recent high-profile initiative that led to the implementation of a network of 124 marine protected areas (MPAs) encompassing 16% of state waters. The effort was conducted through six different regional processes that incorporated stakeholder and scientific involvement, ending with the North Coast region. While the initiative has been described as a success in terms of implementation, there has been relatively little empirical research about social perceptions of the MPA network in order to examine whether stakeholders view the effort as successful. Our research team conducted surveys with 178 commercial and charter fishermen and held five focus groups in each of the major ports of the region in order to assess fishermen's perceptions of the California North Coast MPA network- including perceptions of both the process of implementation and potential outcomes from the network. Among fishermen, satisfaction with the overall process was low; however, the level of satisfaction with the inclusion of local input and the final location of the MPAs was more evenly divided. Levels of trust in management entities, including those who implemented the MPA network, were low. Additionally, in focus group discussions, fishermen described several perceived shortcomings of the process, including an overall ""top-down"" approach, a failure to consider the local context, and the appearance of being dismissive of fishermen's perspectives. In terms of outcomes, fishermen overwhelmingly did not believe that the MPA network would improve ocean health or their income from fishing. Qualitatively, fishermen reported that while they were experiencing some minor adverse effects from the MPA network, overall they did not believe that socioeconomic impacts on the fishing industry from the MPA network would be substantial. Many expressed relief that the location of MPAs avoided many important fishing grounds. Trust emerged as an important variable. For example, the reported level of trust by fishermen in the entity that implemented the MPA network had a statistically significant correlation with their level of satisfaction with the overall process, including the final location of the MPA network. Findings complicate initial assessments of the MLPA implementation process as an overall success, and highlight the importance of trust to building successful and lasting marine conservation initiatives.",2018,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,158,,144-153,WOS:000436212500015,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.03.034,,#19361,Ordonez-Gauger 2018,,
Each fisherman is different: Taking the environmental perception of small-scale fishermen into account to manage marine protected areas,"Silva, MRO; Lopes, PPM","One of the reasons for the failure of some Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is the lack of respect for their boundaries and regulations, which intensifies the need to assess the attitudes of stakeholders affected by MPAs. To this end, it is necessary to know the perception and behavior of resource users in these areas in relation to the management process. This study addressed the perception of different groups of fishermen in three MPAs that allow sustainable use of resources on the Brazilian northeastern coast. The perception analysis was based on four aspects; biodiversity conservation, flexibility and adaptability of fishermen, participation in management and opinions about the MPA. The interviewed fishermen (n=100) were classified into natives or immigrants, >= than 40 years old or <40, predominant use of selective or nonselective fishing gear and part or full time fishermen. The results showed that younger fishermen and the ones who use selective fishing gear presented a more conservation prone perception; nonselective fishermen and part-time fishermen were more flexible and adaptable to changes; and younger fishermen tended to agree more with the establishment of the MPAs. Taking these differences in perceptions among fishermen into account could serve as a basis for improvements in the management and conservation of fishing resources, besides helping predict possible future behavior due to changes in management policies.

Basin-scale distribution of harbour porpoises in the Baltic Sea provides basis for effective conservation actions,"Carlen, I; Thomas, L; Carlstrom, J; Amundin, M; Teilmann, J; Tregenza, N; Tougaard, J; Koblitz, JC; Sveegaard, S; Wennerberg, D; Loisa, O; Dahne, M; Brundiers, K; Kosecka, M; Kyhn, LA; Ljungqvist, CT; Pawliczka, I; Koza, R; Arciszewski, B; Galatius, A; Jabbusch, M; Laaksonlaita, J; Niemi, J; Lyytinen, S; Gallus, A; Benke, H; Blankett, P; Skora, KE; Acevedo-Gutierrez, A","Knowledge on spatial and seasonal distribution of species is crucial when designing protected areas and implementing management actions. The Baltic Proper harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) population is critically endangered, and its distribution is virtually unknown. Here, we used passive acoustic monitoring and species distribution models to describe the spatial and seasonal distribution of harbour porpoises in the Baltic Proper. Porpoise click detectors were deployed over a systematic grid of 297 stations in eight countries from April 2011 through July 2013. Generalized additive models were used to describe the monthly probability of detecting porpoise clicks as a function of spatially-referenced covariates and time. During the reproductive season, two main areas of high probability of porpoise detection were identified. One of those areas, situated on and around the offshore banks in the Baltic Proper, is clearly separated from the known distribution range of the Belt Sea population during breeding season, suggesting this is an important breeding ground for the Baltic Proper population. We commend the designation of this area as a marine protected area and recommend Baltic Sea countries to also protect areas in the southern Baltic Sea and the Hand Bight where additional important harbour porpoise habitats were identified. Further conservation measures should be carried out based on analyses of overlap between harbour porpoise distribution and potentially harmful anthropogenic activities. Our study shows that large-scale systematic monitoring using novel techniques can give important insights on the distribution of low-density populations, and that international cooperation is pivotal when studying transnationally migratory species.",2018,,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,226,,42-53,WOS:000445992900006,10.1016/j.biocon.2018.06.031,,#19365,Carlen 2018,,
"Conservation Strategies Through the Lens of Small-Scale Fishers in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador: Perceptions Underlying Local Resistance to Marine Planning","Burbano, DV; Meredith, TC","Spatial management tools are increasingly used in marine protected areas (MPAs). In the Galapagos Archipelago two zoning plans have been designed to advance resource management and protection: one in 2000, implemented through participatory processes under a co-management regime; the other in 2016, designed within a new regulatory framework and with strong input from international conservation advocates. The new zoning plan has been actively resisted by small-scale fishers. We analyze qualitative data from 149 questionnaire surveys and 16 key informant interviews to assess fishers' perceptions of the re-zoning process. The perceptions that underpin fishers' resistance to the new zoning plan converge in five principal themes that raise questions about the legitimacy, fairness, transparency, and viability of this management tool. This study provides further evidence of the strategic importance of incorporating human dimensions in MPA management and, more particularly, of understanding social concerns that may critically impede the progress of marine resource conservation.",2020,,SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES,33,10,1194-1212,WOS:000538993700001,10.1080/08941920.2020.1765058,,#19367,Burbano 2020,,
Assessing Assemblage Composition of Reproductively Mature Resource Fishes at a Community Based Subsistence Fishing Area (CBSFA),"Weible, RM; Rodgers, KS; Friedlander, AM; Hunter, CL","Nearshore fisheries in Hawai'i have been steadily decreasing for over a century. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been utilized as a method to both conserve biodiversity and enhance fisheries. The composition of resource fishes within and directly outside of the recently established Ha'ena Community Based Subsistence Fishing Area (CBSFA) on the island of Kaua'i were assessed to determine temporal and spatial patterns in assemblage structure. In situ visual surveys of fishes, invertebrates, and benthos were conducted using a stratified random sampling design to evaluate the efficacy of the MPA between 2016 and 2020. L-50 values-defined as the size at which half of the individuals in a population have reached reproductive maturity-were used as proxies for identifying reproductively mature resource fishes both inside and outside the CBSFA. Surveys between 2016 and 2020 did not indicate strong temporal or spatial changes in overall resource fish assemblage structure; however, some species-specific changes were evident. Although overall resource species diversity and richness were significantly higher by 2020 inside the MPA boundaries, there is currently no strong evidence for a reserve effect.",2021,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,13,3,,WOS:000633602200001,10.3390/d13030114,,#19369,Weible 2021,,
Effects of cooperation and different characteristics of Marine Protected Areas in a simulated small-scale fishery,"Owusu, KA; Acevedo-Trejos, E; Fall, MM; Merico, A","Marine fisheries are a critically important source of food, nutrition, and employment for millions of people. As the global population increases, new and expanding pressures are created on fish resources. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been widely promoted as valuable tools for rebuilding or maintaining fish stocks around the world. The success of MPAs, however, widely depends on their particular configuration and management and their effectiveness is often object of contentious debates in both scientific and political arenas. Since fisheries management is a collective action problem, some forms of human cooperation in terms of fishing behaviour can lead to sustainable fisheries and can represent, in theory, a complementary or even an alternative approach to the establishment of no-take marine reserves. We present here a new Agent-Based Model (ABM) that captures the main characteristics of an idealised small-scale fishery. We then use the model to investigate the combined effects of different fishing strategies (expressed by a cooperative trait associated to fishing effort) and various configurations of no-take reserves (including presence or absence of MPA, size of MPA, age of MPA, i.e. time elapsed since its establisment, and distance between two MPAs) on fish abundance and catch under an overfishing regime. Our results show that high cooperation without an MPA can be as effective as lower levels of cooperation combined with an MPA in maintaining fish stocks and catches at relatively high levels. The mobility of our fish agents implies that, contrary to current belief, these results may not be limited to sedentary species. We also found that the greatest impacts on fish abundance and catch are produced by the size of an MPA and the time elapsed since its establishment. Furthermore, the distance between two MPAs has no significant effect, regardless of the cooperation levels characterising the fishing agents. Despite its simplicity, the ABM presented here provides insights on the most plausible effects that combinations of different MPA designs and human cooperation strategies can produce on overexploited small-scale fisheries. When appropriately adapted with a realistic, fishery-specific parameterisation, this model can constitute a valuable tool for evaluating the impact of different resource management strategies. We make the model available as open-source software with the aims of fostering reproducibility, transparency, and flow of ideas.",2020,,ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,44,,,WOS:000599877200012,10.1016/j.ecocom.2020.100876,,#19372,Owusu 2020,,
Evaluating the social acceptability of Marine Protected Areas,"Gall, SC; Rodwell, LD","Q methodology provides a novel, quantitative approach to reveal stakeholder perspectives and was used to assess social acceptance of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) with fisheries and conservation management goals using the Devon & Severn region, UK as a case study site. Participants sorted a set of statements (n=42) into a forced-choice frequency distribution and centroid analysis revealed three factors for interpretation: (1) 'pro-conservation', characterised by views that conservation should be prioritised over commercial and economic interests; (2) 'pro-fisheries' who saw fishing as the priority and expressed concerns over the uncertainty of management measures and the number of planned MPAs; and (3) 'win-win' who felt that the current approach to marine management using MPAs would allow both fisheries and conservation goals to be met. Despite some differences in opinion, social acceptability of MPAs was identified across all three discourses, but was limited by the knock-on effects of the exclusion of stakeholders from the implementation of MPAs and the development of management measures. This resulted in disenfranchisement and uncertainty over the future of their activities. The results suggest that social acceptability of MPAs is generated by effective and ongoing stakeholder engagement, transparency and honesty relating to the costs and benefits of designations and a certainty that once sites are in place the resources exist for their effective management. Understanding social acceptability will guide adaptive management and increase the chances of MPA success and the meeting of global targets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Does It Work for Biodiversity? Experiences and Challenges in the Evaluation of Social Marketing Campaigns,"Verissimo, D; Bianchessi, A; Arrivillaga, A; Cadiz, FC; Mancao, R; Green, K","There is a growing realization among conservationists that human behavior is the main driver of all key threats to biodiversity and the environment. This realization has led to an escalation of the efforts to influence human behavior toward the adoption of more sustainable alternatives, more recently through the use of social marketing theory and tools. However, these initiatives have traditionally suffered from a lack of robust impact evaluation, which limits not only accountability but also a practitioner's ability to learn and improve over time. We evaluated three social marketing campaigns conducted in the Philippines, which aimed at increasing the sustainability of local fisheries. To achieve this, we used the results not only from questionnaire surveys but also from biological and enforcement data. We found that although there is some evidence of impact around human behavior and perceptions of conservation results, those changes did not translate into biological outcomes during the 2-year time frame considered in this evaluation. We discuss many of the barriers to causal inference that still remain, particularly if causal links between outcomes and specific interventions are to be drawn, but also showcase how this current methodology can help us go further than the more basic approaches to impact evaluation commonly used. Lastly, we highlight a number of lessons learned from this experience in seeking a practical, ethical, and effective approach to impact evaluation.",2018,,SOCIAL MARKETING QUARTERLY,24,1,18-34,WOS:000424284000002,10.1177/1524500417734806,,#19375,Verissimo 2018,,
A model-based assessment of reef larvae dispersal in the Western Indian Ocean reveals regional connectivity patterns - Potential implications for conservation policies,"Crochelet, E; Roberts, J; Lagabrielle, E; Obura, D; Petit, M; Chabanet, P","Marine resources are under increasing pressure from a wide variety of threats such as overfishing, offshore energy development, and climate change. As marine ecosystems degrade, so do the well-being and livelihoods of humans that depend directly on the ecosystem goods and services they provide. Marine protected areas have been proposed to protect biodiversity, restore damaged ecosystems, sustain fisheries, and rebuild overexploited stocks. The effectiveness of marine protected areas depends in part on their effectiveness as connected networks, linked over large areas by ecological processes such as larval dispersal. Here, we applied a biophysical model driven by ocean currents derived from satellite altimetry to evaluate connectivity between Western Indian Ocean reefs. We applied graph-theoretic analysis, including clustering and a betweenness centrality metric. Our results show high interconnectivity within several regions (Mozambique Channel, Mascarene archipelago) and lower connectivity across the WIO region. We compared the results with the current MPA network, and proposed sites/reefs that should be considered priority sites for MPA implementation: Pebane, Cosmoledo, Majunga, Masoarivo, Platte Island, Farquhar, Agalega and Geyser bank. Our results are timely, considering the oil and gas exploration that is ongoing in the region. We discuss implications for transboundary marine policies and regional cooperation in the Western Indian Ocean, and advocate the creation of a regional-scale organization to structure interactions among the different actors.

Predicting impact to assess the efficacy of community-based marine reserve design,"Smallhorn-West, PF; Bridge, TCL; Malimali, S; Pressey, RL; Jones, GP","During the planning phase the efficacy of different strategies to manage marine resources should ultimately be assessed by their potential impact, or ability to make a difference to ecological and social outcomes. While community-based and systematic approaches to establishing marine protected areas have their strengths and weaknesses, comparisons of their effectiveness often fail to explicitly address potential impact. Here, we predict conservation impact to compare recently implemented community-based marine reserves in Tonga to a systematic configuration specifically aimed at maximizing impact. Boosted regression tree outputs indicated that fishing pressure accounted for similar to 24% of variation in target species biomass. We estimate that the community-based approach provides 84% of the recovery potential of the configuration with the greatest potential impact. This high potential impact results from community-based reserves being located close to villages, where fishing pressure is greatest. These results provide strong support for community-based marine management, with short-term benefits likely to accrue even where there is little scope for systematic reserve design.",2019,,CONSERVATION LETTERS,12,1,,WOS:000458575500009,10.1111/conl.12602,,#19379,Smallhorn-West 2019,,
Marine protected areas in the eastern African region: How successful are they?,"Francis, J; Nilsson, A; Waruinge, D","This article reviews the governance and management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and the coral reefs they contain, in the eastern African Region. This includes the Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Tanzania, and the Seychelles. Three generations or categories of MPAs are distinguished: i) small areas for protection of a single species or unique marine habitat; ii) large multiple use MPAs designed for coastal development as well as biodiversity protection; and iii) MPAs managed by a nongovernmental organization (NGO) or the private sector. Each of these MPA types is examined according to the policies, legislation, and management systems they entail as well as the economic and community situation they operate within. The paper also provides a review of some eastern African MPAs in terms of their size and location, the type of MPA, zonation schemes, and financial status. The successes of the different types of MPAs are discussed based on specific indicators, such as changes in biodiversity, infrastructure, compliance to regulations and the level of involvement of primary stakeholders in the management. From the review it is clear that a fourth generation of MPAs may be forthcoming; community-based MPAs. Although lack of data makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of these different categories of MPAs, it is clear that no MPA can succeed without support of the local communities. Generally, the results of the analysis are promising for MPAs, however a lack of data is hampering a deeper analysis. The major issues facing MPAs in the region are highlighted, as well as some regional initiatives striving to address these issues. A number of recommendations are made, aiming to strengthen the establishment and management of MPAs in the eastern African region.",2002,,AMBIO,31,8-Jul,503-511,WOS:000180156800003,10.1639/0044-7447(2002)031[0503:MPAITE]2.0.CO;2,,#19381,Francis 2002,,
Examining the seascape of compliance in US Pacific island fisheries,"Ayers, AL; Leong, K","Noncompliance is a major threat to marine social-ecological systems. Recent noncompliance research has focused on illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fisheries and capacity shortfalls in marine protected areas (MPAs), but less work has assessed other aspects of noncompliance. Although there is wide recognition of the role of noncompliance in governance failures, the academic literature on compliance rarely acknowledges the connections between governance processes, compliance activities, and management outcomes. Likewise, scholars often highlight instrumental approaches that include law enforcement tools, instead of a diverse suite of non-instrumental interventions that encourage voluntary compliance through education, outreach, and targeted behavior change. We sought to understand the seascape of compliance across the United States Pacific islands region, an area of 5.83 million km(2) that includes Hawai'i, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and one of the world's largest MPAs. The region includes commercial, subsistence, and non-commercial fisheries, and a diversity of cultures that rely on them. To examine compliance, we employed a qualitative approach, including an extensive review of historical and archival data sources, an analysis of the fisheries management literature in the region, and 29 expert interviews. While the literature highlighted the importance of enforcement, experts called attention to multiple factors that affected compliance, such as capacity, governance processes, and a lack of data. Although several fisheries may benefit from an increased enforcement presence, we argue that non-instrumental and governance approaches can complement enforcement and should be part of an integrated compliance approach both in the region and worldwide.",2020,,MARINE POLICY,115,,,WOS:000528256400028,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.103820,,#19382,Ayers 2020,,

While various indicators have been proposed to assess effectiveness of individual MPAs, no comprehensive set of indicators exists for MPA networks, particularly for Aichi Target 11. The qualitative elements of this target recognize the value of social, economic, governance, and ecological factors in achieving effective biodiversity conservation. Here, we used a systematic literature review to identify indicators of MPA network effectiveness. We reviewed 64 publications, identifying 48 indicators that could be aligned with the qualitative elements. Results showed that assessments of MPA network effectiveness predominantly focused on effective management while neglecting equitable management and integration into the wider land and seascape. Indicators tended to focus on ecological characteristics, overlooking social, economic, and governance dimensions. Key challenges in addressing these gaps include identifying conflicting priorities and objectives in adjacent marine and land areas that interfere with cooperation and knowledge sharing, and ensuring diverse areas with distinct social and ecological contexts are considered.

Measuring what matters - Identifying indicators of success for Brazilian marine protected areas,"Oliveira, JGC; Ladle, RJ; Correia, R; Batista, VS","The large increase in number and extent of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) over the last few decades has been an important step towards the conservation of marine environments. However, it is not clear whether these important conservation tools are effectively managed, especially in the developing world where resources are limited and there are frequent conflicts with traditional resource users. An innovative approach was used to identify the most important governance, socioeconomic and biophysical variables that are associated with the management effectiveness of Brazilian MPAs. Management effectiveness data was extracted from Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Areas Management (RAPPAM), applied by World Wildlife Fund Brazil in 2005 and 2010. This comprehensive dataset was summarized in a single management effectiveness metric and related to a set of 15 explanatory variables using generalized linear models (GLMs). An innovative multi-model averaging approach was employed to identify the most important variables relating to management effectiveness. As a result, five main indicators showed high influence on management effectiveness: 1) higher levels of monitoring/research; 2) higher investment; 3) greater human resources; 4) greater social participation, and; 5) lower levels of conflicts between users and managers. managerial effectiveness of Brazilian MPAs could be significantly improved by adopting an indicator based approach to management prioritization.

"Understanding the spatial diversity of social uses, dynamics, and conflicts in marine spatial planning","Noble, MM; Harasti, D; Pittock, J; Doran, B","Marine coastal environments are often socially complex public areas that need equitable spatial planning approaches. Understanding the extent of extractive and non-extractive uses and the social dynamics that may be driving patterns of use is essential if the spatial plan is to support the social resilience of a marine area. In this study, a combination of fuzzy-set multi-criteria GIS modelling and negative tie social network analysis were used to explore social uses and conflicts based on sketch-mapping interviews with five key stakeholder groups (ecotourism, Aboriginal Traditional Owners, commercial and recreational fishing, and water sports) within a Marine Protected Area (MPA). Most of the areas within the MPA were regularly used by the stakeholders, with non-extractive and extractive stakeholders occupying similar spatial extents, with each stakeholder group having a different pattern of use. However, stakeholder groups had different levels of perceived priority to access these areas and support of the current spatial management plan, especially within the ecotourism and Aboriginal Traditional Owner groups. The investigation of social conflicts in shaping patterns of use revealed that most stakeholder conflicts do not necessarily occur in areas of overlaps, but generally in areas of high biodiversity and easy access through marine infrastructure. Ecotourism groups had the most perceived conflicts over marine space, which shaped their use towards certain no-take zones that protected high biodiversity and would also provide protection from other conflicting stakeholder uses (e.g., boating, fishing). Overall, the method outlined in this paper presents a way for marine spatial management to consider not only the extent and diversity of social uses in a marine environment but also the spatial-social dynamics that may determine the success of the spatial plan in supporting long-term social resilience.",2019,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,246,,929-940,WOS:000482246700091,10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.06.048,,#19385,Noble 2019,,

Practicality of marine protected areas - Can there be solutions for the River Indus delta?,"Kidwai, S; Fanning, P; Ahmed, W; Tabrez, M; Zhang, J; Khan, MW","The River Indus delta is the most prominent feature on the Pakistan coast. Owing to its prominence, mangrove ecosystem, historical, ecological and economic significance it is also a proposed Marine Protected Area (MPA). Currently there are no designated MPAs in Pakistan.This paper presents findings of the Fishery Resource Appraisal Project of Pakistan (FRAPP) a fishery stock assessment carried out for the pelagic and demersal fishery resource of Pakistan from 2009 to 2015 and the Creek Survey Program (CSP) which was part of FRAPP. And discusses how the delta suffers from physical stress.The observations from FRAPP indicates deterioration in the mangrove ecosystem, that are evident in the form of loss of biodiversity and biological productivity. The 600 observations from 10 major creeks showed that trawl catches were a mix of generally small size fish and shrimp. Catches averaged less than 1 kg per tow in all the creeks sampled. Catch weights were somewhat higher in Isaro, WadiKhuddi, Paitiani, Dabbo, Richaal Creeks all of which were near mangrove areas and open sea. The most frequently occurring species of shrimps caught in the trawls belonged to 7 major taxa. The Khobar Creek and Upper Wari Creek are notable for the high rates of occurrence of every group except the Caridea. They are also the only two creeks where the freshwater family Paleomonidae is common. The size composition of the important penaeid family of shrimps in all study areas combined suggests that the smallest shrimps (0.5 -1.5 cm carapace length CL) enter the creeks in February/March and adults (5-6 cm CL) move out again 6-12 months later. Four species of Penaeus (monodon, japonicus, semisulcatus, merguiensis), two species of Metapenaeus (monoceros, affinis), Parapeneoposis stylifera and Solenosera sp. were caught, all in low abundance, less than 0.5 Kg tow(-1).The shrimp catches in the area off the Sindh coast, the catches averaged 4.30 +/- 13.40 kg h(-1) on the inner shelf (20-50 m) and 1.7 +/- 6.6 kg h(-1) on the outer shelf (51-200 m). Further east, on the Kori bank, the shrimp catch averaged 4.40 +/- 6.6 kg h(-1) (inner shelf) and 1.7 +/- 6.6 kg h(-1) (outer shelf). Penaeus spp. were more abundant in the inshore and Metapenaeus spp. on the outer shelf.The creeks that have a direct connection to the sea and support a natural mangrove stand are significantly more productive than the smaller creeks. Scientific and management questions have arisen that are addressed in order to help revive the delta and hope that this results in a spillover effect that will spread on to the shelf areas.Fisher communities depend heavily on the delta and coastal waters and its natural resources for their livelihood. Their participation and ownership on the resource is over generations, and therefore their involvement is key to proposing any management and conservation initiatives. The study proposes how the delta and its ecosystem in parts should be protected and why and how it is a prime candidate for being declared nationally as protected. This paper proposes a way forward.

"Effects of small, Fijian community-based marine protected areas on exploited reef fishes","Clements, C; Bonito, V; Grober-Dunsmore, R; Sobey, M","No-take marine protected areas (MPAs) are commonly applied in community-based management schemes to sustain and enhance coral-reef fisheries. However, many MPAs in Fiji and the South Pacific are relatively small (<= 1 km(2)), and few data exist regarding the effects of these MPAs on populations of exploited species. We used hook-and-line fishing surveys to assess whether 4 relatively small (<1 km(2)) community-based MPAs in Fiji (3 current, 1 former) were providing any commonly sought benefits to exploited reef-fish stocks. All of the MPAs had maintained no-take status for over 4 yr, although the former MPA was opened to fishing 4 mo before this study. The current MPAs exhibited significantly greater catch and biomass per unit effort, individual fish biomass, and/or percentage of reproductive-size fish than paired, adjacent fished areas, while this was not the case with the former MPA. Sites with intact MPAs also exhibited greater catch diversity than the former MPA site. Additionally, tag and recapture data from the 17 recaptured of 2650 tagged fish suggest site fidelity of these fishes, although fishes initially captured in the MPA at all 4 sites were later caught in fished areas, indicating that there is movement of fishes from the MPAs to fished areas. While the combination of these findings supports the utility of even relatively small MPAs as effective tools for the conservation of certain target species, it also suggests that MPA benefits may be quickly depleted and that even closures of extended duration may be insufficient for long-term fisheries management if the MPAs are not maintained.",2012,,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,449,,233-243,WOS:000301231500019,10.3354/meps09554,,#19389,Clements 2012,,
Assessing Indicators and Limitations of Food Security Objectives in Coral Reef Restoration,"Vandenberg, J; Humphries, A; Garcia-Quijanoa, C; Moore, A; Pollnac, R; Abdullah, S","Coral reef restoration is often presented as a marine conservation solution that provides 'win-win' outcomes. However, most studies on reef restoration have focused on the biological success, while little is known about whether social objectives are ever achieved. This study investigates a reef restoration initiative in the Spermonde archipelago, Indonesia, where food security was initially presented as an intended social outcome. We utilised an ethnographic mixed-methods approach to investigate: 1) perceived sociocultural benefits of coral restoration to the local community; 2) impacts of reef restoration on local food security; and 3) local sociocultural barriers and limitations of reef restoration as a mechanism for improving food security. We found fish contributed to food security primarily as an income source to purchase food. Local people mainly valued nearby reefs for storm protection. Furthermore, most fishers are organised through patron-client systems that target pelagic species; therefore they currently have minimal dependency on adjacent reefs. However, fishing restrictions linked to the restoration programme still negatively impacted both pelagic fishers and a small population of reef-based fishers-indirectly by damaging reciprocal fishing relations with neighbouring islands and directly by limiting access to local reefs. Complex social and trade networks associated with patron-client networks present potential barriers for transitioning to reef-based fisheries and eradicating the use of destructive fishing gear, therefore limiting access to potential food security benefits generated from reef restoration. These findings show that the relationship between coral restoration and food security is tenuous and cannot be assumed. These findings also demonstrate that social dynamics surrounding community-based conservation initiatives are complex and context-dependent, and such details must be considered when designing marine habitat restoration initiatives.",2021,,CONSERVATION & SOCIETY,19,1,68-79,WOS:000621017300008,10.4103/cs.cs_20_33,,#19390,Vandenberg 2021,,
Creating Stable Agreements in Marine Policy: Learning from the California South Coast Marine Life Protection Act Initiative,"McCreary, S; Grifman, P; Cowart, M","In this article, we examine the California South Coast Marine Life Protection Act Initiative stakeholder process, evaluate its shortcomings, and consider what could have been done differently. Our objective is to make recommendations to improve future multi-stakeholder marine policy processes. In our view, while the South Coast stakeholder process had many positive outcomes, it failed to reach what we call here a ""stable agreement."" Our analysis is based on two of the authors' involvement ( one as a facilitator and the other as a stakeholder representative) in the process and a post-hoc survey of participants. We find that several ill-advised process design and management choices significantly destabilized the negotiations, leading to an ultimately unstable agreement.We highlight four major problematic process design and management decisions, including the following: representation on the multistakeholder group was imbalanced, the pre-meeting caucuses were not paired with training in interest-based negotiation, adequate incentives to negotiate toward a consensus agreement were not provided, and the use of straw voting at one point in the process was unclear and inconsistent. As a result of these and other process design and management flaws, many stakeholders believed that the process was biased and that their ends would be better achieved by anchoring negotiations and engaging in positional bargaining. Ultimately, this meant that near-consensus on a single cross-interest marine protected area proposal was not reached, the scientific guidelines put forth were not fully met, the process was not and is not viewed as fair by the stakeholders directly or indirectly involved, and the marine protected area regulations lack broad-scale support.These pitfalls of the South Coast stakeholder process could have been avoided had the management and facilitation team consistently followed best practices in dispute resolution. We recommend that future marine planning processes learn from this example, particularly those occurring in highly complex, urban ocean environments.",2016,,NEGOTIATION JOURNAL,32,1,23-48,WOS:000374504900003,10.1111/nejo.12145,,#19391,McCreary 2016,,
Enhancing Uptake of Nature-Based Solutions for Informing Coastal Sustainable Development Policy and Planning: A Malaysia Case Study,"Chee, SY; Firth, LB; Then, AYH; Yee, JC; Mujahid, A; Affendi, YA; Amir, AA; Lau, CM; Ooi, JLS; Quek, YA; Tan, CE; Yap, TK; Yeap, CA; McQuatters-Gollop, A","Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have been advocated to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. The uptake of NbS differs regionally with some countries exhibiting greater uptake than others. The success of NbS also differs regionally with varying environmental conditions and social-ecological processes. In many regions, the body of knowledge, particularly around the efficacy of such efforts, remains fragmented. Having an ""inventory"" or ""tool box"" of regionally-trialed methods, outcomes and lessons learnt can improve the evidence base, inform adaptive management, and ultimately support the uptake of NbS. Using Malaysia as a case study, we provide a comprehensive overview of trialed and tested NbS efforts that used nature to address societal challenges in marine and coastal environments (here referring to mangroves, seagrass, coral reefs), and detailed these efforts according to their objectives, as well as their anticipated and actual outcomes. The NbS efforts were categorized according to the IUCN NbS approach typology and mapped to provide a spatial overview of IUCN NbS effort types. A total of 229 NbS efforts were collated, representing various levels of implementation success. From the assessment of these efforts, several key actions were identified as a way forward to enhance the uptake of Nature-based Solutions for informing coastal sustainable development policy and planning. These include increasing education, training, and knowledge sharing; rationalizing cooperation across jurisdictions, laws, and regulations; enhancing environmental monitoring; leveraging on existing policies; enabling collaboration and communication; and implementing sustainable finance instruments.

Cultural ecosystem services: Linking landscape and social attributes to ecotourism in protected areas,"Pinheiro, RO; Triest, L; Lopes, PFM","Assessment of cultural ecosystem services (CES) and the negative impacts humans can have on them can provide essential information toward conservation and management strategies. Globally, tourism and recreational CES are among the most relevant economic and social activities, with ecotourism in particular growing rapidly in places with high cultural heritage and high biodiversity, such as many protected areas. This study used a combination of GIS-based methods and interviews in a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Brazil called Extractive Reserve Acau-Goiana to investigate whether its users (i.e., visitors and local residents) prefer some CES over others and whether recreational coastal activities can be affected by different factors and human-caused stressors, such as 'scariness', 'unpleasantness', and 'noisiness'. All assessed CES were identified by respondents to be provided in the MPA. 'Aesthetic values' and 'social relations' were the most commonly identified CES, whereas 'scariness' and 'unpleasantness' were the main stressors. Respondents also showed a preference for specific areas within the MPA, such as beaches and mangroves.

A social-ecological approach to estimate fisher resilience: a case study from Brazil,"Silva, MR; Pennino, MG; Lopes, PFM","Social-ecological systems (SESs), such as fishing communities, are human and biophysical subsystems that are intrinsically connected to one another and strongly depend on natural resources. That is why these human groups are usually the first to feel the effects of policies concerning fisheries and ocean governance and the most affected by them. These policies can potentially build or erode social-ecological resilience (SER), especially if they are coupled with environmental changes. SER assessments offer a valuable tool to identify human-nature linkages, and the implications and feedbacks in SESs when facing human-induced or natural changes. We created a SER index by combining interviews with fishers with environmental datasets on a fine scale that has never been presented for the Brazilian coast. This scale was then tested in marine protected areas that allow sustainable use. Our approach estimated SER from information on fisheries ecosystem services and adaptive capacity at the local scale, considering the individual and community levels. We synthesized blocks of critical indicators of an individual or community's ability to build and maintain resilience in SESs, such as flexibility, ability to learn, ability to organize, assets, social capital, and ecological characteristics. We identified that fishers' ability to learn and to organize, as well as the biological sensitivity of an ecosystem are determinant to enhancing SER in the studied coastal communities. A Bayesian model also showed that the fishers' SER was related to socioeconomic factors, thereby indicating that older fishers, fishers who consistently catch more fish, and fishers with a higher reliance on fishing for their income presented lower index values. By knowing the variables that influence the ability of fishers to cope with changes to their SESs, we can devise smarter management approaches that may include compensatory mechanisms for more fragile fishers. Our findings can also inform decision making about where fisheries management strategies are likely to be more participative and effective in order to minimize the social impacts of policy decisions and increase SER in coastal communities.",2020,,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,25,1,,WOS:000524149700018,10.5751/ES-11361-250123,,#19399,Silva 2020,,

The generation of social and environmental benefits that are equitably distributed among constituencies is a key factor in ICM process sustainability. Participatory processes, while challenging to manage and under growing scrutiny, remain the most effective manner to engage broad constituencies and ensure that benefits match expectations. The scaling up of many local initiatives in the Philippines and Indonesia is well underway and warrants ongoing support and monitoring. Attention must be paid to legal and institutional frameworks that support integrative planning on local and national scales. Impartial and rigorous research on ICM is offered as a way to support these changes and to assess future challenges and emerging management models. While frequently a volatile process, the authors conclude by affirming their commitment to ICM as a potent and balanced planning process. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

From sea sharing to sea sparing - Is there a paradigm shift in ocean management?,"Wolff, M","During the past decade, the apocalyptic rhetoric of dwindling ocean resources and the destruction of aquatic habitats in the ocean and along our coasts has motivated conservationist, scientists, international Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and several coastal states to advocate the separation of ever increasing ocean and coastal areas as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to allow for the restoration of the ocean and its resources. At the same time, and analogue to what is happening with industrial agriculture, large industrial fishing fleets are operating in the Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZ's) of foreign countries, extracting a substantial part of their valuable ocean resources for the world market. The sparing of ocean and shelf areas for both, MPA implementation and Distant Water fishing (DWF) has impacted (positively and negatively) the concerned ecosystems and has often caused use conflicts with local stakeholders. I argue that current ocean use and conservation strategies are favouring these ocean-sparing (""blue grabbing"") measures as necessary means for ocean protection and sea food production over the science-based sustainable fisheries management approach, which is based on participatory fisheries assessment and the inclusion of local stakeholders in the management process. I perceive this change from sea sharing to sea sparing approaches as a paradigm shift in ocean management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Incorporating ecosystem objectives into management of sustainable marine fisheries, including 'best practice' reference points and use of marine protected areas","Sainsbury, K; Sumaila, UR","The broadening of fisheries management to include ecosystem-related objectives raises a potentially confusing range of possible issues for consideration in management decisions, in reporting and in assessing management performance. However, there are methods available and approaches to addressing the issues that are practical, accessible to stakeholder participation and scientifically assessable. Three broad and interrelated elements are described that allow ecosystem objectives to be practically and operationally incorporated into marine fisheries management systems.Reporting and assessment of the whole management system against sustainability objectivesThree major points are developed and emphasized:1. Indicators and reference points - and consequently performance measures - must relate explicitly to the high-level objectives of management.2. The structure and focus of reports on sustainability must be derived transparently from the high-level objectives. A methodology for this is described that can be used in meetings with stakeholders to elucidate the issues, indicators and reference points, management response and the justification for decisions. It can include risk-based methods to help identify the relative importance of different issues.3. Performance assessment must be of the management system as a whole, rather than solely on the merits of particular parts in isolation. An established methodology (management strategy evaluation) is described that can be used to test quantitatively the likely performance of different management strategies in achieving ecosystem objectives. A management strategy in this context is a combination of monitoring, use of the monitoring data for assessment against reference points, identification of appropriate management measures and implementation of these measures. This methodology can be used to test any aspect of the strategy in the 'common currency'of the management objectives, and to identify the circumstances in which particular strategies are likely to perform well or fail. It has already been used in fisheries in relation to target species, important by-catch species, predator-prey dependencies and seabed habitats.Indicators, reference points and performance measures for fisheries ecosystem objectivesThere are many options available, and some recent summaries are identified. A set of target and limit reference points for fisheries ecosystem objectives are provided. These are based broadly on experience to date, and could be practically implemented in the short term. It is not claimed that these reference points are necessary or adequate to achieve sustainability for fisheries and marine ecosystems. Rather, they represent a practical and emerging 'best practice' means of operationally accommodating ecosystem-related objectives in fisheries management.Use of marine protected areas to achieve ecosystem objectives in fisheries managementFisheries have long used some forms of spatial management, such as closure of nursery areas to protect juvenile fish, but more recently there has been a focus on use of marine protected areas (MPAs) to achieve fishery objectives for the target species and for the ecosystem more generally.MPAs hold promise as a rational and practical way of managing ocean resources to achieve fishery ecosystem objectives, although this promise should not be overstated. MPAs are best seen as part of a collection of management tools and measures, with a combination of on-reserve and off-reserve measures being used together to achieve sustainable fisheries and marine ecosystems. Several new technological developments are making their design and management more practical. These recent developments are reviewed.",2003,,RESPONSIBLE FISHERIES IN THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM,,,343-361,WOS:000227034800020,10.1079/9780851996332.0343,,#19407,Sainsbury 2003,,
Integrated conservation and development: evaluating a community-based marine protected area project for equality of socioeconomic impacts,"Gurney, GG; Pressey, RL; Cinner, JE; Pollnac, R; Campbell, SJ","Despite the prevalence of protected areas, evidence of their impacts on people is weak and remains hotly contested in conservation policy. Akey question in this debate is whether socioeconomic impacts vary according to social subgroup. Given that social inequity can create conflict and impede poverty reduction, understanding how protected areas differentially affect people is critical to designing them to achieve social and biological goals. Understanding heterogeneous responses to protected areas can improve targeting of management activities and help elucidate the pathways through which impacts of protected areas occur. Here, we assessed whether the socioeconomic impacts of marine protected areas (MPAs)-designed to achieve goals for both conservation and poverty alleviation-differed according to age, gender or religion in associated villages in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using data from pre-, mid- and post-implementation of the MPAs for control and project villages, we found little empirical evidence that impacts on five key socioeconomic indicators related to poverty differed according to social subgroup. We found suggestive empirical evidence that the effect of the MPAs on environmental knowledge differed by age and religion; over the medium and long terms, younger people and Muslims showed greater improvements compared with older people and Christians, respectively.",2015,,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,370,1681,,WOS:000362720200009,10.1098/rstb.2014.0277,,#19409,Gurney 2015,,
Whale sanctuaries - An analysis of their contribution to marine ecosystem-based management,"Cook, D; Malinauskaite, L; Roman, J; Daviosdottir, B; Ogmundardottir, H","Goal 14, 'Life Below Water', of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals sets a target for nations to increase the number of marine protected areas managed using ecosystem-based management, which requires interventions focused on fish stock conservation and enhancement, environmental sustainability and ecosystem services of benefit to human beings. Although not adhering to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's criteria for marine protected areas, whale sanctuaries are an increasingly common approach to conservation around the world. This paper is the first in the academic literature to use a case study approach to review the extent to which whale sanctuaries contribute to ecosystem-based management. A fifteen-criteria framework for marine ecosystem-based management is applied with reference to six whale sanctuary case studies, including the International Whaling Commission's two designations in the Indian Ocean and Southern Ocean. The review underscores the generally very limited contribution of whale sanctuaries to ecosystem-based management, unless they are explicit in stating conservation goals and embedding these within iterative management plans. The Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary is cited as an example of an approach that comes closest to fulfilling the objectives of ecosystem-based management, albeit its designation lacks consideration of ecosystem dynamics and the interrelationships between multiple economic actors operating within its boundaries. In order to meet the requirements of Goal 14, the case studies in this paper reveal advancements necessary for whale sanctuaries to transition towards ecosystem-based management: establishment of objectives broader than the conservation of whale stocks, assessment of the contribution of the sanctuary to human well-being and trade-offs in ecosystem services, accounting for ecological and socio-economic dynamics, and ensuring broad stakeholder consultation and participatory adaptive management.",2019,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,182,,,WOS:000498753700022,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104987,,#19410,Cook 2019,,

When is a marine protected area network ecologically coherent? A case study from the North-east Atlantic,"Johnson, D; Ardron, J; Billett, D; Hooper, T; Mullier, T; Chaniotis, P; Ponge, B; Corcoran, E","1. Creating representative networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) as part of an ecosystem-based management approach is generally advocated to protect the full spectrum of marine ecosystems and vulnerable species. Core objectives for designing MPA networks incorporate issues of scale, size and spacing. Ascertaining when such objectives have been met, and thus when a network can be judged to be ecologically coherent, presents an ongoing challenge. This paper presents a broad-scale approach to assess the degree of ecological coherence within one such network.2. In 2013 an independent ecological coherence assessment was requested by OSPAR, the Regional Seas Convention for the North-east Atlantic, of the ecological coherence of its regional MPA network. As is often the case in the marine environment, the data were not sufficiently comprehensive or spatially inclusive to allow for a thorough assessment for the entire region. Consequently two levels of testing were applied: (1) basic tests applied to the whole OSPAR maritime area; and (2) a more sophisticated second level of tests directed at specific OSPAR regions and subregions for which more complete datasets were available. The former considered major gaps based on basic distribution thresholds and representativity (both biogeographic and bathymetric). The latter focused on broad-scale habitat presence to determine replication, adequacy and connectivity.3. On the basis of these tests it was concluded that while the OSPAR MPA network as a whole is not ecologically coherent, nonetheless significant progress towards global targets, such as protection of 10% of marine and coastal environments under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has been made. Gaps in the distribution of MPAs were identified, particularly under-representation of certain biogeographic provinces and bathymetric zones of depths greater than 75m including bathyal (200-3000m) and abyssal (3000-6000m) depths.4. To address such gaps, a cooperative region by region approach will be required by the OSPAR Parties to identify where positioning new MPAs can enhance ecological coherence.5. A limitation of the 2013 assessment was that it did not consider which MPAs are designated and managed for the protection of specific features; rather, it assumed that all features that fall within an MPA are protected. With a redevelopment of the OSPAR MPA database underway it is hoped that reporting of such details by Parties will improve, allowing for more specificity in future analyses. However, as the first such assessment of its kind our two-level approach serves as a case study of a pragmatic example of how assessments of ecologically coherent networks might be undertaken using GIS to contribute to systematic conservation planning.

Evaluating the success of a marine protected area: A systematic review approach,"Gallacher, J; Simmonds, N; Fellowes, H; Brown, N; Gill, N; Clark, W; Biggs, C; Rodwell, LD","Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), marine areas in which human activities are restricted, are implemented worldwide to protect the marine environment. However, with a large proportion of these MPAs being no more than paper parks, it is important to be able to evaluate MPA success, determined by improvements to biophysical, socio-economic and governance conditions. In this study a systematic literature review was conducted to determine the most frequently used indicators of MPA success. These were then applied to a case study to demonstrate how success can be evaluated. The fifteen most frequently used indicators included species abundance, level of stakeholder participation and the existence of a decision making and management body. Using the indicator framework with a traffic light system, we demonstrate how an MPA can be evaluated in terms of how well it performs against the indicators using secondary data from,the literature. The framework can be used flexibly. For example, where no MPA data currently exist, the framework can be populated by qualitative data provided by local stakeholder knowledge. This system provides a cost-effective and straightforward method for managers and decision -makers to determine the level of success of any MPA and identify areas of weakness. However, given the variety of motivations for MPA establishment, this success needs to be determined in the context of the original management objectives of the MPA with greater weighting being placed on those objectives where appropriate.

Drawing on close observations, interviews with a variety of participants, and document analysis, we conclude that the dictum that the new BBNJ agreement ""should not undermine"" existing elements of the ocean governance regime serves to inhibit movement towards a consensual and effective instrument.",2019,,MARINE POLICY,108,,,WOS:000495518700032,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103664,,#19421,Mendenhall 2019,,
The role of science in supporting marine protected area network planning and design in California,"Saarman, E; Gleason, M; Ugoretz, J; Airame, S; Carr, M; Fox, E; Frimodig, A; Mason, T; Vasques, J","Marine protected areas (MPAs) can be an effective tool for marine conservation, especially if conservation goals are clearly identified and MPAs are designed in accordance with ecological principles to meet those goals. In California (USA), the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) Initiative led four regional public planning processes to design a statewide network of MPAs. The MLPA planning processes were carefully structured to provide a clearly-defined and important role for science and scientists. Over 50 scientists contributed directly to this MPA planning effort as members of a Science Advisory Team or in other capacities. Stakeholders were charged with developing alternative MPA proposals in each region, while scientists served as advisors and evaluated MPA proposals against science-based guidelines. Four key conditions supported the successful integration of science into the MPA network planning effort. First, the MLPA legislation provided a strong legal mandate for the use of the best readily available science and policy-makers strongly supported scientific input and the use of science-based MPA design guidelines. Second, the structure of the public planning process clearly identified the role of scientists and enabled a transparent and participatory process that promoted the use of science. Third, simple science-based MPA design guidelines provided benchmarks for assessing the likely effectiveness of alternative MPA proposals at achieving MLPA goals. Finally, scientists were engaged extensively and were responsive to the evolving informational needs of each regional MPA planning process. The redesigned statewide network of MPAs generally reflects the successful integration of science and science-based MPA design guidelines into a public policy process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Scaling Up to Networks of Marine Protected Areas in the Philippines: Biophysical, Legal, Institutional, and Social Considerations","Lowry, GK; White, AT; Christie, P","The growing number of marine protected areas (MPAs) globally represents an increasing interest in marine conservation and fisheries management and the potential of planned and managed MPA networks as a way of strengthening local management. This study documents the development of MPA networks in the Philippines and identifies critical success factors and issues. Methods were field observation by participation in MPA and fisheries management projects and focused interviews that gathered opinions and observations of primary MPA network stakeholders in the central Visayas region. Findings show that an MPA network is defined through social and ecological criteria. From a social perspective, a network is comprised of people and organizations that manage component MPAs, benefit from the network, and promote the network's viability through shared administrative responsibility and information. To qualify as part of an ecological network, individual MPAs must interact ecologically (e.g., source or sink of larvae and propagating organisms, protection for habitat, and threatened or endangered species) to enhance fisheries and biodiversity conservation. The study found that while social and ecological criteria are shaping MPA networks through science-based planning, integrated management, and coordination, there exist numerous institutional issues related to scaling up to networks from single MPAs. Issues pertain to: limiting access to resources, boundary delineation, monitoring compliance, finding common goals and identity, and conflict resolution. Factors correlated with management success included common institutional processes and legal support, improved understanding of benefits from a network and improved habitat conditions and fishery yields associated with MPAs.",2009,,COASTAL MANAGEMENT,37,4-Mar,274-290,WOS:000265291800005,10.1080/08920750902851146,,#19423,Lowry 2009,,
Restoration of Hong Kong fisheries through deployment of artificial reefs in marine protected areas,"Wilson, KDP; Leung, AWY; Kennish, R","We provide details of a restoration programme to restore Hong Kong's marine ecosystems and fisheries through the deployment of artificial reefs (AR) within marine parks and fishery-protected areas (EPA). The programme is being implemented in two phases. The first phase has involved AR deployment in recently established marine parks. The second phase will involve the establishment of FPA selected specifically for their suitability for AR deployment and fisheries restoration. Prior to site selection, a comprehensive two-stage consultation exercise was conducted, which targeted fishers, marine users and green groups. Ecosystem simulations were employed to assess the potential benefits to fisheries arising from the implementation of the second phase. Modelling results indicate that AR deployment, utilizing 10-20% of local waters managed predominantly as no-take zones, could arrest the current decline in fisheries yield and produce significant improvements within ten years. Limited selective fishing may be authorized at a small number of AR to encourage support from local fishers and facilitate enforcement. Successful implementation must involve a high level of fishing compliance within the 'no-take' zones. Management should be facilitated by establishing community-based advisory groups for each EPA that will comprise representatives from fishers, government and academics. They will be responsible, in addition to providing advice, for assisting with management issues including fishing permit allocation. The benefits and problems associated with different restoration initiatives are discussed. (C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Evaluating stakeholder participatory processes in policy development for Marine Protected Areas,"Rasheed, AR; Abdulla, A","This paper evaluates two stakeholder participatory workshops (local communities and tourism stakeholder) to support the development of a management plan for South Ari Atoll Marine Protected Area (SAMPA), Maldives. SAMPA is the largest MPA in the country declared by Maldives to preserve one of the largest whale shark aggregations in the world. However, to date it exists with no management plan to date. The objective of the workshops was to consult with stakeholders on a range of potential regulatory and governance mechanisms proposed for the MPA that can be included in a potential management plan. The paper finds that the two stakeholder workshops had, both functional and dysfunctional aspects that influenced the potential design of a management plan for SAMPA. Overall, the workshops represented a clear opportunity for collective learning and collaboration that fostered dialogue and deliberation. However, important and influential stakeholders were under-represented at the workshops. Furthermore, a reluctance of government to demonstrate how the outcomes of the workshop would be integrated in its decision-making left many participants feeling sceptical about the fairness, equity and effectiveness of the processes that would follow. With no management plan to date, this paper proposes that any future stakeholder process in SAMPA should be underpinned by well informed governance and regulatory options that have the support and commitment of the government which can ensure SAMPA's ecosystem services are sustained to benefit long-term human well-being.",2020,,MARINE POLICY,112,,,WOS:000515208000017,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103737,,#19426,Rasheed 2020,,
Human migration and marine protected areas: Insights from Vezo fishers in Madagascar,"Cripps, G; Gardner, CJ","Human migration may negatively impact biodiversity and is expected to increase in future, yet the phenomenon remains poorly understood by conservation managers. We conducted a mixed-methods investigation of a contemporary migration of traditional fishers in western Madagascar, a country which has been expanding its protected area system through the establishment of both strict and multiple-use sites, and critically evaluate different models of marine protected area in light of our findings. Interviews with fishers in major destination areas revealed that most migrants come from southwest Madagascar, use non-motorised vessels, and principally target sharks and sea cucumbers. Drivers of the migration include both push and pull factors (i.e. declining resource availability in areas of origin and the continued availability of lucrative resources for export to China). Traditional fisher migrants cause limited social conflict with residents and a number of environmental problems in destination areas: however artisanal fishers with motorised vessels probably represent a greater threat to marine resources than migrants, due to their greater harvesting capacity. We suggest that multiple-use arrangements may, be more appropriate than strict protected areas in both source and destination areas, because they integrate the interests of migrants rather than marginalising them: however seascape-scale management provides the best approach for managing the threats and opportunities provided by the migration at the appropriate scale.

"Capacity building for tourism development in a nested social-ecological system-A case study of the South Penghu Archipelago Marine National Park, Taiwan","Wu, CC; Tsai, HM","In subnational small-island settings with a relatively undisturbed natural environment and an out migration population, tourism development is often used as an alternative development strategy for economic and social regeneration. When such tourism development entails place-based management, such as in a marine protected area (MPA), tourism development can also be used as a strategy for alleviating the conflict between conservation and development as well as for increasing community participation. Local support and capacity building prior to tourism development are essential for involving local communities. Local communities are often complex and heterogeneous, and tourism development must be tailored to match their diverse needs. In this case study, three communities within the South Penghu Archipelago, where a marine national park and development of the tourism industry has been proposed, were investigated. This study assessed the perception of tourism development among community actors and the demands for capacity building to cope with future changes by conducting a social ecological system (SES) analysis wherein the South Penghu MPA was considered a nested SES composed of subsystems. The subsystems focused on in this study were fishermen and nonfishermen at the functional scale and individual communities at the spatial scale. The results showed that the perceptions on tourism development varied substantially among the community actors and the different sub-SESs because of their different experiences in social ecological interactions. Therefore, tourism development in a regional place-based management, such as in a MPA, must consider the various perceptions of such subsystems on tourism development. Rather than considering all local communities as a general unit, capacity building should be tailored to the needs of the community actors from the various sub-SESs. In addition, support from governmental agencies is essential for the success of community-based MPA policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, most evaluations of their efficacy use only a narrow set of conservation indicators that reflect a fraction of ways in which protection can succeed or fail. In this paper, we examine three case studies of partially protected coral reef fishery systems to evaluate benefits and risks of their use as a management tool. We use data from community-based management arrangements in three Pacific Island countries to demonstrate three vignettes of how partial protection can boost fisheries production, enhance the ease with which fishers catch their prey, and alter the composition of fisheries yields. These changes in fisheries productivity, catchability, and vulnerability under partial protection carry substantial benefits for fishers. However, they also carry significant risks for ecosystems and fisheries livelihoods unless adaptively managed so as to confer the short to medium term benefits in resource performance without risking longer term sustainability.",2022,,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,27,1,,WOS:000771143200001,10.5751/ES-13112-270126,,#19429,Smallhorn-West 2022,,
Practical Marine Spatial Management of Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas: Emerging Lessons From Evidence-Based Planning and Implementation in a Developing-World Context,"Harris, LR; Holness, SD; Finke, G; Amunyela, M; Braby, R; Coelho, N; Gee, K; Kirkman, SP; Kreiner, A; Mausolf, E; Majiedt, P; Maletzky, E; Nsingi, KK; Russo, V; Sink, KJ; Sorgenfrei, R","Identifying key sites of marine biodiversity value and implementing the required practical spatial management measures is critical for safeguarding marine biodiversity and maintaining essential ecological processes, especially in the face of accelerating global change and expanding ocean economies. Delineating Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs) has been catalytic in progressing toward this aim. However, the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem (BCLME; comprising three developing countries: Angola, Namibia, and South Africa) is one of few places where practical action to secure biodiversity in EBSAs has followed their description. We aim to document the process of moving from biodiversity priority areas to implemented conservation actions, and distil broadly applicable emerging lessons. EBSAs in the BCLME were reviewed using a systematic conservation planning approach, supplemented with expert input. In this data- and knowledge-driven process, the boundaries and descriptions of existing EBSAs were refined, and gaps filled with new EBSAs. The status of 29 EBSAs was assessed by determining the ecological condition, ecosystem threat status, and ecosystem protection level of constituent ecosystem types. Also, current human uses and their respective impacts were systematically reviewed per EBSA. Management recommendations were proposed by dividing EBSAs into zones with associated multi-sector sea-use guidelines. Throughout the process, facilitated by a regional cooperation project, there was stakeholder engagement, and national, regional, and international review. BCLME States are currently implementing enhanced EBSA management in their respective marine spatial planning and marine protected area processes, noting that there are different but valid outcomes for securing marine biodiversity in each country. Further, the regional approach allowed for cross-border alignment of priorities and management between countries, as well as pooled expertise, technical support, and capacity development.

Equity in environmental governance: perceived fairness of distributional justice principles in marine co-management,"Gurney, GG; Mangubhai, S; Fox, M; Kim, MK; Agrawal, A","Concerns with distributional justice invariably arise in environmental governance, especially in the conservation and management of common-pool resources. These initiatives generate an array of costs and benefits that are typically heterogeneously distributed. Distribution of these impacts in a way that is considered fair by local stakeholders is not only a moral imperative, but instrumental to achieving social and ecological success given perceived unfairness fosters conflict and undermines cooperation. However, understandings of local stakeholders' conceptions of distributional fairness are rare because research often assesses distributional outcomes based on tacit assumptions about what constitutes fairness (e.g. equality). We examine what local stakeholders consider distributional fairness with respect to monetary benefits arising from a collective payment for ecosystem services scheme in a co-managed marine protected area in Fiji. In six villages associated with the co-managed marine protected area, we elicited individuals' fairness judgements of five distributional justice principles: equality, need, and three forms of proportionality based on customary rights, fisheries opportunity-costs, and involvement in co-management. We examine how fairness judgements are associated with socio-demographic characteristics indicative of key identities, thereby building on socially-aggregated approaches typical of the nascent literature on perceived fairness. We find the rights-based principle was considered the 'most fair' and the opportunity-costs principle the 'least fair'. Our findings challenge prevailing understandings of distributional justice in conservation and commons management, which favour the principles of equality or opportunity-cost. We also find that education was significantly positively related to fairness judgements of all principles, whilst wealth was significantly related to the equality and the opportunity-based principles. These results provide insights into how fairness judgements could be influenced by key elements of current social change in the Global South (e.g. increasing formal education, market engagement and wealth accumulation). Overall, our results suggest that fair environmental governance requires explicit identification of distributional fairness conceptions of those most affected by such initiatives, especially in a context of increasing globalisation of conservation knowledge and practice.",2021,,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY,124,,23-32,WOS:000691785800003,10.1016/j.envsci.2021.05.022,,#19431,Gurney 2021,,

Users of marine resources-commercial and recreational fishermen, boaters, divers, and others-experience direct and indirect costs and benefits from such measures, notably foregone earnings and changing economic opportunities. In this paper, we present results and tools from a 2-year project to build an integrated, spatially explicit analytical framework for assessing management options such as fleet reductions and area closures on the West Coast of the United States, using the groundfish fleet as an example. After developing an extensive relational database comprising fishery-dependent, ecological, and socioeconomic data, we built a regional geographic information system (GIS) and assessed the relative impacts of five management scenarios. The results are spatially explicit and specific to particular communities, gear groups, fishing fleets, and ecological habitats, thus allowing decision makers to consider a range of issues that present themselves in management situations.

Evaluating approaches for scaling-up community-based marine-protected areas into socially equitable and ecologically representative networks,"Kockel, A; Ban, NC; Costa, M; Dearden, P","Marine-protected areas (MPAs) are vital to marine conservation, but their coverage and distribution is insufficient to address declines in global biodiversity and fisheries. In response, many countries have committed through the Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity to conserve 10% of the marine environment through ecologically representative and equitably managed MPAs by 2020. The rush to fulfill this commitment has raised concerns on how increasing MPA coverage will affect other elements of Target 11, including representation and equity. We examined a Philippines case study to assess and compare 3 MPA planning approaches for biodiversity representation and equitable distribution of costs to small-scale fishers. In the opportunistic approach, MPAs were identified and supported by coastal communities. The donor-assisted approach used local knowledge to select MPAs through a national-scale and donor-assisted conservation project. The systematic conservation planning approach identified MPA locations with the spatial prioritization software Marxan with Zones to achieve biodiversity objectives with minimal costs to fishers. We collected spatial data on biodiversity and fisheries features and performed a gap analysis to evaluate MPAs derived from different approaches. We assessed representation based on the proportion of biodiversity features conserved in MPAs and distribution equity by the distribution of opportunity costs (fishing areas lost in MPAs) among fisher stakeholder groups. The opportunistic approach did not ineffectively represent biodiversity and resulted in inequitable costs to fishers. The donor-assisted approach affected fishers disproportionately but provided near-optimal regional representation. Only the systematic approach achieved all representation targets with minimal and equitable costs to fishers. Our results demonstrate the utility of systematic conservation planning to address key elements of Target 11 and highlight opportunities (e.g., integration of local and scientific knowledge can address representation and equity concerns) and pitfalls (e.g., insufficient stakeholder considerations can exacerbate social inequalities) for planning MPAs in similar contexts.",2020,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,34,1,137-147,WOS:000488594800001,10.1111/cobi.13368,,#19433,Kockel 2020,,
Forecasting the benefits of no-take human-made reefs using spatial ecosystem simulation,"Pitcher, TJ; Buchary, EA; Hutton, T","To forecast resource and fishery responses to artificial reefs deployed within no-take marine protected areas, we discuss an application of ECOSPACE, a policy evaluation tool based on spatially explicit simulation of ecosystem dynamics. We analyse a recent initiative to establish human-made reefs inside Marine Special Areas in Hong Kong. Simulations commence with a static mass-balanced model of trophic flows among he functional groups of an ecosystem (ECOPATH), which is then used to structure dynamic simulations of the biomass fluxes in response to fishing (ECOSIM). Spatial modelling is achieved through definition of dispersion, foraging, and predator avoidance parameters for each group in relation to a range of defined habitats (ECOSPACE). The ecosystem model comprised 27 functional groups and 7 sectors of the Hong Kong fishery, which were assumed to increase their catching power by 3% year(-1). Seven fishery sectors and gear types are defined, and their operations are simulated spatially to maximize operating profit within the areas where they are allowed to fish. Parameters for ECOPATH, ECOSIM, fishery, and habitats were obtained from recent surveys and assessments. Additional parameter values were obtained from meta-analyses and other literature on fishes of the South China Sea. More than 250 fish species were assigned to reef-associated and non-reef-associated functional groups with the help of an expert consultation. Results express average spatial responses to fishing and protected reefs. First, ECOSPACE was used to evaluate biomass responses and catch returns from a range of artificial reefs/marine protected area complexes in which size, perimeter, and corridor design were varied according to biogeographical theory. Benefits that might be deliberately forgone to obtain the cooperation of fishers by allowing them to fish designated reefs were also estimated. Secondly, five specific policy scenarios were evaluated using a spatial map of Hong Kong waters. Gains and losses to different fishery sectors were tracked, along with shifts in the species composition of the catches. While small protected areas with human-made reefs achieve little to avert collapse of the fisheries or a shift towards catches of low-value species, larger protected areas can do much to restore valuable fisheries for reef-associated fish. Precise results, but not the overall patterns, are sensitive to uncertainties in many model parameters. (C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

"Fishers' perceptions, facilitating factors and challenges of community-based no-take zones in the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve, Quintana Roo, Mexico","Velez, M; Adlerstein, S; Wondolleck, J","In response to fisheries decline in the Mexican Caribbean and continuing deterioration of the Mesoamerican Reef, conservation NGOs have begun to negotiate and collaboratively design a network of no-take zones (NTZs) with three fishing cooperatives in the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve (SKBR), among other places along the coast of Quintana Roo. Spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) is the target of the main fishery within cooperative concessions. Fishers are uniquely positioned to enforce and monitor NTZs and evaluate their effectiveness. This study analyzes fishers' perceptions as indicators of social acceptance of NTZs, and identifies facilitating factors and challenges of the community-based process. Consistent with similar studies, responses of fishers (89 out of a population of 124) to a semi-structured interview showed that perceptions of NTZs largely reflect fishers' concerns and interests. A high proportion of fishers accurately identified main NTZ objectives of regulation, conservation and economic improvement, as well as NTZ locations. Further, fishers cared about ecosystem sustainability and, because NTZs would not significantly limit their main economic activity, endorsed the initiative while expecting additional benefits. Declining trends in lobster catch influenced a perceived need for NTZs. Major concerns were that illegal fishers would reap NTZ benefits and that economic impacts and benefits were uncertain. Most fishers found the decision-making process inclusive, were willing to take responsibility for enforcing NTZs and believed people leading the process were trustworthy. Differences in endorsement of NTZs among cooperatives points to the importance of understanding fishers' incentives to collaborate, and the leadership and organizational dynamics which shape participatory processes. This analysis highlights challenges in advancing NTZs in complex ecological, socio-economic and regulatory contexts. It underscores the need for community-based processes that transcend understanding of conservation measures but also invests in sustainable, operative and trustful working relationships, as well as the urgency of interdisciplinary approaches in ensuring effective design and implementation of this relatively new fishery management tool.

Critical Systems Thinking for the Facilitation of Conservation Planning in Philippine Coastal Management,"Larsen, RK","In Critical Systems Thinking, the notion of boundary judgements represents a constructionist view on knowing as the bounding of components of reality into knowable objects. Cognitive boundary judgements determine observations (facts) and evaluations (values), which knowers appreciate and act in relation to. Werner Ulrich's method of dialogical boundary critique and the framework of Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH) are intended to enable citizen participation in Western democracies through acknowledgement of legitimate competencies in public and corporate dialogues. This paper investigates the application of this methodology in Philippine coastal resource management. The conclusions are based on stakeholder-based action planning carried out between November 2007 and May 2008 in the Babuyan group of islands, bounded by the Balintang and Babuyan Channels. It argues that dialogical boundary critique requires significant adaptation if it is to provide a liberating language for participants in Philippine resource management dilemmas shaped by multiple and conflicting knowledge claims under conditions of significant controversy.

The socio-economic effects of a Marine Protected Area on the ecosystem service of leisure and recreation,"Rees, SE; Mangi, SC; Hattam, C; Gall, SC; Rodwell, LD; Peckett, FJ; Attrill, MJ","Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are an important tool for the maintenance of marine ecosystem functionality and health and ensuring the onward flow of beneficial ecosystem services that support human well-being. Social and economic factors influence whether and how stakeholders exploit resources or cooperate to conserve them. Environmental managers are now turning from designating MPAs to monitoring their effectiveness. Combining spatial analysis with quantitative and qualitative survey methods this research shows that an MPA (Lyme Bay, SW England) has had varying effects on the delivery of the beneficial ecosystem service of leisure and recreation. In the survey years 2008-2011 dive businesses have increased their frequency of activity inside and outside the MPA and report an increase in turnover; though they perceive little or no effect of the MPA on business. Charter boat operators have seen an overall decline in the frequency of activity outside the MPA and an increase inside the MPA. They perceive that the MPA has increasingly had a positive effect on their business. Sea angling activity has declined at sites outside the MPA and increased at sites within the MPA, suggesting a redistribution of spatial activity. Diving activity has increased both inside and outside the MPA. Divers report that the MPA has influenced where they choose to dive. This corresponds to a potential increase in value of the MPA resource (represented as the proportional expenditure and associated turnover by these groups) of 2.2 million. This research demonstrates that the use of the resource has changed following designation and that MPAs can attract a greater proportion of the leisure and recreation expenditure and associated turnover to sites within the MPA boundary. Moving forward it is important to assess effects both inside and outside MPAs. Integrating high quality social science at MPA sites to track effectiveness can help to adapt and refine management strategies to reflect the needs of the stakeholders and support effective conservation.

Whilst near-shore aggregation hotspots in the UK have been identified, robust knowledge on species distribution and abundance outside these areas remains limited. Research techniques, such as habitat modelling, could however be used to gain a greater knowledge of the species distribution to inform management plans to aid population recovery. For large mobile species gathering wide-scale distribution data can be financially and logistically challenging. In lieu of conducting an expensive UK-wide strategic survey for basking sharks, we use data from two regional-scale surveys, which were conducted in southwest England and western Scotland, in an Ensemble Ecological Niche Model (EENM) to produce a spatially-explicit map of habitat suitability. When compared against a similar to 20-year database of public sightings of basking sharks across UK coastal seas (to 6 nautical miles offshore), patterns of habitat suitability yielded a statistically significant agreement with areas known to support basking shark sightings. EENMs could be used to advise Marine Protected Area (MPA) selection, as well as to inform environmental impact assessments for offshore developments. The application of EENM outputs could be wide-reaching and benefit not only basking sharks but other large mobile marine species in the north-east Atlantic.",2019,,JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH,153,,,WOS:000489353200001,10.1016/j.seares.2019.101767,,#19443,Austin 2019,,
Seeing the ocean through the eyes of seabirds: A new path for marine conservation?,"Lescroel, A; Mathevet, R; Peron, C; Authier, M; Provost, P; Takahashi, A; Gremillet, D","Seeing the ocean through the eyes of seabirds could help meet the challenges of managing common-pool marine resources both in protected and unprotected areas. First, seabirds are top-predators, exposed to all threats affecting the oceans, and this makes them ideal sentinel organisms for monitoring changes within marine ecosystems. Second, seabirds cross both ecological and political boundaries, and following their movements should help making interdependencies within and between marine ecosystems more visible. Third, seabirds are conspicuous and often charismatic animals, which interact differently with different groups of stakeholders and provide the opportunity to acknowledge and discuss each other's values and interests. In this paper, we present these research avenues using a seabirds' view, for tackling marine conservation and management issues, and we give operational examples of implementation based on our work in the English Channel.

International cooperation and coordination in the Global Legislation of High Seas ABMTs including MPAs: Taking OSPAR practice as reference,"Tang, Y; Chen, WJ; Zhang, YXD","In the negotiation of the new Agreement on the conservation and sustainable use of marine Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ), how to resolve potential overlaps, inconsistencies and conflicts between the new Agreement and relevant global, sectoral and regional instruments, framework and bodies (IFBs) on the issues about Area-Based Management Tools (ABMTs) including Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in ABNJ, is a key matter on the table. To explore how establishing high seas ABMTs including MPAs via the BBNJ might work in practice, this paper selects the practice of OSPAR and NEAFC as an example of regional cooperation. It finds that in the absence of top-down authority, this regional cooperation cannot fill the functional and geographical gaps, or harmonize different instruments relating to establishing and managing the High Seas ABMTs including MPAs. It then examines the challenges under a centralized global structure proposed in BBNJ negotiation, and proposes a practical global structure for cooperation and coordination. It suggests that a global decision-making body and their subordinates under the BBNJ may be empowered with different authorities under different scenarios. They may act as ""cooperation initiator"" and ""conflict coordinator"" of the ABMTs including MPAs where there is relevant IFBs, achieving objectives by coordinating with existing mechanisms; or act as ""gap filler"" by directly establishing and managing ABMTs including MPAs where there is no IFBs. This decision-making body should be empowered to develop general objectives and indicative criteria for the identification of areas, establish or designate ABMTs including MPAs, and strengthen monitoring and review.",2021,,MARINE POLICY,133,,,WOS:000700583200013,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104767,,#19447,Tang 2021,,
Ostrom's Governance Principles and Sustainable Financing of Fish Reserves,"Wiederkehr, C; Berghofer, A; Otsuki, K","Previous studies on community-based natural resource management have repeatedly underlined the significance of the design principles for sustainable commons governance developed by Elinor Ostrom. In this paper, we apply the principles heuristically to the case of the Sikunga Channel Fish Protection Area (FPA), a recently established fish reserve in the Upper Zambezi in Namibia. Based on qualitative fieldwork including semi-structured household interviews, expert interviews, focus group discussions and participant observation, we assess the utility of Ostrom's design principles as guidance for promoting sustainable fisheries co-management structures. Our results indicate that the lack of a sustainable financing mechanism is both a major source of resentments at Sikunga and the main obstacle for sound resource management, endangering the long-term effectiveness and social acceptance of the fish reserve.",2019,,HUMAN ECOLOGY,47,1,13-25,WOS:000460693800002,10.1007/s10745-019-0052-0,,#19449,Wiederkehr 2019,,

"Indicator-based management recommendations for an artisanal bottom-longline fishery in Costa Rica, Central America","Bystrom, AB; Naranjo-Madrigal, H; Wehrtmann, IS","There is a growing need to strengthen the small-scale fishing sector with emerging governance methods that improve fishers' threatened livelihoods. Therefore, this study's aim was to develop management recommendations, based on easily interpreted conclusions that can be used to address the socio-ecological difficulties that the artisanal, bottom-longline fishery in Bejuco, Pacific coast of Costa Rica faces. The results of previously recorded fisher socio-ecological perceptions and an evaluation of the spotted rose snapper's, Lutjanus guttatus, population dynamics were assigned a measurable set of indicators in reference to the fishery's natural, human and management sub-systems. This was done via the traffic light method with easily interpreted colors based on a review of similar published fisheries studies. According to these results, a stock assessment for the fishery's target species and research to determine the composition and magnitude of the fishery's discarded species were recommended. Fisher economic dependence on bottom-longline activities led to the recommendation to develop alternative livelihood strategies. Also, the promotion of alternative markets and sustainability certification strategies for the snapper fishery are advised. Enlargement of the multi-use marine protected areas within the fishery's grounds and improvement of their management strategies is also recommended. In order for this to occur, improved resource user coordination in the form of a fisher association that has the capability to lobby for increased enforcement of the protected areas from destructive fisheries must be realized. Doing so would aid the development of a local management plan and participatory governance system. Such an initiative would justify the development of community lead marine protected area management regimes.",2017,,REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,65,2,475-492,WOS:000404822900004,,,#19452,Bystrom 2017,,

This paper evaluates the feasibility of a new CBME product (marine underwater trail) in a protected area in northeastern Brazil, through a seven phase process. The Environmental Protection Area of Tinhare and Boipeba presented excellent conditionS for implantation of the product; Tassimirim beach was selected as the location due to its diverse marine reefs geobiodiversity, allowing the creation of a 320 m long trail; 89% of the participants who tested the product evaluated it as ""excellent""; 76% of participants would accept to pay US$ 17.00 to US$ 33.00 for the product; more than 79% of the local residents and entrepreneurs found the initiative excellent. The product was applied for 10 days and generated US$ 433.00. We concluded that the CBME product showed efficacy and economic/environmental sustainability.

"Benefits and Challenges of Scaling Up Expansion of Marine Protected Area Networks in the Verde Island Passage, Central Philippines","Horigue, V; Pressey, RL; Mills, M; Brotankova, J; Cabral, R; Andrefouet, S","Locally-established marine protected areas (MPAs) have been proven to achieve local-scale fisheries and conservation objectives. However, since many of these MPAs were not designed to form ecologically-connected networks, their contributions to broader-scale goals such as complementarity and connectivity can be limited. In contrast, integrated networks of MPAs designed with systematic conservation planning are assumed to be more effective-ecologically, socially, and economically-than collections of locally-established MPAs. There is, however, little empirical evidence that clearly demonstrates the supposed advantages of systematic MPA networks. A key reason is the poor record of implementation of systematic plans attributable to lack of local buy-in. An intermediate scenario for the expansion of MPAs is scaling up of local decisions, whereby locally-driven MPA initiatives are coordinated through collaborative partnerships among local governments and their communities. Coordination has the potential to extend the benefits of individual MPAs and perhaps to approach the potential benefits offered by systematic MPA networks. We evaluated the benefits of scaling up local MPAs to form networks by simulating seven expansion scenarios for MPAs in the Verde Island Passage, central Philippines. The scenarios were: uncoordinated community-based establishment of MPAs; two scenarios reflecting different levels of coordinated MPA expansion through collaborative partnerships; and four scenarios guided by systematic conservation planning with different contexts for governance. For each scenario, we measured benefits through time in terms of achievement of objectives for representation of marine habitats. We found that: in any governance context, systematic networks were more efficient than non-systematic ones; systematic networks were more efficient in broader governance contexts; and, contrary to expectations but with caveats, the uncoordinated scenario was slightly more efficient than the coordinated scenarios. Overall, however, coordinated MPA networks have the potential to be more efficient than the uncoordinated ones, especially when coordinated planning uses systematic methods.",2015,,PLOS ONE,10,8,,WOS:000360018600069,10.1371/journal.pone.0135789,,#19456,Horigue 2015,,
It's All About Your Network: Using ROVs to Assess Marine Protected Area Effectiveness,"IEEE; Rosen, D; Lauermann, A","California implemented the State's first network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) within the nearshore waters of the northern Channel Islands in 2003. These protections serve as a tool to help ensure the long-term sustainability of marine populations and act as a living laboratory to better understand outside impacts on marine life. California's network operates synergistically to meet the objectives that a single reserve might not. In 2006 and 2007, NOAA expanded this network of thirteen MPAs into the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary's deeper waters, at the time, making them the largest integrated system of MPAs of the continental United States. Historically, marine habitats around the Channel Islands were well surveyed by scuba divers to a depth of 20 meters, but the deeper waters remained poorly studied. Together, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Marine Applied Research and Exploration (MARE) developed a long-term Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) program to monitor the changes these MPAs show over time. ROV configuration, survey design and protocols, as well as data post processing and analysis techniques, were developed to specifically evaluate how marine populations respond to the establishment of a network of MPAs.To capture the ecological condition of Channel Islands MPAs at the time of implementation, the ROVs were configured to capture both fish and invertebrate data concurrently. Each ROV was equipped with both forward and downward facing video cameras, which provided a continuous view in front of and below the ROV. Ranging sonars aligned with both video cameras were used to calculate video transect width and an ultra-long baseline tracking system was used to calculate transect length and geo-reference the imagery. This allowed us to calculate species densities and relative abundance. Oceanographic parameters were collected by Sea-Bird conductivity, temperature, depth and dissolved oxygen sensors. Stereo video cameras were recently added for accurate sizing of fish and invertebrates.ROV survey sites were initially identified with acoustic bottom maps and then confirmed with exploratory ROV dive surveys. A total of eighteen potential sites were evaluated, with ten being selected for continued monitoring (five site pairs). Inside-outside site pairs were selected for long-term survey based upon similarity in the types and amounts of rocky substrate present, proximity to one another, and depth. The same ten sites were surveyed annually from 2005-2009, providing a solid baseline for assessing changes in marine populations. Analysis of this data showed little if any change in densities of rockfish species targeted by the commercial and recreational fisheries. In 2014 and 2015, MARE returned to re-survey the same ten historical sites. Preliminary analysis of the 2014 and 2015 data indicates that many of these rockfish species have shown a dramatic increase when compared to baseline densities inside and outside the reserves.California has now expanded upon this network, bringing its total to 124 MPAs, comprising 16% of states waters along its 1,100 mile coastline. This makes California's network one of the world's largest established MPA networks-but not without controversy. Fishermen, stakeholders and marine managers vary in how they embrace network benefits to marine populations and the economic communities that depend on them. Over 65% of California's MPA protection falls within water depths exceeding 20 meters. Understanding how these deepsea ecosystems respond to a network approach of protection is critical in evaluating not only the effectiveness of California's MPAs, but also for understanding the spatial and temporal scale at which these networks respond. The positive change in rockfish abundance currently observed at the Northern Channel Islands provides the first opportunity to test the effect networked MPAs have on local populations, and how these areas work cooperatively to rebuild and protect critical marine populations.",2016,,OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE MONTEREY,,,,WOS:000399929000064,10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761055,,#19457,IEEE 2016,,
"Critical analysis of the governance of the Sainte Luce Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA), southeast Madagascar","Long, S; Thurlow, G; Jones, PJS; Turner, A; Randrianantenaina, SM; Gammage, T; Savage, J; Ndriamanja, JR","The Marine Protected Area Governance (MPAG) framework is applied to critically assess the governance of the Sainte Luce Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA), southeast Madagascar. Madagascar experiences rapid population growth, widespread poverty, corruption and political instability, which hinders natural resource governance. Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) has been repeatedly employed to circumvent the lack of state capacity. This includes the LMMA model, which has rapidly proliferated, represented by MIHARI, Madagascar's LMMA network. The lobster fishing is the primary source of income for households in the impoverished community of Sainte Luce, one of the key landing sites in the regional export industry. However, fishers, industry actors and available data suggest a significant decline of local and regional stocks, likely due to over-exploitation driven by poverty and migration. In 2013, SEED Madagascar a UK NGO, worked to establish community-based fishery management in Sainte Luce, setting up a local management committee, which introduced a periodic no take zone (NTZ). Despite the community's efforts and some significant achievements, the efficacy of management is limited. To date, limited state support and the lack of engagement by actors throughout the value chain have hampered effective governance. The study reinforces the finding that resilient governance relies on a diversity of actors and the incentives they collectively employ. Here and elsewhere, there is a limit to what can be achieved by bottom-up approaches in isolation. Resilient management of marine resources in Madagascar relies on improving the capacity of community, state, NGO and industry actors to collectively govern resources.",2021,,MARINE POLICY,127,,,WOS:000663338400006,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103691,,#19458,Long 2021,,
Developing community-derived indicators of economic status in the coral triangle: A management support tool,"Cullen-Unsworth, LC; Pretty, J; Smith, DJ","Environmental management initiatives commonly fail because of a lack of compliance from local communities, due largely to actual or perceived economic losses. Management should therefore aim to maintain or improve the economic status of local people. Development of economic performance criteria (EPC), as testable parameters through which changes in economic status can be identified, provide a mechanism for assessment of the economic impacts of management. Community perspectives of wealth, and potential applications for the design of locally relevant community-derived EPC were explored in a biodioverse and multicultural region within the coral triangle. A methodology is demonstrated for the development of locally relevant and locally comprehensible indicators. Household interviews and participatory wealth ranking exercises were conducted from which extensive socioeconomic data was generated to identify and test a series of potential EPC. An Economic Score (ES) was calculated and provided a simple mechanism for 'at a glance' spatial and temporal comparisons. Household income was used to verify EPC and ES. The participatory identification of EPC represents a novel tool with potential for application in the development of environmental management initiatives that aim to maintain ecological wealth and support sustainable resource utilisation, whilst maintaining or improving local economic status, and hence compliance.

Getting to the bottom of it: Bringing social science into benthic habitat management,"McCay, BJ","Social science has a small but growing place within marine science and policy. Legal and political imperatives for social impact assessment have increased attention to the need for social research, and the high frequency of conflict over and resistance to habitat and fisheries management measures, including marine protected areas, suggests that there is much to be done. The methodology of social impact assessment is changing to incorporate notions such as vulnerability and tools such as mapping. In the larger sense, social science helps identify and formulate ""sea changes"" in the knowledge base and institutional framework for marine science and conservation. These are major developments in the understanding of the human dimensions of fisheries and marine environments that have begun to influence both research and policy. The ""sea changes"" identified are increased attention to more cooperative, participatory, and community-oriented research and management regimes on the one hand and increased reliance on exclusive property rights and markets on the other.",2005,,BENTHIC HABITATS AND THE EFFECTS OF FISHING,41,,713-725,WOS:000232152900052,,,#19460,McCay 2005,,
Importance of attitudinal differences among artisanal fishers toward co-management and conservation of marine resources,"Gelcich, S; Edwards-Jones, G; Kaiser, MJ","The Chilean government has introduced a policy that gives formal property rights over defined areas of seabed to organized groups of artisanal fishers with the goal of achieving sustainable exploitation of natural resources. We assessed differences in the attitudes of participating artisanal fishers toward this form of management to understand their importance in the design and implementation of fisheries management. We used questionnaires and participatory rural appraisal techniques to survey members of six fishing management committees. Fishers' attitudes varied significantly among syndicates in three main domains: attitudes toward the environment, unresolved aspects behind the management area policy and perceived benefits derived from adoption of the policy. These differences indicated the existence of distinct world views that structure fishers' behavior toward the marine environment and its management. In addition, the responses made by fishers correlated best with the degree of off-sector pluriactivity and their dependence on diving as a source of income. This suggested that a livelihood approach to the development of Chilean artisanal fisheries that considers the multiple economic niches of the fishers will be most effective in the implementation of dual conservation/management measures.",2005,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,19,3,865-875,WOS:000229448100038,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00534.x,,#19461,Gelcich 2005,,
Ecological and socioeconomic impacts of marine protected areas in the South Pacific: assessing the evidence base,"Smallhorn-West, PF; Weeks, R; Gurney, G; Pressey, RL","Marine protected areas (MPAs) in the South Pacific have a unique history that calls for a regional-scale synthesis of MPA impacts and the factors related to positive ecological and socioeconomic change. However, recommendations of best approaches to MPA implementation can be made only when evaluation techniques are sound. Impact evaluation involves quantifying the effects of an intervention over and above the counterfactual of no intervention or a different intervention. Determining the true impact of an MPA can be challenging because additional factors beyond the presence of an MPA can confound the observed results (e.g. differences in ecological or socioeconomic conditions between MPA and control sites). While impact evaluation techniques employing counterfactual thinking have been well developed in other fields, they have been embraced only slowly in the MPA evaluation literature. We conducted a structured literature search and synthesis of MPA evaluation studies from the South Pacific to determine: (i) the overall ecological and socioeconomic impacts of MPAs in the region, (ii) what factors were associated with positive, neutral, or negative impacts, and (iii) to what extent the MPA evaluation literature from the region has incorporated counterfactual thinking and robust impact evaluation techniques. Based on 52 identified studies, 42% of measured ecological impacts were positive. While 72% of socioeconomic impacts were positive, these were from only eight studies. The proportion of positive impacts was comparable between community-based and centrally governed MPAs, suggesting that both governance approaches are viable options in the region. No-take MPAs had a greater number of positive ecological impacts than periodic closures and there was little evidence of any long-term ecological recovery within periodic closures following harvesting. Importantly, more than half of the studies examined (59%) did not provide any clear consideration of factors beyond the presence of the MPA that might have confounded their results. We conclude that counterfactual thinking has yet to be fully embraced in impact evaluation studies in the region and recommend pathways by which progress can be made.",2020,,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,29,2,349-380,WOS:000522817100001,10.1007/s10531-019-01918-1,,#19463,Smallhorn-West 2020,,

This article examines the development and trajectory of King and Snow Crab fisheries in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve (BR), the highly remote but globally connected Southern tip of the Americas. The feasibility of the Chilean legal instrument of Marine Management Areas (MMA) is assessed as a tool for mitigating impacts of overfishing in the area. Examining the local fishers' perspectives in complement to a context analysis we find that external management models such as the MMA are not suited to make Cape Horn fisheries sustainable. Instead, efforts should be dedicated to a continuous process of stakeholder collaboration for developing site-specific management concepts and structures. These should be embedded in the larger BR initiative. Considering the area's particular conditions, several recommendations for such a process are formulated. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

How do marine and coastal citizen science experiences foster environmental engagement?,"Dean, AJ; Church, EK; Loder, J; Fielding, KS; Wilson, KA","Citizen science programs enable community involvement in scientific research. In addition to fostering greater science literacy, some citizen science programs aim to foster engagement in environmental issues. However, few data are available to indicate whether and how citizen science programs can achieve greater environmental engagement. We survey individuals choosing to attend one of seventeen reef citizen science events and examine the extent to which attendees reported three indicators of greater environmental engagement: (i) willingness to share information, (ii) increased support for marine conservation and citizen science, and (iii) intentions to adopt a new behavior. Most participants reported being willing to share information about reef conservation (91%) and described increased support for marine science and conservation (87%). Half of participants (SA) reported intentions to adopt a new conservation behavior. We found that key elements of the citizen science experience associated with these outcomes were learning about actions to protect reefs and coasts (procedural learning), experiencing surprise, and experiencing negative emotions about environmental problems. Excitement was also associated with positive outcomes, but only in participants who were less likely to see themselves as environmental, or were less frequent visitors to reefs and coasts. Importantly, the association between factual learning and environmental engagement outcomes was limited or negative. These findings suggest that the way citizen science experiences make people feel, may be more important for fostering future environmental engagement than factual-based learning. When designing citizen science programs for community members, these findings provide a reminder to not focus on provision of factual information alone, but to highlight environmental impacts while providing meaningful experiences and building environmental skills.

As pre-processing, the map projections of all scenes were transformed to the geographical latitude and longitude coordinate system and also the land areas, deep sea areas, and cloudy areas were masked to prevent degradation of classification accuracy. The shallow sea areas where coral reefs are expected were clustered to 10 classes by the ISODATA algorithm and aggregated to the six categories: coral cover 5 to 50%, coral cover 50 to 100%, seaweed/seagrass, sand bottom, mud bottom, and rock. After verification, the maps were transformed from raster to vector data format for easy handling on GIS software.",2010,,NETWORKING THE WORLD WITH REMOTE SENSING,38,,534-537,WOS:000341930000116,,,#19474,Kakuta 2010,,
"Evaluating the Australian Defence Force stakeholder participation at Shoalwater Bay Training Area, Queensland, Australia","Wu, W; Wang, XH; Paull, D","Stakeholder participation has become a popular management approach and its significance has been widely recognised. There is a lack of studies regarding evaluation of stakeholder participation, especially in environmental management by defence sectors. This paper examines how the Australian Defence Force (ADF) involves stakeholders in environmental management and its effectiveness, using Shoalwater Bay Training Area, Queensland, as a case study. Based on the combination of field observations, extensive interviews, a public questionnaire survey and relevant analyses, this study concluded that, overall, stakeholder participation was considered by respondents to be marginally effective.

"Qualitative assessment of stakeholders and visitors perceptions towards coastal tourism development at Teluk kemang, port dickson, Malaysia","Hanafiah, MH; Jamaluddin, MR; Kunjuraman, V","Malaysia is one of the countries with the highest growing number of tourists in coastal areas. While coastal tourism has the potential to provide economic and employment opportunities in destination countries, there are concerns about the negative impacts of such activities. This paper aims to: (i) draw from stakeholders and visitors perceptions to understand their view on the Teluk Kemang marine environment and; (ii) explores the stakeholders and visitors attitudes and expectations toward the tourism activities and; (iii) how such activity affects the economic, social and environmental aspects of Teluk Kemang. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted among the Teluk Kemang visitors and stakeholders (domestic and international tourist, local resident, government official, and business operator). Tourism development impact factors identified included: economic, environmental, governance and infrastructure. This study found a strong sentiment of community participation and a sense of community facilitating and minimising the negative impact of tourism development and activities. Continuous efforts from tourism planners, developers, and policymakers are needed to develop strategies that can mitigate the adverse effects of coastal tourism activities. In addition, this study proposes that improving local governance and engaging the local community will be the key to maintaining the sustainability of Teluk Kemang coastal resources and the local economy.",2021,,JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,35,,,WOS:000760322800014,10.1016/j.jort.2021.100389,,#19476,Hanafiah 2021,,
Use of Long-Distance Migration Patterns of an Endangered Species to Inform Conservation Planning for the World's Largest Marine Protected Area,"Hays, GC; Mortimer, JA; Ierodiaconou, D; Esteban, N","Large marine protected areas (MPAs), each hundreds of thousands of square kilometers, have been set up by governments around the world over the last decade as part of efforts to reduce ocean biodiversity declines, yet their efficacy is hotly debated. The Chagos Archipelago MPA (640,000 km(2)) (Indian Ocean) lies at the heart of this debate. We conducted the first satellite tracking of a migratory species, the green turtle (Chelonia mydas), within the MPA and assessed the species' use of protected versus unprotected areas. We developed an approach to estimate length of residence within the MPA that may have utility across migratory taxa including tuna and sharks. We recorded the longest ever published migration for an adult cheloniid turtle (3979 km). Seven of 8 tracked individuals migrated to distant foraging grounds, often 1000 km outside the MPA. One turtle traveled to foraging grounds within the MPA. Thus, networks of small MPAs, developed synergistically with larger MPAs, may increase the amount of time migrating species spend within protected areas. The MPA will protect turtles during the breeding season and will protect some turtles on their foraging grounds within the MPA and others during the first part of their long-distance postbreeding oceanic migrations. International cooperation will be needed to develop the network of small MPAs needed to supplement the Chagos Archipelago MPA.

Environmental stewardship as a new form of fisheries governance,"Gray, TS; Hatchard, J","Environmental stewardship is a form of governance that reflects the rising tide of influence on fisheries management exerted by environmental principles such as marine protected areas, the ecosystem-based approach, and the precautionary approach. First, we assess the extent to which environmental stewardship has moved beyond the level of rhetoric, whereby regulators pay lip service to such principles, and has reached such a level of power that environmental priorities hold sway over the decision-making process. In other words, we consider how far environmental stewardship has infiltrated the political system by constructing a powerful network of governance, including what is known in the international environmental politics literature as an ""epistemic community"". Second, we establish the foundational conception on which this environmental stewardship rests: is it nature conservation or is it sustainable development? Elements of both conceptions are found in most of the sources of the environmental stewardship mode of fisheries governance (though in differing proportions), but there is a threat to the fishing industry if the nature conservation conception becomes dominant. The best strategy for industry is to embrace the sustainable development conception of environmental stewardship and to demonstrate that the objectives of the nature conservation conception can and must be accommodated within the over-arching conception of sustainable development. Otherwise, industry could find itself increasingly marginalized in fisheries decision-making by a top-down imposition of nature conservationist environmental stewardship imperatives.",2007,,ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE,64,4,786-792,WOS:000247894900034,10.1093/icesjms/fsl041,,#19478,Gray 2007,,
The Co-governance of Fisheries in Post-conflict Sierra Leone: Is the Transition for Better or for Worse?,"Khan, A; Sei, S","In this contribution, we examine whether current governance mechanisms for sustaining the fisheries resources are better now than they were prior to the civil conflict of the 1990s in Sierra Leone, and if they are not, what policy instruments could contribute to improving governance. The establishment of co-managed systems during the post-conflict period as a conduit for introducing territorial user rights and marine protected areas constitutes an important step towards stewardship and stakeholder involvement in decision-making. However, the process has been criticized on the basis that it was rushed, thereby jeopardizing program implementation at the local level. Using the governability concept and fish chain as analytical tools, an assessment of the transition period from top down to co-management is undertaken to understand the overall quality of governance. There is evidence that the reforms are essential in promoting participatory governance and attaining multiple co-benefits in conservation and development. Yet, the institutional capacity at the local level is inadequate for effective compliance and monitoring. As a result, there is a need to strengthen the governing capacity and build linkages between fisheries and other economic planning activities where capacity is concentrated. Such efforts and transitional changes are relevant for achieving collective action especially in fragile states that are experiencing the increasing impacts of global environmental and economic changes.",2015,,INTERACTIVE GOVERNANCE FOR SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES: GLOBAL REFLECTIONS,13,,559-581,WOS:000384051700037,10.1007/978-3-319-17034-3_2910.1007/978-3-319-17034-3,,#19479,Khan 2015,,
Development of a Caribbean regional conservation strategy for reef fish spawning aggregations,"Luckhurst, BE","Intensive fishing of spawning aggregations (SPAGs) has led to the degradation of many sites on a global scale. Recent scientific studies have confirmed the decline or demise of many aggregations. The need to take action to ensure the protection of spawning aggregations led to the formation of the Society for the Conservation of ReefFish Aggregations (SCRFA). Many of the economically important reef fish species e.g. groupers and snappers, share life history characteristics which make these species particularly vulnerable to overexploitation. The formation of spawning aggregations by most of these species exacerbates this vulnerability. The documentation and evaluation of the status of spawning aggregations of groupers and snappers in the region indicates that most sites have been suffering declines in landings. In particular, the Nassau grouper has been significantly impacted by fishing pressure with the disappearance of a number of sites in different countries. A conservation strategy for spawning aggregations in the Caribbean region is presented comprising the following seven elements:i) Elimination of fishing mortality at vulnerable SPAG sites,ii) Incorporation of known SPAG sites into planning programs for Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to provide permanent protection of the sites,iii) Development and implementation of monitoring programs to evaluate the effect of management /conservation measures,iv) Development of community based management programs for SPAG sites,v) Provision of viable economic alternatives to those user groups who are displaced from SPAG sites, andvi) Application of gear restrictions to reduce catchability if closure of SPAG sites cannot be implemented,vi) Use ofeconomic/marketmeasures such as sales or export restrictions to reduce fishing activity at SPAGs.",2003,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTY-FOURTH ANNUAL GULF AND CARIBBEAN FISHERIES INSTITUTE,,,668-679,WOS:000182548000056,,,#19480,Luckhurst 2003,,

Increasing risks associated with environmental change along with highly degraded coastal ecosystems encompass complex management challenges for the long-term sustainability of these landscapes. This article aims to explore the role of protected areas in past and ongoing community adaptation to the compounded effects of climatic and anthropogenic change. A literature review of published articles is conducted through systematic queries of the bibliographic database Web of Sciences, and by comparing adaptation and social ecological resilience processes within and out of coastal protected areas. Findings underscore the absence of specific studies that target these topics inside protected areas, highlighting a geographic bias towards research largely carried out in developed countries. Results also indicate the current need for management practices within protected areas to adopt more participatory, comprehensive, and flexible approaches.

"Impacts of dispersal, ecological interactions, and fishing effort dynamics on efficacy of marine protected areas: How large should protected areas be?","Walters, C","Management for sustainable fisheries requires effective tactics for limiting exploitation rates. Limitation based on annual stock assessments and total allowable catches calculated from these assessments can be very dangerous, and marine protected areas (MPAs) are one means by which to limit exploitation rate directly even when total stock size is highly uncertain. This application of MPAs would probably require much larger areas than are now envisioned for limited objectives related to protection of seed spawning stock and local biodiversity. It might in fact cause a basic shift in thinking-from regarding MPAs as exceptional areas to regarding fishing areas as the exception las is now the practice in, e.g., salmon and herring fisheries). The present paper describes the use of ECOSPACE, a new modeling tool based on ecosystem simulations, for preliminary determination of how large MPAs need to be; ECOSPACE models suggest that dispersal, trophic responses (prey depletion, increased dispersal of predators in response to competition), and spatial fishing-effort responses (concentration of fishing near MPA boundaries) are all likely to reduce the effectiveness of small MPAs. The models suggest we should see not simple high-low density differences across MPA boundaries but rather spatial gradients from law density in exploited areas to high density near the centers of larger MPAs. Such spatial density gradients should be accompanied by spatially organized 'trophic cascade' patterns if trophic interactions are important determinants of abundance. MPA design can work with or against spatial variation in fishing effort caused by economic cost and risk factors; ECOSPACE can help to demonstrate ecological consequences of alternative design strategies, but the most important uncertainties are about socioeconomic responses (cooperation or competition) rather than ecological ones. Design of experimental policies and monitoring programs for evaluation of MPAs should proceed from careful modeling to define likely spatial, temporal, and trophic scales for both ecological and fishing responses.",2000,,BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE,66,3,745-757,WOS:000088894300017,,,#19484,Walters 2000,,
Blue Water Visitor Monitoring Potential: A Literature Review and Alternative Proposal,"Andrew, RG; Burns, RC; Schwarzmann, D; Allen, ME; Moreira, JC","This review presents a summary of existing visitor monitoring methods and relevant studies in land and marine-based areas, with a focus on the application to unique aquatic settings. Various opportunities and challenges exist with respect to the use of each method in different marine settings. These methods differ in terms of the complexity, costs, level of accuracy, and detailed information they provide. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying these methods also depends on the site attributes of a marine area. Since each marine area varies in geographical scale and environmental and social conditions, some methods will be more appropriate or perform more successfully than others in a particular location. Therefore, the consideration of these methods should be part of a proposed alternative process, focused on adaptive monitoring that scales to address visitor ebbs and flows in these aquatic areas. The proposed alternative seeks to develop consensus around quantitative goals for visitor monitoring and estimating techniques in marine settings, using a customizable mix of methods and techniques. This alternative effort progresses to subsequent tasks and discussions, and recommendations are made considering the feasibility and confidence of using these methods in particular marine settings and future pilot sites.",2021,,WATER,13,3,,WOS:000615628200001,10.3390/w13030305,,#19485,Andrew 2021,,REVIEW ARTICLE
Resource co-management as a step towards gender equity in fisheries,"Freitas, CT; Espirito-Santo, HMV; Campos-Silva, JV; Peres, CA; Lopes, PFM","Women greatly contribute to fisheries worldwide, representing 47% of the global fisheries' workforce. Yet female fishing roles often go unrecognized. In the Brazilian Amazonia, arapaima (Arapaima spp.) co-management, which began in the 2000s, may represent a significant change in this scenario. To assess the impact of arapaima co-management on women recognition in fisheries, we conducted a comprehensive assessment at 54 fishing communities, across similar to 1500-km of a major Amazonian river. Based on quantitative data from interviews with 143 women, we show that arapaima co-management represented an innovative source of female income from fisheries and an unprecedented recognition of women participation in fishing activities. In communities with arapaima co-management, median female fishing revenue was US$ 215/yr and mean probability of women earning income from fisheries was 77%, a marked difference from the virtually non-existent female fishing income at communities without arapaima co-management (median = US$ 0; mean probability = 8%). Although many women often participate in commercial fisheries, arapaima co-management has been the only source of fishing income for most of them. We discuss the potentials, limitations and broad implications of our case study, which can serve as a model to be adapted to other extractive economies worldwide seeking to enhance gender equity.",2020,,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,176,,,WOS:000556782100003,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106709,,#19486,Freitas 2020,,
Ecosystems services research in action: reflexively valuing environments in the South Pacific,"Hunter, CE; Lauer, M","Ecosystem services (ES) are heralded as an approach that communicates across disciplines and between researchers and resource managers, encouraging more environmentally sustainable human behavior. However, most studies presuppose that ""values"" are ontologically distinct from ""ecosystem services"" without examining what this framing enables and occludes about human and other-than-human relations. Through a reflexive research approach, we conduct a conventional photo elicitation ES survey among four groups in Moorea, French Polynesia, while also eliciting respondents' evaluations of the survey method, and documenting the method in action as participants interacted with it. Photo elicitation results suggest that fishers valued the subsistence fishery while scientists favored habitats, yet all stakeholders were concerned about the role of economic activities in contributing to environmental degradation. Yet, survey participants had difficulties with interpreting the photos of ecosystem services as intended, an indication that the ES framework commits to a nature-culture dualism and displaces other ways of ordering human and other-than-human relations, particularly those present throughout the Global South. We argue that ecosystem services research is best treated as a situated practice where researcher and research participants jointly produce intended and unintended results and outcomes.",2021,,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,26,2,,WOS:000668219400010,10.5751/ES-12253-260224,,#19489,Hunter 2021,,
Can the Ecosystem Approach Improve Management of Tropical Estuarine Fisheries for Diadromous Species?,"Blaber, SJM","The general acceptance that individual fisheries should be managed in the context of the ecosystem of which the target species are a part has led to the paradigm of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). Such management may be particularly suitable,2 for diadromous fishes, which spend time in rivers, estuaries, and the sea, because their sustainability Would benefit front a holistic approach. The extent to which this is possible and has been successful depends on a wide variety of biological, socioeconomic, and political factors. Fishing in all its forms is only one of a broad at-ray of human activities in rivers, estuaries, and the coastal zone; hence, diadromous fisheries management requires not only integration across ecosystems, but also its inclusion in overall planning processes. Tropical diadromous fisheries in developing countries suffer from overfishing, lack of adequate human resources to manage the fisheries, insufficient scientific data for sound management and decision making, lack of monitoring capabilities, poor enforcement of laws, inefficient administration, and increasing conflicts between different types Of users. Even in developed Countries, many of these issues also have not been addressed.

Patterns of connectivity among populations of a coral reef fish,"Chittaro, PM; Hogan, JD","Knowledge of the patterns and scale of connectivity among populations is essential for the effective management of species, but our understanding is still poor for marine species. We used otolith microchemistry of newly settled bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) in the Mesoamerican Reef System (MRS), Western Caribbean, to investigate patterns of connectivity among populations over 2 years. First, we assessed spatial and temporal variability in trace elemental concentrations from the otolith edge to make a 'chemical map' of potential source reef(s) in the region. Significant otolith chemical differences were detected at three spatial scales (within-atoll, between-atolls, and region-wide), such that individuals were classified to locations with moderate (52 % jackknife classification) to high (99 %) accuracy. Most sites at Turneffe Atoll, Belize showed significant temporal variability in otolith concentrations on the scale of 1-2 months. Using a maximum likelihood approach, we estimated the natal source of larvae recruiting to reefs across the MRS by comparing 'natal' chemical signatures from the otolith of recruits to the 'chemical map' of potential source reef(s). Our results indicated that populations at both Turneffe Atoll and Banco Chinchorro supply a substantial amount of individuals to their own reefs (i.e., self-recruitment) and thus emphasize that marine conservation and management in the MRS region would benefit from localized management efforts as well as international cooperation.",2013,,CORAL REEFS,32,2,341-354,WOS:000318567900003,10.1007/s00338-012-0990-0,,#19493,Chittaro 2013,,
Artisanal Fisher Association Leaders' Estimates of Poaching in Their Exclusive Access Management Areas,"Romero, P; Estevez, RA; Gelcich, S","In marine environments, poaching can become a key threat to marine ecosystem conservation. Poaching can occur in marine protected areas and/or in fishery management areas. Unfortunately, understanding the magnitude and characteristics of poaching under community based and co-management governance schemes in coastal and marine environments, has not received the attention it deserves. In Chile, a system of Territorial Users Rights for Fisheries (TURF) has been recognized as one of the largest experiences of small-scale fisheries co-management at a global scale. Currently, poaching is one of the main threats to the TURF system in Chile. In this article, we assessed poaching of a highly valuable benthic resource (Concholepas concholepas) from TURF management areas. We estimated artisanal fisher association leaders' perceptions of poaching within their TURFs and explore determinants of poaching for Concholepas concholepas. Poaching of Concholepas concholepas showed differences along the studied sites. As expected, the greater abundance of Concholepas concholepas in the management areas generates an increased incentive to poach. Areas that make the greatest investment in surveillance are those most affected by poaching. However, our study cannot determine the effectiveness of current levels of surveillance on illegal extraction. Results show older areas tend to reduce the levels of illegal extraction, which could indicate a greater capacity and experience to control poaching. Supporting fisher associations in enforcing TURFs and following up on sanctions against perpetrators are conditioning factors, highlighted by fisher leaders, for TURF sustainability.

Using Ostrom's principles to assess institutional dynamics of conservation: Lessons from a marine protected area in Brazil,"Tebet, G; Trimble, M; Medeiros, RP","The success of protected areas as a management tool for biodiversity conservation remains as a challenge, and broader approaches for protected area management have been proposed. Considering biodiversity conservation as an issue of the commons and within the realm of social-ecological systems is a promising alternative. In Brazil protected areas are under a State management regime, ruled by the National System of Conservation Units. The Ecological Station of Guaraquecaba (ESG) is a no-take protected area located in the Paranagua Estuarine Complex, surrounded by traditional communities. In this article, Ostrom's design principles were adapted to assess the institutional dynamics of this protected area management, during two periods. Research methods included semi-structured interviews, participant observation and document analysis. During the first period, management actions were oriented to prevent the conversion of forest areas into anthropic occupations. The second period originated in 2000 with the creation of the National System of Conservation Units, which established more precise management tools and mechanisms for participatory decision making. In both periods there was low fulfillment of Ostrom's principles. The main changes over time were the creation of the ESG management council as a conflict-resolution mechanism, and an increase in the recognition of the rights of local communities. Yet, only three of the eight principles are totally present in the current institutional arrangement (well-defined boundaries, conflict-resolution mechanisms, and minimal recognition of rights).

Formulating and applying generalisations on scuba diving experience and its effects could assist the management of diving destinations around the world.

The study assessed and compared the influence of scuba diving experience at two study areas in Italy and Mozambique. Scuba divers (N = 499) participated in a survey of diver segmentation, experience, and perceptions. The influence of diving experience on perceptions was determined using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Experienced divers provided positive self-assessments, were less satisfied with dive sites' health and management, and viewed the impacts of scuba diving activities less critically than novice divers. Scuba diving experience exerted similar influences on divers, regardless of the study area. However, remarkable differences also emerged between the study areas.

"CITIZEN SCIENTISTS AND MARINE RESEARCH: VOLUNTEER PARTICIPANTS, THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS, AND PROJECTION FOR THE FUTURE","Thiel, M; Penna-Diaz, MA; Luna-Jorquera, G; Salas, S; Sellanes, J; Stotz, W","The field of citizen science is flourishing, and although terrestrial projects are more visible, in recent years thousands of volunteers have actively participated in marine research activities. These volunteers (also termed 'citizen scientists') may have experience in the research in which they are participating, but they have no formal degree in marine science or related topics. The participation of large numbers of volunteers with variable educational or professional backgrounds poses particular challenges for the professional scientists coordinating such research. Knowledge about the structure of these projects, the research activities conducted by citizen scientists, and quality control of data collected by volunteers is essential to identify their contribution to marine science. We examined 227 published studies in which professional scientists collaborated with volunteers in a wide range of marine investigations. Most studies focused on a diverse assemblage of animals, followed by flora and other topics (e.g., contamination or beach dynamics). Seabirds, marine mammals, turtles, and fishes were the most commonly studied animals, but several studies also dealt with marine invertebrates. Many of the studied taxa were commercially important, emblematic, or endangered species. Surveys of invasive species took advantage of the extensive spatial scale that can be covered by large numbers of volunteers. As would be expected, the research activities of citizen scientists were concentrated in easily accessible coastal habitats, including sandy beaches, estuaries, coral reefs, and seagrass beds. Hot spots of marine citizen science projects (CSPs) were found not only in North America and Europe, but also in the Indo-West Pacific region. Contributions made by citizen scientists were equally based on incidental observations as on standardized surveys. Some of the research projects had been active for more than a decade, but most were midterm programmes, lasting a few years or less. Volunteer participants came from a wide range of demographic backgrounds. Usually, the participants were adults of both sexes, but a few studies considered either only men or only women (mainly in small fishing communities). Whereas several studies were based on schoolchildren as volunteers, no study worked specifically with senior citizens. The educational level of participants, often not explicitly mentioned in the publications, was also diverse. Some projects selected participants based on their experiences, skills, or profession, but in the majority of the studies, there was either no selection or no information was provided, suggesting that any interested citizen could participate. The preparation of participants ranged from brief written or oral instructions to extensive (weeks) training sessions with professional experts. In general, training effort increased with the complexity of the tasks conducted by volunteers, a crucial element being the adjustment of simple methodologies to the capabilities of participants. Studies for which volunteers needed to identify many different species and estimate their abundances were considered the most complex tasks, and subsequent analysis of such studies by professional scientists must consider inherent bias or shortcomings. About half of the examined studies included some type of quality control to ensure that the data collected by citizen scientists met the standards of rigorous scientific studies. Several authors emphasized that data quality increased with the duration of project participation.Efforts therefore should be made to retain experienced volunteers over time, which is facilitated when volunteers perceive that their efforts lead to something of practical use, such as publications, conservation initiatives, management decisions, or policy actions. Participants seemed to value personal satisfaction and public recognition, but learning about the ocean was also important. The coordinators of marine CSPs often collaborated with organizations such as conservation groups, birdwatchers, dive associations, or fishermen's cooperatives to recruit volunteers, but media campaigns, personal communication, social media, and functional websites were also important. Some studies were based on small numbers of participants (e.g., artisanal fishermen); others involved thousands of volunteers (e.g., coral or litter surveys). Volunteer-generated data contributed information about population dynamics, health, or distribution of marine organisms and supported long-term monitoring programmes of marine protected areas, harmful algal blooms, or marine litter, among others. In general, the contribution of citizen scientists greatly enhances research capacity, providing an increased workforce over extensive spatial and intensive temporal scales at comparatively moderate costs. Citizen science is able to make significant contributions to marine science, where professional scientific activities are limited by the available human resources. Considering the vastness of the oceans and the diversity of habitats, communities, and species, proper understanding of this realm requires intensive research activities over time and space. This recognition should lead to increased consideration of citizen science as a powerful tool for the generation and spread of scientific knowledge. Furthermore, sharing knowledge between volunteer participants and professional scientists improves communication, trust, and capacity building, facilitating efficient collaboration in much-needed conservation initiatives.",2014,,"OCEANOGRAPHY AND MARINE BIOLOGY: AN ANNUAL REVIEW, VOL 52",52,,257-314,WOS:000350304100006,10.1201/b17143,,#19500,Thiel 2014,,REVIEW ARTICLE
"Fish, food security and health in Pacific Island countries and territories: a systematic literature review","Charlton, KE; Russell, J; Gorman, E; Hanich, Q; Delisle, A; Campbell, B; Bell, J","Background: Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) face a double burden of disease, with a high prevalence of household food insecurity and childhood micronutrient deficiencies, accompanied by a burgeoning increase in adult obesity, diabetes and heart disease.Methods: A systematic literature review was undertaken to assess whether increased availability of, and access to, fish improves a) household food security and b) individual nutritional status.Results: A total of 29 studies were reviewed. Fourteen studies identified fish as the primary food source for Pacific Islanders and five studies reported fish/seafood as the primary source of dietary protein. Fish consumption varied by cultural sub-region and Pacific Island countries and territories. Fish consumption and nutritional status was addressed in nine studies, reporting moderate iodine deficiency in Vanuatu where only 30 % of participants consumed mostly fresh fish. Similarly, the degree to which Pacific Islanders depended on fishing for household income and livelihood varied between and within PICTs. For more economically developed countries, household income was derived increasingly from salaried work and dependency on fishing activities has been declining.Conclusions: Fishing remains a major contributor to food security in PICTs, through subsistence production and income generation. However, there is a paucity of research aimed at assessing how maintaining and/or improving fish consumption benefits the diets and health of Pacific Islanders as they contend with the ongoing nutrition transition that is characterised by an increasing demand for packaged imported foods, such as canned meats, instant noodles, cereals, rice, and sugar-sweetened beverages, with subsequent decreased consumption of locally-produced plants and animals.",2016,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,16,,,WOS:000372824600002,10.1186/s12889-016-2953-9,,#19502,Charlton 2016,,
Conservation and the right to fish: International conservation NGOs and the implementation of the Voluntary Guidelines for securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries,"Singleton, RL; Allison, EH; Le Billon, P; Sumaila, UR","The Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and. Poverty Eradication (SSF-Guidelines) were agreed with extensive input from small-scale fishers themselves, and hold great promise for enhancing both small-scale fishers' human rights and fisheries sustainability in a meaningful and context relevant manner. However, this promise will not be fulfilled without continued input from fishing communities as the SSF-Guidelines are implemented. This paper proposes that international conservation NGOs, with their extensive geographical and political networks, can act as a conduit for communication between small-scale fishing communities and other parties and thus catalyse implementation of the Guidelines. In order to do so, they will first need to demonstrate a genuine commitment to people-as-well-as parks and the human rights based approach espoused in the SSF-Guidelines. This paper reviews current engagement of international conservation NGOs with human rights in fisheries; looks at their potential motivations for doing more; and identifies challenges in the way. It concludes with a proposal for how international conservation NGOs could play a critical part in catalysing the implementation of the SSF-Guidelines.",2017,,MARINE POLICY,84,,22-32,WOS:000413279900003,10.1016/j.marpol.2017.06.026,,#19504,Singleton 2017,,
"Whale-Watching Management: Assessment of Sustainable Governance in Uramba Bahia Malaga National Natural Park, Valle del Cauca","Soto-Cortes, LV; Luna-Acosta, A; Maya, DL","As the growth of the whale-watching activity increases rapidly around the world, the challenge of responsible management and sustainability also rises. Without suitable management, operators may try to maximize their own profits by breaking the rules, which may negatively affect cetaceans. In this paper, the applicability of conditions for sustainability governance in humpback whale-watching was evaluated. To achieve this purpose, semi-structured interviews were conducted in Uramba Bahia Malaga National Natural Park, Colombia. Results of this study showed that humpback whale-watching is characterized by unevenness in connections with markets, income inequality and the distribution of operators across several villages and cities. The combination of which restricts cooperation between operators. Nevertheless, there are informal agreements among the operators, and some operators are motivated to form associations. Besides, environmental entities have been responsible of regulation in lack of community-based management. However, this still does not achieve effective enforcement of the rules. Stakeholders (communities and government authorities) must mediate trust and reciprocity among operators to improve the situation. It is important to involve all operators to fill gaps in the limited government monitoring capacity and absence of sanctions. This is relevant to continue monitoring the evolution of the whale-watching in this and other Marine Protected Areas, so that the sustainability of the activity is not affected in the future.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000623890300001,10.3389/fmars.2021.575866,,#19505,Soto-Cortes 2021,,
Recreational fishers' support for no-take marine reserves is high and increases with reserve age,"Navarro, M; Kragt, ME; Hailu, A; Langlois, TJ","No-take marine reserves are essential for scientific monitoring, likely to contribute to the sustainability of targeted species, help to buffer biodiversity loss due to climate change impacts, and provide public education, tourism and diverse economic benefits to local communities. However, the establishment of no-take marine reserves has been a contentious policy in several countries because of a perception that recreational fishers are opposed to reserves. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether negative perceptions about reserves are widespread amongst recreational fishers, and whether perceptions change after the reserve has been created. In this study, recreational fishers were surveyed in ten Australian marine parks to determine levels of support and beliefs about the benefits and costs of no-take marine reserves. A 'space-for-time' approach was used to explore whether support is higher in older reserves. The results suggest that most recreational fishers who fish in established marine parks are supportive of the no-take marine reserves within them. On average, 63.3% of fishers support no-take marine reserves in their marine park, and 17.8% are opposed. Further, recreational fishers' support for no-take marine reserves increases markedly with reserve age. This research indicates that most recreational fishers are supportive of no-take marine reserves within marine parks and that support increases over time.",2018,,MARINE POLICY,96,,44-52,WOS:000447104100007,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.06.021,,#19506,Navarro 2018,,
Transboundary Pollution in the New Legally Binding Instrument under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea The case for anthropogenic underwater noise,"IEEE; Reeve, LLN","The United Nations General Assembly has initiated a process to negotiate a new legally binding instrument to establish a framework for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ). These negotiations are taking place pursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (the Convention or UNCLOS), which entered into force in 1994 as the overall legal charter for regulating and managing all activities in the ocean, with the exception of military associated operations. The Convention places the responsibility for environmental protection in the ocean upon the governments of State Parties acting individually and cooperatively through international organizations.This new BBNJ instrument will implement the mandates of the Convention in line with existing international law. Four elements make up the proposed provisions under discussion: environmental impact assessments (EIA) for activities with the potential to cause significant adverse impacts; area-based management tools (ABMT), including marine protected areas; marine genetic resources, including questions of the sharing of benefits; and capacity building and the transfer of marine technology. The elements for EIA and ABMT have the most pertinent application to the international management of transboundary pollution.Anthropogenic underwater noise pollution and other transboundary pollutants are significant and growing threats to the health of the components of BBNJ; the new instrument represents the most promising opportunity to manage these threats. This paper proposes legal mechanisms for the incorporation into the new instrument requirements for consideration of the adverse impacts of all transboundary pollution, with noise as a case study, focusing on the elements for environmental impact assessments and area-based management tools.",2019,,OCEANS 2019 MTS/IEEE SEATTLE,,,,WOS:000534568500218,,,#19510,IEEE 2019,,
Fish spawning aggregations: where well-placed management actions can yield big benefits for fisheries and conservation,"Erisman, B; Heyman, W; Kobara, S; Ezer, T; Pittman, S; Aburto-Oropeza, O; Nemeth, RS","Marine ecosystem management has traditionally been divided between fisheries management and biodiversity conservation approaches, and the merging of these disparate agendas has proven difficult. Here, we offer a pathway that can unite fishers, scientists, resource managers and conservationists towards a single vision for some areas of the ocean where small investments in management can offer disproportionately large benefits to fisheries and biodiversity conservation. Specifically, we provide a series of evidenced-based arguments that support an urgent need to recognize fish spawning aggregations (FSAs) as a focal point for fisheries management and conservation on a global scale, with a particular emphasis placed on the protection of multispecies FSA sites. We illustrate that these sites serve as productivity hotspots - small areas of the ocean that are dictated by the interactions between physical forces and geomorphology, attract multiple species to reproduce in large numbers and support food web dynamics, ecosystem health and robust fisheries. FSAs are comparable in vulnerability, importance and magnificence to breeding aggregations of seabirds, sea turtles and whales yet they receive insufficient attention and are declining worldwide. Numerous case-studies confirm that protected aggregations do recover to benefit fisheries through increases in fish biomass, catch rates and larval recruitment at fished sites. The small size and spatio-temporal predictability of FSAs allow monitoring, assessment and enforcement to be scaled down while benefits of protection scale up to entire populations. Fishers intuitively understand the linkages between protecting FSAs and healthy fisheries and thus tend to support their protection.",2017,,FISH AND FISHERIES,18,1,128-144,WOS:000396407200009,10.1111/faf.12132,,#19511,Erisman 2017,,
Strategies for conservation planning and management of terrestrial ecosystems in small islands (exemplified for the Macaronesian islands),"Fernandes, JP; Guiomar, N; Gil, A","The present paper addresses the conservation planning and management issues of terrestrial ecosystems with particular insight to small islands (with examples of application in the Macaronesian archipelagos of Cape Verde, Canaries, Madeira and Azores). It analyses specific conservation planning and management approaches and proposes concrete characterization and evaluation frameworks able to support decision and management processes ensuring an active and participative involvement of all concerned stakeholders. These methodological perspectives involve not only new paradigmatic approaches to the process of characterization and evaluation of environmental elements and processes as well as their use and disturbance through land use, but also regarding the individual and collective perspectives regarding benefice and supporting management behaviours. Some examples from islands of the Macaronesian archipelagos, in particular Pico in the archipelago of Azores and Santiago in the Cape Verde archipelago, are used to illustrate some possible management approaches, involving the consideration of the entire island as a conservation object and mobilizing their actors (individuals, groups, administrations or other organizations) as conscious, participative stakeholders. These examples involve possible land use and management changes and trade-off processes specific to each island that are listed and explained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These fish spawning aggregations (FSAs) can be highly vulnerable to concentrated fishing pressure, which can have detrimental effects on entire stocks and ecosystems. There has been only limited research and management attention on FSAs in the U.S. GOM. We synthesized available information on FSA locations, spawning seasonality, and fisheries management for 28 regionally important species known or likely to form FSAs in the U.S. GOM. We identified and mapped 22 multi-species FSA sites which all fall within areas predicted from recently published FSA distribution models. But the number of known sites is probably far less than the number that actually exist. Only three of the 22 (13%) FSA sites were located within no-take marine protected areas and none were in state waters. Management measures (e.g., seasonal closures or gear restrictions) to protect spawning fishes are also limited, particularly in state waters. We recommend expanded cooperative research efforts to characterize FSAs in the U.S. GOM in order to assist managers in prioritizing sites and seasons for additional protection. Important multi-species FSAs can be incorporated in a network of monitored and managed ""sentinel"" sites. These efforts should build stakeholder engagement in the management process, generate data that can be used to improve fisheries stock assessments, contribute to developing ecosystem-based fisheries management approaches, and confer resilience to important fisheries stocks and ecosystems of the U.S. GOM.",2019,,MARINE POLICY,109,,,WOS:000497592800009,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103689,,#19515,Heyman 2019,,
Evaluating management performance of marine protected area networks in the Philippines,"Horigue, V; Alino, PM; Pressey, RL","In the Philippines, formation of MPA networks is seen as a means to improve management of existing MPAs by forging collaborative partnerships among local governments to coordinate initiatives and share information and resources. Although forging partnerships is widely advocated because of the beliefs of the benefits it brings, there is very little empirical evidence about the management performance of MPA networks, and the extent to which networks enhance the management of individual MPAs. In this paper, we present measures of the management performance of collaborative partnerships to coordinate management of MPA networks. To evaluate performance of MPA networks managed by multiple governance units, we used a combination of quantitative and qualitative survey tools (e.g. performance assessment tools, interviews, perception surveys), and synthesized the results using a scoring rubric and analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. We evaluated three MPA networks in the Philippines with different sizes, histories, and objectives to test our research methods. We found that our approach improved overall evaluation of the performance of MPA networks and individual MPAs. Moreover, our analysis for each MPA network showed different combinations of outcomes, highlighting the importance of using a suite of research methods and tools. We found that MPA networks furthered the development and effectiveness of spatial management in the Philippines. However, the objectives of the collaborative partnerships, their histories, and the diversity and complexity of governance (e.g. more diverse interests with increasing number of participating institutions) had a mixed effect on the management of networks and of individual MPAs. The outcomes of this research provide an approach to evaluating management performance that can facilitate the establishment and strengthening of MPA networks in areas similar to the Philippines with multiple governance units and complex social, economic, and political contexts.

Charting the course for a blue economy in Peru: a research agenda,"McKinley, E; Aller-Rojas, O; Hattam, C; Germond-Duret, C; San Martin, IV; Hopkins, CR; Aponte, H; Potts, T","Ocean- and coastal-based economic activities are increasingly recognised as key drivers for supporting global economies. This move towards the ""blue economy"" is becoming globally widespread, with the recognition that if ocean-based activities are to be sustainable, they will need to move beyond solely extractive and exploitative endeavours, aligning more closely with marine conservation and effective marine spatial planning. In this paper we define the ""blue economy"" as a ""platform for strategic, integrated and participatory coastal and ocean development and protection that incorporates a low carbon economy, the ecosystem approach and human well-being through advancing regional industries, services and activities"". In Peru, while the seas contribute greatly to the national economy, the full potential of the blue economy has yet to be realised. This paper presents the findings of an early career scientist workshop in Lima, Peru, in March 2016. The workshop ""Advancing Green Growth in Peru"" brought together researchers to identify challenges and opportunities for green growth across three Peruvian economic sectors-tourism, transport and the blue economy with this paper exploring in detail the priorities generated from the ""blue economy"" stream. These priorities include themes such as marine spatial planning, detailed evaluations of existing maritime industries (e.g. guano collection and fisheries), development of an effective MPA network, support for sustainable coastal tourism, and better inclusion of social science disciplines in understanding societal and political support for a Peruvian blue economy. In addition, the paper discusses the research requirements associated with these priorities.

Co-management of coral reef fisheries: A critical evaluation of the literature,"Wamukota, AW; Cinner, JE; McClanahan, TR","In many parts of the world, inshore marine resources are being increasingly managed through collaborative arrangements between communities, governments, civil society and other groups. However, co-management of fisheries has had a mixture of successes and failures. Theorists and applied researchers have suggested a series of preconditions or factors thought to improve the chances of successful common-pool resource management. These include common property institutional design principles and their contextual conditions. Using a variety of web-based English keyword searches, published literature on community-based management and co-management of coral reefs was systematically reviewed with the view of determining if and how studies were evaluating these management systems as well as the extent to which critical aspects of common property theory were investigated and tested. Based on a screening of 600 and full evaluation of 157 journal articles, four measures of ecological conditions and five measures of contextual condition improvement were examined or could be evaluated with the data presented in 38 papers, which examined 49 co-management projects. Fewer than half of the 49 studies met the inclusion criteria of the analyses for documenting key design principles or contextual conditions. Additionally, most projects did not systematically report on contextual conditions, common property design principles and measures of success. The analysis demonstrates the large theoretical and empirical gaps in the evaluation of these management systems and begs for a more scientific, critical and multivariate approach.

We interviewed fishers, community leaders and government fisheries officers regarding (1) their perceptions about different fisheries restrictions, (2) their socio-economic conditions, and (3) the institutional design and rules of the CCP arrangements. Fishers had low levels of education (<4 years) and biweekly expenditures of around US$100, and they were permanent residents of their villages, being part of large households (9-12 members). Apart from effort restrictions, respondents' perceptions were similar and strongly supported a range of fisheries regulations, particularly gear and minimum size restrictions. The suggested minimum size of captured fish was 20.6 cm (SD 3.0), whereas the suggested size of closed areas was 8.4 km(2) (SD 2.0). Fishers associated with community or conservation groups generally had more positive views of spatial closures and other less-preferred management restrictions.

Identifying Indicators to Evaluate Community-Managed Freshwater Protected Areas in the Lower Mekong Basin: A Review of Marine and Freshwater Examples,"Loury, EK; Ainsley, SM","Protected areas are frequently established as a management tool to conserve terrestrial and aquatic habitats and species. Monitoring and evaluation are a necessary part of adaptive management to determine whether such protected areas are effectively meeting their objectives. While numerous initiatives have developed methods to evaluate terrestrial and marine protected areas (MPAs), similar efforts and resources are lacking for freshwater protected areas (FPAs), which have become widespread as a community-based fisheries management approach in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB). This review summarizes published literature on the evaluation of marine and freshwater protected areas to provide guidance on the evaluation of community-managed FPAs in the LMB. Specifically, the review examines several indicators related to common objectives of aquatic protected areas and provides considerations for measuring these indicators in the context of community-managed freshwater protected areas in the LMB. Key conclusions include that first, FPAs should be established with clearly defined objectives, and these objectives should inform the selection of indicators for evaluation. Second, indicators identified for MPAs are highly relevant to FPAs, although methods may require adaptation to a freshwater environment. Finally, socioeconomic and governance indicators are overlooked in both MPA and FPA evaluations compared to biophysical indicators, and interdisciplinary assessment teams could ensure these indicators receive adequate consideration.",2020,,WATER,12,12,,WOS:000602787300001,10.3390/w12123530,,#19523,Loury 2020,,
Invasive alien plants in marine protected areas: the Spartina anglica affair in the European Wadden Sea,"Nehring, S; Hesse, KJ","The common cord-grass Spartina anglica, a fertile hybrid of S. maritima and S. alterniflora, was planted in the European Wadden Sea extensively during the late 1920s and 1930s to promote sediment accretion. After establishment, it colonised as a pioneer plant in the upper tidal zone, where it occurs frequently in coherent swards at the seaward front of saltmarshes and in patches on the tidal flats. Often, a conspicuous, almost monotypic, belt of S. anglica is formed. Over the last two decades, an increase in abundance and accelerated spread of S. anglica was observed, possibly promoted by warmer spring temperatures. This alien species may benefit from global warming, and there is considerable concern about its harmful impacts on the native biocoenoses and native biodiversity of the unique Wadden Sea ecosystem, encompassing effects on hydromorphodynamics and coastal protection. For a definitive assessment, however, an adequate quantification and comparison of documented and potential effects of S. anglica is important, but currently unavailable.

Symbolic consultation and cultural simplification in the establishment of an Indonesian national park and its impacts on local livelihoods,"Meilani, M; Andayani, W; Faida, LRW; Susanti, FD; Myers, R; Maryudi, A","This paper analyzes the processes by which the Sebangau National Park in Central Kalimantan (Indonesia) was established, along with the management activities implemented and the impacts of such activities on local communities. Employing an environmental justice lens, which revolved around procedural, recognition, and distribution issues, we found that local communities were not adequately consulted or involved in the establishment and management of the national park. Furthermore, approaches to mitigate the adverse impacts failed to fully consider the diverse cultures and customs with different livelihood strategies surrounding the park. The research also found that the options made available for local livelihoods were limited and did not meet specific needs and demands of certain ethnic groups. Overall, the transformation of the Sebangau production forest into a conservation area significantly disrupted local livelihoods and led to pronounced adverse economic, social, and cultural impacts. Thus, adequate attention to environmental justice must be made if park authorities are to improve the social acceptability of the national park. They should meaningfully engage the local communities in decision-making procedures related to park management, because they are directly impacted by the park. The authorities should also understand the different sociocultural aspects related to the local people surrounding the park and their different needs and livelihood strategies. Finally, the livelihood alternatives should be carefully assessed, and locals should be adequately consulted to ensure that these are socially and culturally accepted.",2021,,FOREST AND SOCIETY,5,2,494-505,WOS:000710951000001,10.24259/fs.v5i2.11875,,#19526,Meilani 2021,,

The study was conducted through self-administered survey questionnaires, interviews, observations as well as review of relevant literature and archival records. The objective was to understand the perceptions of the local people regarding performance of the water governance of the Songkhla Lake Basin in order to support a wider research assessing the water governance performance of the Lake Basin. The local people perceived the governance performance as below average and highlighted some pertinent challenges such as institutional and agency fragmentation, weak coordination and integration as well as enforcement and compliance. They suggested that governance performance could be improved if these issues were resolved and if the local people were involved in the governance of the Lake Basin. The study concluded with recommendations to integrate local people's perceptions in governance and management decision-making as well as highlighting some issues that arose from the study like a single formal management and policy harmonization organization for the Basin and livelihood support for the local people to reduce environmental degradation.

Adaptive capacity of marine comanagement: a comparative analysis of the influence of colonial legacies and integrated traditional governance on outcomes in the Pacific,"Quimby, B; Levine, A","Integrating traditional institutions into marine resource comanagement has become common across the Pacific. However, these arrangements can link village-based and centralized governance systems in many ways, resulting in new hybridized institutional organizations, operational scales, and governance process. Examining the context-specific social, cultural, and historical processes that shape these programs can reveal how systems for comanagement develop, and how institutional differences influence adaptive capacity. Using analytical tools drawn from critical institutionalism and broad institutional perspectives, we assess how different institutional histories and processes of hybridization informed the adaptive capacity of two comanagement programs in Samoa: the Community-Based Fisheries Management Programme (CBFMP) and the Marine Protected Area (MPA) program. While the programs were embedded in similar cultural and ecological contexts, the MPA program became inactive following the 2009 Pacific tsunami, while the CBFMP endured. In spite of early efforts to involve communities in the MPA program's development, the institutional history and organization of the program's managing agency informed an interpretation of comanagement principles that did not adequately incorporate traditional Samoan institutions for coastal management, reducing its adaptive capacity. In contrast, the CBFMP gained resilience through its fundamental integration with village-based social and political institutions, social norms, and values. This analysis of institutional histories, structures, and program outcomes demonstrates that colonial legacies pose obstacles for successful hybridized governance in the Pacific, while also confirming the valuable contributions integrated traditional institutions can make to improving adaptive capacity.",2021,,REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE,21,1,,WOS:000606418200001,10.1007/s10113-020-01730-6,,#19529,Quimby 2021,,
Conservation of the Eastern Taiwan Strait Chinese White Dolphin (Sousa chinensis): Fishers' Perspectives and Management Implications,"Liu, TK; Wang, YC; Chuang, LZH; Chen, CH","The abundance of the eastern Taiwan Strait (ETS) population of the Chinese white dolphin (Sousa chinensis) has been estimated to be less than 100 individuals. It is categorized as critically endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Thus, immediate measures of conservation should be taken to protect it from extinction. Currently, the Taiwanese government plans to designate its habitat as a Major Wildlife Habitat (MWH), a type of marine protected area (MPA) for conservation of wildlife species. Although the designation allows continuing the current exploitation, however, it may cause conflicts among multiple stakeholders with competing interests. The study is to explore the attitude and opinions among the stakeholders in order to better manage the MPA. This study employs a semistructured interview and a questionnaire survey of local fishers. Results from interviews indicated that the subsistence of fishers remains a major problem. It was found that stakeholders have different perceptions of the fishers' attitude towards conservation and also thought that the fishery-related law enforcement could be difficult. Quantitative survey showed that fishers are generally positive towards the conservation of the Chinese white dolphin but are less willing to participate in the planning process. Most fishers considered temporary fishing closure as feasible for conservation. The results of this study provide recommendations for future efforts towards the goal of better conservation for this endangered species.",2016,,PLOS ONE,11,8,,WOS:000381471100054,10.1371/journal.pone.0161321,,#19530,Liu 2016,,
Assessing the impact of fisheries co-management interventions in developing countries: A meta-analysis,"Evans, L; Cherrett, N; Pemsl, D","Co-management is now established as a mainstream approach to small-scale fisheries management across the developing world. A comprehensive review of 204 potential cases reveals a lack of impact assessments of fisheries co-management. This study reports on a meta-analysis of the impact of fisheries co-management in developing countries in 90 sites across 29 case-studies. The top five most frequently measured process indicators are participation, influence, rule compliance, control over resources, and conflict. The top five most frequently measured outcome indicators are access to resources, resource well-being, fishery yield, household well-being, and household income. To deal with the diversity of the 52 indicators measured and the different ways these data are collected and analysed, we apply a coding system to capture change over time. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that, overall fisheries co-management delivers benefits to end-users through improvements in key process and outcome indicators. However, the dataset as a whole is constituted primarily of data from the Philippines. When we exclude this body of work, few generalisations can be made about the impact of fisheries co-management The lack of comparative data suitable for impact assessment and the difficulties in comparing data and generalising across countries and regions reiterates calls in other fields for more systematic approaches to understanding and evaluating governance frameworks.

Engagement in co-management of marine benthic resources influences environmental perceptions of artisanal fishers,"Gelcich, S; Kaiser, MJ; Castilla, JC; Edwards-Jones, G","The perceptions of resource users towards any conservation policy can be a major determinant of its success. While co-management policy can enhance the management of fisheries, to date there have been few reports concerning how engagement in co-management regimes may affect fishers' perceptions. This paper assesses the determinants of fishers' environmental perceptions within a co-management regime in Chile. Group meetings and structured questionnaires showed fishers' environmental perceptions were composed of four domains of concern, termed 'water pollution', 'stock conservation', 'conservation/profit trade-offs' and 'charismatic species'. Fishers' dependence on diving and/or the length of time fishers had engaged with the policy affected their perceptions of each of these domains. Perceptions of the 'water pollution' domain were related to length of time fishers had participated in co-management, probably because fishers gained an increased understanding of the market and its need for unpolluted produce. Attitudes towards 'conservation/profit trade-offs' tended to become linked to an increasingly conservation-oriented ethic with increasing time of engagement with the policy. Given that the length of time fishers engaged with co-management differentially affected fishers' perceptions of environmental domains of concern, public officials and funding agencies should be careful not to judge co-management prematurely. It takes time to educate participants and overcome distrust. Through co-management processes in Chile, fishers' environmental awareness increased, and sustainable behaviours may consequently increase in the future.",2008,,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,35,1,36-45,WOS:000256710100007,10.1017/S0376892908004475,,#19533,Gelcich 2008,,
"When push comes to shove in recreational fishing compliance, think 'nudge'","Mackay, M; Jennings, S; van Putten, EI; Sibly, H; Yamazaki, S","Enforcing compliance with rules and regulations in recreational fisheries has proved difficult due to factors such as the high number of participants and costs of enforcement, the absence of regular monitoring of recreational fishing activity, and the inherent difficulties in accurately determining catch levels. The effectiveness of traditional punitive deterrence is limited, yet current management is heavily reliant on this compliance approach. In this paper, the potential of behavioural based management is considered through a narrative review of the relevant literature; specifically, exploring the use of nudges, which aim through subtle changes and indirect suggestion to make certain decisions more salient, thereby improving voluntary compliance. This concept is explored with specific reference to the compliance of fishers within Australian recreational fisheries. There are only a few examples of behavioural based approaches found. However, based on their theoretical foundations, nudges may represent an inexpensive, and potentially highly effective tool for recreational fisheries management. Nudges do not offer a 'quick fix' to cases where traditional policy instruments have failed. Rather, there is the potential for behavioural nudges (based on framing, changing the physical environment, presenting default options, and social norms) to augment and complement existing deterrence regimes. A number of potential nudges for compliance management in recreational fisheries are suggested, but caution is advised. As with any novel management approach, nudges must be rigorously tested to demonstrate their cost-effectiveness and to avoid unintended consequences.",2018,,MARINE POLICY,95,,256-266,WOS:000442190400029,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.05.026,,#19534,Mackay 2018,,
Analysis and global research trends on nautical tourism and green coastal infrastructures: the case of coral reefs and seagrass meadows,"Caparros-Martinez, JL; Martinez-Vazquez, RM; Valenciano, JD","Background This article aims to analyse the scientific production related to the impact worldwide of recreational and sports tourism on the conservation and management of coast and marine green infrastructures. To this end, the research focuses on two of the ecosystems, where this type of tourism exerts pressure on a global scale: seagrass meadows and coral reefs. Based on Scopus and WoS databases, different levels of analysis have been carried through the application of bibliometrics to identify the most prevalent topics and future research trends. Results The main results are summarised as follows. On the one hand, many publications in the scientific sector analyse how tourism and recreational activity affect specific marine ecosystems, especially coral reefs. On the other hand, the phenomenon of Global Change and the social and environmental effects on marine ecosystems with significant tourism potential have been identified as one of the most studied research topics. Finally, emerging research trends have been identified, including environmental monitoring and tracking programs aimed at controlling tourism, aspects related to the participation of the population and local tourism sectors, and the role of ecotourism in marine protected areas. Conclusions In conclusion, a greater commitment from the public administration and a greater social awareness of the ecosystem services it generates is needed. If the species and the natural environment are not conserved and protected, the tourist attractiveness of these areas would be lost and, ultimately, the tourism of the area would change, with the consequent loss of well-being for the whole community.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE,34,1,,WOS:000778478400002,10.1186/s12302-022-00614-2,,#19539,Caparros-Martinez 2022,,
Species composition and turnover models provide robust approximations of biodiversity in marine conservation planning,"Stephenson, F; Leathwick, JR; Geange, S; Moilanen, A; Pitcher, CR; Lundquist, CJ","Robust design of Marine Protected Areas in ocean environments is often challenging due to inadequate knowledge of biodiversity patterns, reflecting difficulties in the prediction of species distributions from sampling data that are often sparse or inadequate. Models that combine species and environmental data, such as Gradient Forests (GF), provide one analytical approach to this problem, efficiently combining available information to produce spatial models of species turnover throughout an area of interest. Spatial estimates of species turnover can then be classified to estimate spatial patterns in species composition; however, the performance of GF-based classifications within a conservation planning context has not previously been evaluated. Here we assess the utility for conservation planning (using the software Zonation) of a GF-based hierarchical classification that summarises spatial patterns in demersal fish composition in the oceans around New Zealand. Progressively more complex Zonation analyses assessed the effects of (i) varying the number of classification groups, (ii) adding information describing species turnover, and (iii) adding information describing spatial variation in demersal fish species richness. The best-performing GF-based conservation ranking used layers describing the distributions of 30 classification groups, demersal fish species turnover between these groups, and species richness. Conservation outcomes from this ranking were only marginally less efficient than those from a more conventional ranking that used 217 individual species distribution layers (7% less efficient). This indicates that GF-based classifications may provide a practical alternative for marine conservation planning. Additional advantages arise from the greater ease with which a single classification layer summarising complex biodiversity patterns can facilitate decision-making in participatory stakeholder processes.",2021,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,212,,,WOS:000703857800002,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105855,,#19540,Stephenson 2021,,
"""Overarching sustainability objectives overcome incompatible directions in the Common Fisheries Policy""","Goti-Aralucea, L; Fitzpatrick, M; Doring, R; Reid, D; Mumford, J; Rindorf, A","The lack of clarity in the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) must be addressed to create a more efficient balance across diverse ecological, economic and social dimensions. Particularly economic and social objectives present at an overarching level must be made explicit and addressed in lower level management measures, in order to link them to biological objectives and allow policy to build a balance across types of objectives. Selecting clear objectives is essential, particularly for policy impact assessment. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how more specific high level objectives to managing fisheries can be derived from stakeholders. The paper first reviews the definition of objectives, from a historical and conceptual perspective. Secondly, it discusses the issues of manageability and acceptability, and finally describes an articulation of the high level objectives derived from extensive stakeholder consultations at European and regional level. The results from workshops at the European level to identify objectives were further examined at regional level for the Baltic and North Seas in additional individual consultations. The German case addresses two seas (Baltic and North Seas), has a complex governance structure (due to federalism) and significant roles for the three types of actors (industry, government and environmental NGOs). The analysis suggests that establishing higher level sustainability objectives within the CFP can help diverse interest groups to develop a consensus on management actions to meet complex social goals.",2018,,MARINE POLICY,91,,49-57,WOS:000429393500007,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.02.006,,#19542,Goti-Aralucea 2018,,

Current literature on engagement predominantly focuses on individual case studies or specific geographical contexts, making general conclusions regarding the effect of these efforts on conservation outcomes difficult. We reviewed evidence from the peer-reviewed and grey literatures related to the role of stakeholder engagement (both externally-driven and self-organized engagement) in biodiversity conservation at the local scale using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. We critically appraised and extracted data using mixed methods for case studies (n = 82) and meta-analyses (n = 31) published from 2011 to 2015. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis on background literature references published from 2000 to 2016 (n = 283). The quantitative analysis assessed multiple variables, and yielded no significant results, but suggested a possible relationship between success in producing attitudinal change towards conservation and four engagement factors. Our qualitative analysis identified six dimensions of engagement processes that are critical for successful outcomes when a project is externally-driven, and suggests that understanding of governance and social-cultural context plays an important role in all types of stakeholder engagement efforts. Finally, we reflect on the effectiveness of relying primarily on evidence available from published literature to understand links between conservation and stakeholder engagement, in particular with regard to self-organized engagement.

Evaluation of Rehabilitation Strategies and Management Schemes for the Improvement of Mangrove Management Programs in Lingayen Gulf,"Salmo, SG; Torio, DD; Esteban, JMA","We evaluated the mangrove rehabilitation strategies and management schemes in five municipalities in Lingayen Gulf (Bolinao, Anda, Bani, Alaminos and San Fernando). Mangrove planting appears to be the first and only option used in the area, ignoring other recommended management strategies, e. g. conservation, landscaping, and sustainable production. All planting sites were located in coastal fringes and are mostly monospeficic stands of the species Rhizophora mucronata. The planted mangroves were constrained by low seedling survival and stunted growth as probably caused by poor species-substrate matching, mono-species planting and pest infestations. Three management schemes were noted: community-managed (Bolinao and Anda), local government unit (LGU)-managed (Alaminos and San Fernando), and co-managed between the LGU and the community (Bani). The community-managed mangrove areas have the benefits of voluntary efforts from community-based organizations in conducting daily management activities but were constrained with budgetary and logistical concerns. In contrast, both LGU-managed and co-managed areas received institutional and logistical supports from their respective municipal governments, but lacking community participation made mangrove management difficult. Almost two decades of mangrove management indeed helped improved the mangrove forest condition, at least in terms of forest structure. These projects demonstrated some level of success but also encountered several setbacks. Several lessons can be derived from these areas that can help improve the mangrove rehabilitation and management approaches in Lingayen Gulf. Among the recommendations are: (1) provide ordinance enacting the remaining natural secondary growth mangroves as marine protected areas, (2) promote planting in former mangrove areas by reverting abandoned, idled and unproductive aquaculture ponds to mangroves; (3) improve management schemes by formulating resource management plan, institutionalizing annual budget allocation, enhancing community participation, and enhancing tenurial instrument; and (4) incorporate periodic project evaluation.",2007,,SCIENCE DILIMAN,19,1,24-34,WOS:000217851800005,,,#19545,Salmo 2007,,

Human-induced gradients of reef fish declines in the Hawaiian Archipelago viewed through the lens of traditional management boundaries,"Friedlander, AM; Donovan, MK; Stamoulis, KA; Williams, ID; Brown, EK; Conklin, EJ; DeMartini, EE; Rodgers, KS; Sparks, RT; Walsh, WJ","Large declines in reef fish populations in Hawaii have raised concerns about the sustainability of these resources, and the ecosystem as a whole. To help elucidate the reasons behind these declines, a comprehensive examination of reef fish assemblages was conducted across the entire 2500km Hawaiian Archipelago.Twenty-five datasets were compiled, representing >25 000 individual surveys conducted throughout Hawaii since 2000. To account for overall differences in survey methods, conversion factors were created to standardize among methods.Comparisons of major targeted resource species (N=35) between the densely populated main (MHI) and remote north-western Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) revealed that 40% of these species had biomass in the MHI below 25% of NWHI levels. In total, 54% of the species examined had biomass <50% of NWHI biomass.The moku or district was a basic unit of resource management in pre-contact Hawaii and was used as a unit of spatial stratification for comparisons within the MHI. Biomass of resource species was negatively correlated with human population density within moku boundaries, with extremely low biomass in areas with highest human population densities. No such relationship was found for species not targeted by fishing.A number of remote areas with small human populations in the MHI still support high standing stock of fished species, and these areas are likely important refugia for maintaining fisheries production and biodiversity functioning.These results highlight the large gradient of human impacts on fish assemblages across the Hawaiian Archipelago and the potential in using landscape and seascape units, such as those that are watershed and bio-physically-based, when managing in part based on a framework of traditional ecological knowledge.",2018,,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,28,1,146-157,WOS:000425121900015,10.1002/aqc.2832,,#19547,Friedlander 2018,,
Sport fisheries: Opportunities and challenges for diversifying coastal livelihoods in the Pacific,"Wood, AL; Butler, JRA; Sheaves, M; Wani, J","High population growth rates and poverty are likely to elevate the vulnerability of many coastal communities in the Pacific region to climate change. Alternative livelihood strategies which can generate income and simultaneously conserve fish stocks and their habitats are a priority. This paper investigates the feasibility of 'sport fishing' (recreational catch and release angling for particular species of predatory game fish) as such a strategy. The limited research of sport fisheries in developing countries is augmented with a review of community-based ecotourism, integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) and common property management literature to propose design principles. Five prerequisite principles for the success of sport fishery enterprises are suggested. First, adequate local capacity must be available to manage a tourism business and facilities, supported by cross-scale co-management amongst stakeholders. Second, appropriate governance arrangements must be in place to ensure the equitable dispersal of benefits to all members of the local community, and conflict resolution. Third, resource-ownership boundaries and rights must be clearly delineated before the enterprise begins in order to minimise the potential for future conflict. Fourth, social, biodiversity and ecosystem service co-benefits should result from the enterprise. These should include improvements in income, health, education, food security, the status of the target and non-target species and their habitat and non-fishery ecosystem services. Fifth, monitoring and evaluation of these principles is required within an adaptive co-management framework which takes a social-ecological systems approach and includes all stakeholders in social learning and power-sharing. Through this, broader impacts of the enterprise may emerge which go beyond the standard assessment of ecotourism and ICDP success in financial or biodiversity terms. These principles now need to be tested by researching the experiences of case studies of sport fishing enterprises in the Pacific. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper reviews and analyses the drivers of these changes, and makes recommendations for the future management of SSF. From the biological standpoint, the use of fishing gears that actively select certain species, sizes and sexes, the deployment of fishing gears on certain fragile habitats, the loss of fishing gears and the use of non-native species as bait are examples of how SSFs can threaten the sustainability of vulnerable coastal species and habitats. From a socioeconomic perspective, several factors are altering the traditional characteristics of coastal SSF. Among the most important is the growth of recreational fisheries in coastal waters and the disappearance of traditional low technology fisheries or their substitution by more mechanised, technical fisheries, which is leading to a loss of the traditional ecological knowledge held by artisanal fishers. On the other hand, the increasing competition between artisanal and recreational fisheries, and between them and commercial fishing operations, are also altering the classical features of coastal fisheries in some European countries. SSFs must adapt to the requirements of the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), namely management based on Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), multi-annual management plans and ecosystem based principles. It is concluded that it is necessary to integrate different assessment approaches (biological, social and economic), with active participation from stakeholders, governments and relevant research institutions, to better evaluate and manage coastal fisheries.",2018,,MARINE POLICY,98,,176-186,WOS:000454467100021,10.1016/j.marpol.2016.11.007,,#19549,Lloret 2018,,
"Management of gillnet fisheries in the south coast of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil","Mendonca, JT; Pereira, ALC","Gillnetting is one of the most practiced fishing methods adopted in the South of Brazil and has been increasingly expanding over the last years. This paper presents the characterization of the activity and discusses its management, in accordance to results from the discussions on the development of regulations on net fisheries in the South Coast Marine Protected Area (APAMLS) in the state of Sao Paulo. Gillnet fleets are formed by small-scale boats, with low autonomy, and lower fishing capacity, when compared to boats from other ports in the South and Southeast. However, the number of fishing units is high, reaching 1,709 units operating in the South coast of Sao Paulo in 2010. This kind of fleet uses several types of gillnets, and the activity may be classified according to the fishery type (industrial, coastal artisanal and estuarine artisanal). The activity was discussed in the APAMLS and the fishing industry, with the participation of all segments, and a proposal for gillnetting regulation was reached. The results suggested that gillnet length for industrial fisheries should be reduced by 30%. It must be emphasized that without effective inspection measures leading the fishing industry to believe in the enforcement of the proposal, private interests of the most influential political sectors may cause the process to retrocede.",2014,,ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS,86,3,1227-1237,WOS:000342063300018,10.1590/0001-3765201420130139,,#19550,Mendonca 2014,,
Maneuvering towards adaptive co-management in a coral reef fishery,"Hunter, CE; Lauer, M; Levine, A; Holbrook, S; Rassweiler, A","Tropical coral reef ecosystems in the Pacific region are degrading rapidly as ocean temperatures rise and local anthropogenic stressors increase. In this context of rapid change, effective site-based management of coral reef fisheries necessitates flexible environmental governance that is closely attuned to the needs of multiple stakeholders who depend on the fishery for income, food, and cultural identity. As such, many practitioners and scholars call for adaptive co-management of coral reef fisheries where local resource users play a primary role in environmental governance with the support of flexible institutions that operate across organizational scales. This article describes the history and evaluates the current status of marine governance in Moorea, French Polynesia. Established in 2004, the management framework is under revision because it has failed to meet its ecological objectives and has generated discontent among many stakeholders. Drawing on household surveys, interviews, and archival information, the challenges to as well as the factors that may enable a more successful transition of the current governance arrangement towards co-management are detailed. It is argued that recent social mobilization, subsistence and cultural links to the fishery, the presence of geographically and socially relevant traditional governance boundaries, and the implementation of co-management in other parts of French Polynesia are positive factors. However, lack of trust between stakeholders, social heterogeneity, disruption of traditional cultural institutions and practices, minimal institutional support, and an uncertain legal framework suggest that there are significant headwinds for maneuvering towards successful co-management in Moorea.",2018,,MARINE POLICY,98,,77-84,WOS:000454467100009,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.09.016,,#19551,Hunter 2018,,
Negotiating the Use of Biodiversity in Marine Areas beyond National Jurisdiction,"Blasiak, R; Pittman, J; Yagi, N; Sugino, H","A relatively small group of states is disproportionately active in marine areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), raising questions of equity, while a myriad of sectoral regulations and guidelines spread across multiple international bodies has led to uneven conservation and use of biological diversity and resources in these areas. Within this context, the UN General Assembly resolved in 2015 to begin negotiations on an international legally-binding instrument to conserve and protect biodiversity in ABNJ, with the negotiations framed by four issues: (1) marine genetic resources, including questions on the sharing of benefits; (2) measures such as area-based management tools, including marine protected areas; (3) environmental impact assessments; (4) capacity building and the transfer of marine technology. Yet our analysis demonstrates that least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS) are significantly under-represented in regional and international meetings on such issues, while the authorship of academic literature on these topics is dominated to an unusual extent by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member states (97%). Statistical analysis of delegation statements delivered during the first round of negotiations following the UN General Assembly resolution also illustrates that the interests of OECD member states differ substantially from LDCs and SIDS, suggesting that imbalanced representation has the potential to result in skewed negotiations. Moreover, the restriction on negotiating parties not to undermine the mandate of existing organizations limits their maneuverability, and may hamper progress toward achieving ambitious time-bound commitments to promote sustainable resource use and reduce inequality (e.g., under the Sustainable Development Goals and Aichi Targets). With ABNJ covering half the world's surface, self-interested compliance with new regulations is the most promising pathway to conservation and sustainable use, yet remains unlikely unless states feel their views, concerns and best interests have been reflected in the negotiated agreement.",2016,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,3,,,WOS:000457358000220,10.3389/fmars.2016.00224,,#19552,Blasiak 2016,,
Decision triggers are a critical part of evidence-based conservation,"Cook, CN; de Bie, K; Keith, DA; Addison, PFE","Conservation managers face complex decisions about if, when and how to intervene in managed systems. To support these decisions, approaches are needed that utilise the best available evidence to guide actions when a system is moving into an undesirable state. Assigning some form of critical threshold that if crossed would trigger action (a decision trigger) is growing in favour in the scientific community. Likewise, there is increasing interest from the conservation management community in using decision triggers as part of evidence-based management. In this article, we reinforce calls for the use of decision triggers and highlight how they can complement many approaches for evidence-based conservation. There are many benefits to using decision triggers to link evidence to action. For management organisations, decision triggers offer a way to improve the clarity and transparency of management decisions. There has been recent progress in developing methods to set robust decision triggers that utilise rigorous biological monitoring data, such as receiver operating characteristic curves, control charts and participatory modelling. When monitoring data are not readily available, approaches that set decision triggers based on utility thresholds (i.e., value-based judgements) or expert elicitation methods, and refine trigger points over time, hold promise. Despite the many benefits, there remain challenges for both developing and implementing decision triggers. There is a pressing need for a process that can guide organisations in setting defensible decision triggers based on the best available science, and that can be used for a wide range of management contexts. We believe decision triggers can be integrated into existing management processes within organisations to improve decisions about when and how to act to protect biodiversity, and to support managers to achieve evidence-based conservation.

The role of scientific advice in the management of benthic fisheries in Mexico: Present status and perspectives,"Arreguin-Sanchez, F","In many countries, traditional scientific guidance for fisheries management has been based on the population dynamics of the target stocks. Most research developed for management occurs in response to the necessity of protecting stocks from evident overfishing and loss of recruitment. To accomplish this, different strategies have been implemented through specific management measures. The complexity of analytical tools varies according to the degree of knowledge required, from general, simple population-dynamics studies to formal and complex simulation experiments, including risk and uncertainty analyses. Other management initiatives requiring scientific advice are stock conservation strategies such as fishery closures, use of excluder devices, and natural reserves and protected areas. Recently, an ecosystem-based approach has been instituted as an alternative available for management strategies. However, even though this new approach offers more information upon which to base decisions, ecosystem-based management requires participation of all ecosystem users, including fishing fleets, which sometimes results in negative benefits for some stakeholders in order to improve ecosystem health, fishery yields, or stock recovery. The ecosystem approach also is used to evaluate the impact of fishing on the dynamics and structure of ecosystems that experience strong fishing effort. In this paper, I discuss scientific work that seeks to promote ecosystem health, conservation, and sustainable exploitation as common goals of research and management. 1 illustrate this approach by discussing fisheries from the littoral zone of Mexico. Several misleading scientific concepts presently form the basis for fisheries management in Mexico, and these have precipitated serious consequences for the stocks to which they are applied. These concepts include (a) the idea that fish produce eggs in excess, (b) the belief that allowing fish to reproduce at least once during their lifetime is sufficient to maintain recruitment levels, and (c) the assumption of constant natural mortality in fish stocks. Discussion of these concepts yields the conclusion that marine protected areas are probably the best choice when the goal is to manage Mexico's benthic fisheries for sustainability.",2005,,BENTHIC HABITATS AND THE EFFECTS OF FISHING,41,,59-71,WOS:000232152900005,,,#19555,Arreguin-Sanchez 2005,,
Genetic variation in Irish Sea brown crab (Cancer pagurus L.): implications for local and regional management,"McKeown, NJ; Watson, HV; Coscia, I; Wootton, E; Ironside, JE","Understanding demographic processes over multiple spatial scales is vital for the optimization of conservation/management strategies, particularly for commercially harvested taxa such as the brown crab (Cancer pagurus L). Brown crab population genetic structure was investigated at (i) a local scale within the Irish Sea, which included comparisons with the Lundy No Take Zone (NTZ) and (ii) across the NE Atlantic. The results indicate that the brown crab does not exhibit strong spatial structure either within the Irish Sea or at the regional level, suggesting high gene flow within and among the Irish Sea, English Channel and North Sea. Comparisons between the Lundy NTZ and harvested areas revealed similarly high levels of genetic diversity. An intriguing result was that the Lundy NTZ sample exhibited a degree of genetic patchiness (ephemeral geographically unpatterned differentiation) which may indicate elevated recruitment skews within the NTZ. Overall, the results support the view that brown crabs within the sampled area belong to a single genetically panmictic stock and that if breeding stock sizes are maintained genetic drift will not be strong enough to reduce neutral genetic diversity. The highly connected nature of this species requires international cooperation for sustainable management, an important component of which will be the application of more powerful population genomic approaches to assess finer scale aspects of stock structure as well drivers of genetic patchiness reported for the species. This is a timely consideration in light of potential future misalignments between biological and geopolitical stock boundaries in the Irish Sea following Brexit.",2019,,JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM,99,4,879-886,WOS:000474835600016,10.1017/S0025315418000632,,#19556,McKeown 2019,,
Mitochondrial phylogeography reveals high haplotype diversity and unique genetic lineage in Indian dugongs (Dugong dugon),"Srinivas, Y; Pande, A; Gole, S; Jothi, PVRP; Magesh, KM; Pathan, S; Dudhat, S; Shekar, R; Ghanekar, C; Kukadia, D; Johnson, JA; Mondol, S; Sivakumar, K","1. India plays a significant role in dugong conservation by having the largest population within South Asia. The status of dugongs in India is largely unknown due to a paucity of reliable ecological data. This study generated mitochondrial control region sequences from similar to 10% of dugong individuals from existing populations within India. Furthermore, data generated in this study were compared with the global data to assess genetic lineages, population structure, and genetic diversity of Indian populations.2. Multiple analyses suggest that the Indian dugong populations are part of a single genetic cluster, comprising South Asia, North-west Indian Ocean, and South-west Indian Ocean populations. Despite small population size, they retain high genetic diversity with unique mitochondrial DNA haplotypes within South Asia. Within India, novel haplotypes are observed from all dugong habitats sampled, with overall high haplotype diversity (0.85 +/- 0.04) but low nucleotide diversity (0.005 +/- 0.001). Indian populations exhibit genetic differentiation with higher within-population variance (63.41%) than among populations (36.59%). Two of the haplotypes observed in India are shared with Sri Lanka, implying genetic connectivity between these populations.3. The genetic data from Indian dugong populations provide critical insights into the identification of dugong corridors and important dugong conservation zones in India. We suggest site-specific interventions, including the creation of new marine protected areas and boundary reorganization and expansion of other existing protected areas, to ensure population connectivity. In addition, simultaneous efforts towards seagrass meadow restoration, reduction of dugong mortalities, and community participation in dugong conservation are recommended for population recovery of this threatened marine herbivore.",2021,,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,31,4,818-829,WOS:000600790700001,10.1002/aqc.3490,,#19557,Srinivas 2021,,
THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF COASTAL ICHTHYOPLANKTON ASSEMBLAGES OFF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,"Suntsov, A; Koslow, JA; Watson, W","We examined the assemblage structure of the coastal ichthyoplankton off central and southern California in relation to depth and region, based on data from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI), the Los Angeles County Museum, monitoring of coastal power plants, and other sources. Point Conception was a transition region for ichthyoplankton from San Francisco to San Diego, with distinct depth-related ichthyoplankton assemblages north and south of Point Conception. Northern and southern shallow assemblages were dominated by larval gobies (Gobi-idae), with Acanthogobius flavimanus and Lepidogobius lepidus more important in the north and Gillichthys mirabilis in the south. The more offshore assemblage north of Point Conception was dominated by a variety of larval sculpins (Cottidae), while there was greater influence from several croaker species (Sciaenidae) in the Southern California Bight (SCB). There was a faunal transition zone at 15-22 m depth in the SCB. The shallow larval assemblages were primarily characterized by demersally spawning species, while species with planktonic eggs were generally found more offshore. Analysis of several coastal data sets suggested that ichthyoplankton programs may target distinct larval assemblages even within the relatively narrow coastal zone and that such differences may be more pronounced during certain seasons. Our results have important implications for marine spatial planning and for monitoring coastal marine protected areas.",2012,,CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS,53,,153-170,WOS:000312039800012,,,#19559,Suntsov 2012,,
Socio-economic implications of the KwaZulu-Natal sardine run for local indigenous communities,"Myeza, J; Mason, RB; Peddemors, VM","The economic and social effects of the annual sardine run on the indigenous community on the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, were assessed using data gathered from questionnaires and personal interviews with 329 members of the community. Their knowledge, perceptions and attitudes about the sardine run, as well as their level of involvement in, and the financial benefits accrued from it, were also assessed. Although around two-thirds of those interviewed were aware of the sardine run and just over half participated in it, only some 17% benefited financially from it. However, despite this low level of participation, the financial benefit to the community could amount to R17-18 million, and as much as R34-54 million if a multiplier effect of 2-3 is applied. There was a high level (over 70%) of willingness to learn more about the event, and to become more involved in training exercises that would allow local people to take advantage of opportunities arising from the sardine run.

"Vulnerability assessment of ecological conditions in Seribu Islands, Indonesia","Farhan, AR; Lim, S","The sustainability in the marine and coastal environment was conceptualized significantly since the Earth Summit in 1992 where Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) was proposed as one of the solutions that can support the decision makers to work together and provide decisive actions for the better coastal management. A right balance between the socio-economic growth and the environmental protection is the most important goal in the coastal management. In order to achieve the goal, a framework-based strategy, financial planning and policy enforcement must be implemented in the coastal management.Indonesia as one of the archipelagic states has adopted this concept within two Indonesian cooperation laws which were intended to enable the Indonesian government to manage the coastal areas more responsibly and accountably in the aim for the improved environment for future generations. Since the endorsement of those laws, however, the implementation has been lagging and the Indonesia government's focus is rather on the land-based development despite the consequence of the negligence in the coastal management. This is evident in the impact on the coastal environment that is caused by rapid and ill-planned developments in Indonesian coastal regions. As a result, Indonesia already lost four islands associated with Seribu Islands by 1999. It proves that Seribu Islands lack in the policy enforcement and were unnoticed by both the central government and the local government.This paper aims to assess the ecological vulnerability with a focus on coral reefs in Seribu Islands using Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing technologies. From the study results, it can be summarized that the urban pressures and pollutants from four main rivers in Jakarta Bay and Banten Province played a significant role in the environmental degradation. Most of the islands associated with Seribu Islands are at risk, if the urban development continues. The vulnerability analysis of Seribu Islands can assist the decision makers to prepare pivotal actions in order to adapt the changes and develop essential recovery programs for the region.

The Coral Triangle Initiative and regional exchanges: Strengthening capacity through a regional learning network,"Pietri, DM; Stevenson, TC; Christie, P","Natural resource management and conservation programs that promote building capacity and social learning among participants often lead to the formation of learning networks: a type of social network where learning is both a goal and potential outcome of the network. Through forming relationships and sharing information, participants in a learning network build social capital that can help a network achieve social and environmental goals. In this study, we explored social capital in a learning network that emerged through a large-scale marine governance effort, the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries, and Food Security. Through a mixture of social network analysis and key informant interviews, we examined the major patterns of information exchange among individuals who had participated in regional learning exchanges; evaluated whether the network's structure resulted in information sharing; and considered implications for strengthening network sustainability, capacity building, and learning. We found that the Regional Exchange network fostered information sharing among participants across national and organizational boundaries. While the network had individuals who were more central to information sharing, the network structure was generally decentralized, indicating potential resilience to changes in leadership and membership. Participants stressed the importance of the knowledge and connections they had acquired through the learning network; however, they expressed doubts regarding its sustainability and stressed the need for a strong coordinating entity. Our findings suggest that conservation learning networks have the ability to bridge cultural divides and promote social learning; however, a strong network coordinator and continuing efforts to support information sharing and learning are crucial to the network's strength and sustainability. The tangible learning and capacity development outcomes cultivated through Regional Exchange network underscore the value of and need to invest in conservation networks that support peer-to-peer learning.

"An assessment of participation, catch and effort in the offshore boat-based linefishery in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","Dunlop, SW; Mann, BQ","This study evaluates trends in participation, catch and effort in the KwaZulu-Natal offshore boat-based linefishery. Methods used included a random access-point survey and an associated questionnaire survey. The study was undertaken between February 2009 and April 2010. Total participation in all sectors (recreational, charter and commercial) ranged between 18 217 and 20 546 boat-fishers and between 2 582 and 3 326 boats. Similarly, total fisher effort in the offshore linefishery was estimated at 39 664 boat-outings y(-1). The commercial boat sector had the highest catch per unit effort (CPUE) both numerically (307.4 fish outing(-1)) and by weight (235.6 kg outing(-1)). In contrasting, the recreational boat sector had the lowest CPUE both numerically (8.6 fish outing(-1)) and by weight (15.0 kg outing(-1)). In total, 86 fish species, belonging to 27 families, were recorded in catches of boat-fishers (all sectors) during the study period. Catch composition was similar with Chrysoblephus puniceus, Chrysoblephus anglicus and Lethrinus nebulosus being represented in the top five species of all three fishery sectors. Analysis of overall CPUE, catch composition and total catch of the offshore boat-based linefishery in KZN suggested that the fishery is currently in a relatively stable condition and that little change has occurred over the past 13 years. However, specific CPUE values from this study together with those reported in the literature suggest that some species may be severely overexploited. It is recommended that stock assessments of the priority species should be conducted in the near future and steps should be taken to encourage rebuilding of overexploited species. This must include urgent regulation of the burgeoning charter boat-fishery as well as increased attempts to establish more marine protected areas.",2013,,AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE,35,1,79-97,WOS:000318980800010,10.2989/1814232X.2013.769907,,#19566,Dunlop 2013,,OUTSIDE OF MPA
Small Scale Fisheries Management: Lessons from Cockle Harvesters in Nicaragua and Tanzania,"Crawford, B; Herrera, MD; Hernandez, N; Leclair, CR; Jiddawi, N; Masumbuko, S; Haws, M","The role of women in gleaning fisheries tends to be underestimated and poorly documented although they play an important role in coastal food security and income generation. This article describes two initiatives for co-management of women dominated cockle (Anadara spp.) fisheries implemented in Zanzibar Island of Tanzania and in Nicaragua that were based on a Fiji model. In each case, significant progress was made at the pilot scale but required adaptation to the community and national context. The Nicaragua case resulted in increasing densities of cockles inside and outside small scale no-take zones in a small estuary after a two-year period of implementation. In Zanzibar, out of several no-take sites established on reef flats, only one showed similar results. Other sites' poor performance is likely due to poor site selection, small size, and non-compliance. Varying degrees of poaching affected both locations and continues to be an issue. In Zanzibar, local and national government played highly supporting roles whereas in Nicaragua, local government was supportive but national government continues to exhibit top-down decision-making, while still evaluating the alternative co-management approach. In both cases, university extension initiatives were influential in building community capacity for management and playing an advocacy role with national government.

Views of management effectiveness in tropical reef fisheries,"McClanahan, TR; Darling, ES; Mangubhai, S; Gurney, GG; Lestari, WP; Fox, M; Jupiter, SD; Yulistianti, DA; Muthiga, NA; D'agata, S","The effectiveness and outcomes of management are expected to improve when people are informed, engaged and influential in governance and management procedures. The social-ecological and demographic contexts should, however, influence an individual's perceptions and willingness to engage and access appreciable benefits from management. To evaluate how engagement, procedures and perceived outcomes varied with geographic and social-ecological context, we asked 1582 heads-of-households in 38 fishing villages in four tropical countries to evaluate the benefits of their local fisheries management. Responses to 10 collective action, social performance and management procedure questions fell along three response axes, namely (a) the potential benefits of management, (b) resource status and the reliability of yields and (c) the respondents' ability to influence management decisions. Respondents were most positive about the organization of the existing management systems but more sceptical about their ability to influence decision-making and subsequent yields and resource status. More frequent negative opinions increased with urbanization (distance to cities and population density), which could arise from challenges of group cohesion, local control and subsequent management efficacy. Consequently, we argue that some common rural, decentralized, or collective fisheries management systems are inappropriate for engaging participation in urban contexts. Across all locations, there is a need to increase participation with management decisions and actions, and to transparently evaluate and respond to resource and yield outcomes. Crafting recommendations appropriate for urban contexts will be increasingly relevant as urbanization and commercialized fisheries expand in tropical countries.",2021,,FISH AND FISHERIES,22,5,1085-1104,WOS:000653669600001,10.1111/faf.12570,,#19568,McClanahan 2021,,
Reconciling complex system models and fisheries advice: Practical examples and leads,"Lehuta, S; Girardin, R; Mahevas, S; Travers-Trolet, M; Vermard, Y","The move toward an ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) requires new operational tools in order to support management decisions. Among them, ecosystem-and fisheries-based models are critical to quantitatively predict the consequences of future scenarios by integrating available knowledge about the ecosystem across different scales. Despite increasing development of these complex system models in the last decades, their operational use is still currently limited in Europe. Many guidelines are already available to help the development of complex system models for advice yet they are often ignored. We identified three main impediments to the use of complex system models for decision support: (1) their very complexity which is a source of uncertainty; (2) their lack of credibility, (3) and the challenge of communicating/transferring complex results to decision makers not accustomed to deal with multivariate uncertain results. In this paper, we illustrate these somehow theoretical ""best practices"" with tangible successful examples, which can help the transfer of complex system models from academic science to operational advice. We first focus on handling uncertainty by optimizing model complexity with regards to management objectives and technical issues. We then list up methods, such as transparent documentation and performance evaluation, to increase confidence in complex system models. Finally, we review how and where complex system models could fit within existing institutional and legal settings of the current European fisheries decision framework. We highlight where changes are required to allow for the operational use of complex system models. All methods and approaches proposed are illustrated with successful examples from fisheries science or other disciplines.

Unity or Fragmentation in the Deep Blue: Choices in Institutional Design for Marine Biological Diversity in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction,"Berry, DS","Delegations are in the final stages of negotiating the proposed Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement or Agreement). The Agreement will have tremendous scope. Geographically it covers all ocean areas beyond national jurisdiction, meaning approximately 60 percent of the earth's surface. Substantively it deals with a range of complex topics necessary for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, including marine genetic resources, sharing of benefits, measures such as area-based management tools, including marine protected areas, environmental impact assessments and capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology. Existing scholarship primarily explores the substantive choices for the Agreement; little examines its proposed institutional structure. This article critically assesses the competing positions advanced during negotiations for the Agreement's institutional structure - the 'global' and 'regional' positions - and reviews the middle, or 'compromise' position adopted by the draft text. It suggests that both global and regional actors will be necessary to conserve and sustainably use marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, and that some form of coordinating mechanism is required to allocate responsibility for particular tasks. Two principles are proposed for use in combination to provide a mechanism to help coordinate Agreement organs (global) and regional or sectoral bodies, namely, the principles of subsidiarity and cooperation. These principles are found in existing international and regional structures but are advanced here in dynamic forms, allowing for temporary or quasi-permanent allocation of competences, which can change or evolve over time. This position is also grounded in the international law of treaties and furthers dynamic views of regional and global ocean governance by offering practical coordinating principles that work with the existing Agreement text.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000726183800001,10.3389/fmars.2021.761552,,#19572,Berry 2021,,
Coupling remote sensing with in situ surveys to determine reef fish habitat associations for the design of marine protected areas,"Goodell, W; Stamoulis, KA; Friedlander, AM","Nearshore fish populations are in decline in the main Hawaiian Islands, and effective, sustainable management is needed. There has been increasing emphasis on the value of eco-system-based management and the conservation of essential fish habitat, but policy is encumbered by a lack of supporting information. This study uses science and technology to support traditional knowledge in identifying juvenile fish habitats, providing a basis for effective resource management in a rural Hawaiian community. Building on existing local knowledge of nearshore resources, we quantitatively assessed juvenile fish-habitat associations. We conducted fine-scale in situ ecological surveys of juvenile reef fishes and their habitats, and produced detailed benthic habitat maps using GIS and interpretation of satellite imagery, from which we extracted multiscale seascape variables. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to assess fish-habitat relationships at multiple scales. Depth, coral cover, structural complexity, scattered rock and coral habitat, and distance to shore emerged as primary factors associated with juvenile reef fish abundance. We identified the habitat associations of 2 important food resource species in the study area of H (a) over bar' ena, Kaua'i: the convict tang Acanthurus triostegus sandvicensis, an endemic subspecies, and the redlip parrotfish Scarus rubroviolaceus. Results from this study played an important role in the successful approval of the H (a) over bar' ena community-based fishery management plan by the state governing agency.

Assessing the applicability of a bottom-up or top-down approach for effective management of a coastal lagoon area,"Ballarini, E; D'Adamo, R; Pazienza, G; Zaggia, L; Vafeidis, A","The coastal lagoon of Lesina, is situated on the Italian southern Adriatic coast, in a primarily rural area.

For this purpose, available social, economic and physical data were gathered, organized and successively used to identify the causes for the lagoon deterioration. We found that the main causes are: increased discharge of sediments and nutrients from inland activities; unmanaged fishing; loss of human capital; unclear regulations due to vertical and horizontal lack of coordination among authorities. Further, three workshops were conducted with local stakeholders to identify the multiple problems affecting the lagoon area and discuss possible shared solutions. The workshops highlighted that participants perceived the lagoon as an unexploited source of income, mostly in terms of nature based tourism, and suggested that negative externalities caused by the inland activities and mismanagement of the fishery sector should be accounted for by the authorities. However, the mapping of stakeholders indicates that the tourist sector in the area is not developed enough to effectively promote in a bottom-up fashion the development of a management plan of the lagoon area, which could encourage sustainable tourism by protecting the lagoon and generating economic development for the area.",2021,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,200,,,WOS:000612810100002,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105417,,#19574,Ballarini 2021,,
Effect of the creation of a marine protected area on populations of Coral Trout in the coral triangle region,"Chung, FC; Komilus, CF; Mustafa, S","Reef fish respond differently to reserve protection. The abundance and biomass of sedentary species and those with limited mobility should be higher inside the marine reserve and decline with increased distance from the center of the reserve. Reserve protection reduces fishing mortality and allows recovery or maintains fish population abundance within the reserve. We assessed the effects of protection on reef fish, including three species of Coral Trout (Plectropomus spp.), and hard coral cover at a marine reserve surrounding Lankayan Island, Sabah Malaysia, after 11 years of a 'no-take' policy. Underwater visual census conducted at 8 closed sites and 4 open sites indicated that total reef fish biomass and abundance, and Plectropomus spp. biomass were significantly higher inside the reserve. Eleven years of no-take policy appears to maintain Plectropomus spp. biomass up to 5 km from the reserve center. Hard coral cover influenced reef fish abundance and biomass but it did not affect the presence of Plectropomus spp. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of a no-take marine reserve not only requires consideration of ecological connectivity, reserve size and location, but also socio-economic factors including compliance, enforcement availability and community participation to achieve greater benefits.

Inuit food security in canada: arctic marine ethnoecology,"Watts, P; Koutouki, K; Booth, S; Blum, S","Quantitative Seascape Ethnoecology practice is considered through a community-based food security lens.

Addressing Challenges Common to Modern Recreational Fisheries with a Buffet-Style Landscape Management Approach,"van Poorten, BT; Camp, EV","Recreational fisheries management strives to provide satisfying fishing experiences to heterogeneous anglers while conserving fish stocks of varying productivity. Achieving this balance with one-size-fits-all regulatory strategies is challenging; but complex, waterbody-specific regulations may be onerous to anglers and managers. An alternative strategy is a limited but specifically diverse ""buffet"" of regulations across a landscape of discrete fisheries to improve outcomes over existing regulation strategies. This approach is tested using a landscape bioeconomic model with density dependent growth and survival feedbacks in fish populations and dynamic angler behavior. Sources of heterogeneity in angler behavior and biological processes are considered to select and apply an optimal suite of fishing regulations. At a regional level, the buffet-style strategy offers improvements over other management strategies by recognizing tradeoffs among the utility and effort patterns of diverse angler types. Furthermore, these benefits are generally maintained even when limited to only five regulations to ease implementation logistics. Additional requirements for management agencies using the buffet strategy are discussed, such as assessing angler heterogeneity and determining which regulations are implemented on which waters. Some of these challenges may be overcome because this approach is imminently compatible with active-adaptive and cooperative management ideas.",2019,,REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE & AQUACULTURE,27,4,393-416,WOS:000471395000001,10.1080/23308249.2019.1619071,,#19581,vanPoorten 2019,,
The convergence of Integrated Coastal Zone Management and the ecosystems approach,"Forst, MF","The primary role of the Integrated Coastal Zone Management model was to arbitrate conflicts between stakeholders in a living and natural resource environment characterized by a common property and open access doctrine. A chronology of events describes how the development and acceptance of an ecosystems approach policy began to converge and coincide with the spread and development of Integrated Coastal Zone Management. Those organizations that gave representation to the conservation ethic became internationally recognized as surrogate natural resource 'users', the interests of which possessed commonality with all stakeholder interests in general. The tenants of conservation policy were therefore largely employed to decide the merits of disputes over ocean and coastal resources.In the 1990s, scientists created a forum to debate, better define, and institutionalize a sound basis for ecosystem management theory and practice. Protocols were developed that embedded science in living and natural resources planning and management. These protocols were shaped and adopted to serve an evermore contemporary Integrated Coastal Zone Management model. Improvements in methodology include the use of adaptive management, ecological modeling and monitoring, appropriate temporal and spatial scales, salient indicators, and stakeholder participation. This contemporary approach is dependent upon recognizing the benefits inherent in utilizing instruments capable of managing resources on a holistic level. Bioregional planning and zoning accommodate the successful management of resources on this level. It is a direct outcome of the convergence of Integrated Coastal Zone Management and the ecosystems approach.Bioregional zoning schemes are capable of traversing the private property and common property doctrines that define the respective terrestrial and aquatic environments of the coastal zone. A comparative case study of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Belize Marine Protected Area Program is included as an annex, the analysis of which is predicated upon the principles espoused in the literature.

Coping with the extended vulnerability of marine ecosystems: implementing the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries,"Doulman, DJ","The 1995 Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, a landmark voluntary international instrument, seeks to promote change in the way in which fisheries and aquaculture are managed and utilized. Responsible behaviour and accountability are at the heart of the Code. It is intended to be implemented in a holistic and transparent manner by governments and stakeholders in all fisheries situations, irrespective of their locations and scale, and contribute, as a result, to the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) and long-term sustainability. The article commences with discussion of the background to the Code, its scope and structure, the associated instruments that have been concluded within the Code's framework, related instruments and, importantly, the technical guidelines that are elaborated by FAO to support the Code's implementation. The next section addresses FAO's role in monitoring and reporting every second year to the FAO Committee on Fisheries on the Code's implementation. Information for this task is collected from governments, regional fishery bodies and non-government organizations by way of a self-assessment questionnaire. This section is followed by a brief discussion of the precautionary approach and the EAF that focuses on parts of the Code that are intended to implement the EAF. The Reykjavik Declaration and subsequent initiatives to deepen the EAF's implementation are also addressed. Stakeholder participation and the role of marine protected areas in promoting the EAF and sustainability are then considered along with the special requirements of developing countries. Some of FAO's activities that contribute to the implementation of the EAF are highlighted. The conclusion points to the need for governments and stakeholders to sustain ongoing activities to support the Code's implementation and for the international community to continue to provide technical and financial assistance to developing countries to ensure that they are not left behind in the implementation process.",2007,,SOCIAL SCIENCE INFORMATION SUR LES SCIENCES SOCIALES,46,1,189-237,WOS:000245281300009,10.1177/0539018407073665,,#19585,Doulman 2007,,
Effectiveness of shore-based remote camera monitoring for quantifying recreational fisher compliance in marine conservation areas,"Lancaster, D; Dearden, P; Haggarty, DR; Volpe, JP; Ban, NC","1. Marine conservation areas require high levels of compliance to meet conservation objectives, yet little research has assessed compliance quantitatively, especially for recreational fishers. Recreational fishers take 12% of global annual fish catches. With millions of people fishing from small boats, this fishing sector is hard to monitor, making accurate quantification of non-compliance an urgent research priority.2. Shore-based remote camera monitoring was tested for quantifying recreational non-compliance in near-shore, coastal rockfish conservation areas (RCAs) in the Salish Sea, Canada.3. Six high definition trail cameras were used to monitor 42 locations between July and August 2014.4. Seventy-nine percent of monitored conservation area sites showed confirmed or probable fishing activity, with no significant difference in fishing effort inside and outside RCAs.5. Mixed effects generalized linear models were used to test environmental and geographic factors influencing compliance. Sites with greater depth had significantly higher fishing effort, which may imply high, barotrauma-induced, rockfish mortality in RCA sites.6. Non-compliance estimates were similar to aerial fly-over compliance data from 2011, suggesting that trail camera monitoring may be an accurate and affordable alternative method of assessing non-compliance in coastal conservation areas, especially for community-based organizations wishing to monitor local waters.7. widespread non-compliance could compromise the ability of RCAs to protect and rebuild rockfish populations. Increased education, signage, and enforcement is likely to improve compliance.",2017,,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,27,4,804-813,WOS:000408335200009,10.1002/aqc.2736,,#19586,Lancaster 2017,,
A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF INITIATIVES OF ASIA-PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION (APEC) FOR THE BLUE ECONOMY: DEADLOCKS AND ANY POSSIBLE WAY OUT?,"Chen, IJ","The article will critically evaluate Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation's (hereinafter ""APEC) Blue Economy implementations as well as ocean governance of the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (hereinafter ""CPTPP"") Agreement. APEC 's Xiamen Declaration on the Blue Economy pledges to advance sustainable ocean and coastal governance for purposes of fostering economic growth, including scaling up marine protected areas, tackling illegal fishing and facilitating sustainable regional trade in fish. However, the effectiveness of APEC's initiatives for the Blue Economy and its implementation are doubtful due to its talk-shop nature.APEC has performed a reform of disciplining fisheries subsidies which have been a principal factor leading to depleted fishery stocks. By contrast, APEC has been criticized with regard to its inability to complete sensitive or complex goals, such as achieving sustainable development of the Blue Economy. This inability might arise from APEC's de facto institutional character, which shows a lack of an establishing treaty conferring on APEC an international legal personality. Nevertheless, APEC can develop a binding agreement following the example of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) which was initiated by APEC and adopted at the WTO 's 1996 Singapore Ministerial Conference with support from APEC member economies. A recent mega-regional trade agreement in the Asia-Pacific region-CPTPP-would be another possible option for advancing the Blue Economy in the Asia-Pacific region. It is widely recognized that CPTPP has a series of novel and enforceable regulations concerning fishery sustainability. One of the CPTPP's priorities is to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing by placing a restriction on trade. In addition, CPTPP 's environmental chapter contains a binding dispute settlement mechanism. The final section is to refer to the European Union (hereinafter ""EU"") model. The EU is a supranational and regional body with enforceable power. EU fishery regulations could be a model for the Asia-Pacific region in the sense of the substance of its rules. The EU has a more complex rule of regulating fishing and fisheries subsidies, such as the Regulation No. 508/2014 directing EU member states to use European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. This article concludes that the CPTPP turns out to be a better policy choice for advancing the Blue Economy, in comparison with the APEC. With regard to improving CPTPP 's ocean governance, this article suggests to refer to the EU fishery regulations.",2022,,ASIAN JOURNAL OF WTO & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LAW AND POLICY,17,1,85-114,WOS:000779845300004,,,#19588,Chen 2022,,
Simulating the Effects of Alternative Management Measures of Trawl Fisheries in the Central Mediterranean Sea: Application of a Multi-Species Bio-economic Modeling Approach,"Russo, T; D'Andrea, L; Franceschini, S; Accadia, P; Cucco, A; Garofalo, G; Gristine, M; Parisi, A; Quattrocchi, G; Sabatella, RF; Sinerchia, M; Canu, DM; Cataudella, S; Fiorentino, F","In the last decades, the Mediterranean Sea experienced an increasing trend of fish stocks in overfishing status. Therefore, management actions to achieve a more sustainable exploitation of fishery resources are required and compelling. In this study, a spatially explicit multi-species bio-economic modeling approach, namely, SMART, was applied to the case study of central Mediterranean Sea to assess the potential effects of different trawl fisheries management scenarios on the demersal resources. The approach combines multiple modeling components, integrating the best available sets of spatial data about catches and stocks, fishing footprint from vessel monitoring systems (VMS) and economic parameters in order to describe the relationships between fishing effort pattern and impacts on resources and socio-economic consequences. Moreover, SMART takes into account the bi-directional connectivity between spawning and nurseries areas of target species, embedding the outcomes of a larvae transport Lagrangian model and of an empirical model of fish migration. Finally, population dynamics and trophic relationships are considered using a MICE (Models of Intermediate Complexity) approach. SMART simulates the fishing effort reallocation resulting from the introduction of different management scenarios. Specifically, SMART was applied to evaluate the potential benefits of different management approaches of the trawl fisheries targeting demersal stocks (deepwater rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris, the giant red shrimp Aristaeomorpha foliacea, the European hake Merluccius merluccius, and the red mullet Mullus barbatus) in the Strait of Sicily. The simulated management scenarios included a reduction of both fishing capacity and effort, two different sets of temporal fishing closures, and two sets of spatial fishing closures, defined involving fishers. Results showed that both temporal and spatial closures are expected to determine a significant improvement in the exploitation pattern for all the species, ultimately leading to the substantial recovery of spawning stock biomass for the stocks. Overall, one of the management scenarios suggested by fishers scored better and confirms the usefulness of participatory approaches, suggesting the need for more public consultation when dealing with resource management at sea.",2019,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,6,,,WOS:000486544700001,10.3389/fmars.2019.00542,,#19589,Russo 2019,,
Safety Priorities and Underestimations in Recreational Scuba Diving Operations: A European Study Supporting the Implementation of New Risk Management Programmes,"Lucrezi, S; Egi, SM; Pieri, M; Burman, F; Ozyigit, T; Cialoni, D; Thomas, G; Marroni, A; Saayman, M","Introduction: Scuba diving is an important marine tourism sector, but requires proper safety standards to reduce the risks and increase accessibility to its market. To achieve safety goals, safety awareness and positive safety attitudes in recreational scuba diving operations are essential. However, there is no published research exclusively focusing on scuba divers' and dive centres' perceptions toward safety. This study assessed safety perceptions in recreational scuba diving operations, with the aim to inform and enhance safety and risk management programmes within the scuba diving tourism industry.Materials and Methods: Two structured questionnaire surveys were prepared by the organisation Divers Alert Network and administered online to scuba diving operators in Italy and scuba divers in Europe, using a mixture of convenience and snowball sampling. Questions in the survey included experience and safety offered at the dive centre; the buddy system; equipment and accessories for safe diving activities; safety issues in the certification of new scuba divers; incidents/accidents; and attitudes toward safety.Results: 91 scuba diving centres and 3,766 scuba divers participated in the study. Scuba divers gave importance to safety and the responsiveness of service providers, here represented by the dive centres. However, they underestimated the importance of a personal emergency action/assistance plan and, partly, of the buddy system alongside other safety procedures. Scuba divers agreed that some risks, such as those associated with running out of gas, deserve attention. Dive centres gave importance to aspects such as training and emergency action/assistance plans. However, they were limitedly involved in safety campaigning. Dive centres' perceptions of safety in part aligned with those of scuba divers, with some exceptions.Conclusion: Greater responsibility is required in raising awareness and educating scuba divers, through participation in prevention campaigns and training. The study supports the introduction of programmes aiming to create a culture of safety among dive centres and scuba divers. Two examples, which are described in this paper, include the Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment protocol for dive centres and scuba divers, and the Diving Safety Officer programme to create awareness, improve risk management, and mitigate health and safety risks.",2018,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,9,,,WOS:000428201600001,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00383,,#19591,Lucrezi 2018,,
A tale of two coasts: Networks of artisanal boat skippers in a fishing reserve in the Gulf of Cadiz and a recreational port in Islas Baleares,"Jariego, IM; del Corral, DF; Saez, J; Llompart, FS","The distribution of fishermen by fishing zones is an element of internal differentiation of fishing communities, observed both in fishing reserves and in less regulated fishing environments. Two case studies were carried out in a Fishing Reserve in Chipiona (Gulf of Cadiz) and in a non-Reserve location in Sant Antoni de Portmany (Balearic Islands), based on a survey and a qualitative discussion forum with the boats skippers in each port. In each case, the network of strong ties between the boats skippers were analysed and their attitudes towards changes experienced by the fishing sector were evaluated. In Chipiona 40 boats skippers were interviewed, of which 21 also participated in the subsequent qualitative forum. In Sant Antoni de Portmany 16 skippers were interviewed, of whom 10 participated in the qualitative forum. The results showed that the artisanal fishermen of both ports have similar properties in the structure of their social networks, which is organized in groups by fishing zones. However, they differ in their attitudes towards the transformation of the fishing sector with the incorporation of tourism, heritage and environmental uses. Both the engine power of the vessel and competition for fishery resources contribute to distinct fishing strategies, between the areas near the port and the alternative fishing grounds. These factors affect the structure of social relations in the fishing community, regardless of the regulation of fishing zones. Nonetheless, the fishing reserve seems to be an important contribution in modifying the structure of economic and social incentives, which consequently affects community readiness to adopt new environmental protection measures. This type of research helps to understand that, despite the differences observed between varying fishing communities, there are basic processes of competition and cooperation that condition the internal structure of fishing groups that share fishing grounds.",2018,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,161,,105-116,WOS:000437057200012,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.05.002,,#19593,Jariego 2018,,
Social Considerations of Large River Sanctuaries: A Case Study from the Hilsa Shad Fishery in Bangladesh,"Islam, MM; Aktar, R; Nahiduzzaman, M; Barman, BK; Wahab, MA","The establishment of a sanctuary is often suggested as an effective strategy for ecological restoration, though social aspects of such attempts are often overlooked. This study analyzed the socioeconomic status of 248 fishing households who are dependent on hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) sanctuaries in southern Bangladesh. Also, the fishers' perceptions were investigated to assess the status of ecological restoration, level of participation in the hilsa sanctuary management, their livelihoods constraints, and coping strategies during crises. Based on the fishers' perceptions and fishery catch data of the government, it appears that the establishment of the hilsa sanctuary in the Bangladesh waters helped to restore the hilsa fishery and also enhanced the fishers' income. However, a large section of hilsa fishers were found to be poor in terms of socioeconomic capital such as monthly income, housing conditions, and assets ownership. Particularly, these households suffer seasonal food insecurity during the banned period of fishing in the sanctuaries. The government's compensation scheme is a good example of payment of ecosystem services in an open water fishery; however, this scheme does not include all the affected fishers. Food and income insecurity during ban period often force fishers to use illegal fishing as a livelihood strategy that undermines the success of sanctuaries as an ecological restoration strategy. The findings reflected that sanctuaries and other similar management strategies have social impacts on stakeholders and human societies, and these social impacts can have surprising feedbacks that influence management success. Thus, the success of ecological restoration relies on understanding the human dimensions of the system and that ecological and social restoration must go together. To address this goal, we call for developing fisheries policy that will facilitate engagement of resource users and other local stakeholders in sanctuary comanagement, which will ultimately strengthen fishers' livelihoods and sustain the benefit from ecological restoration.",2018,,SUSTAINABILITY,10,4,,WOS:000435188000358,10.3390/su10041254,,#19594,Islam 2018,,
The Banco Chinchorro Biosphere reserve,"Gonzalez, BR; Luhrssemarnat, TC","Banco Chinchorro, located off the southern coast of Quintana Roo, Mexico, was declared as Biosphere reserve on 19 July 1996. This reserve (144, 360 ha) is classified by The National Biodiversity Commission as a Priority Region A-70, and the WWF considers it within the Global 200 priority areas. It is included in the 17 Marine Protected Areas in the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. Its great biodiversity, with endemic and threatened species,and its relative isolation makes Chinchorro a very important area for conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. Fishing, the main economic activity for the people from Xcalak, Mahahual and Chetumal, has grown since 1959, and is based on three fishermen cooperatives (92 members) focused on Queen conch (Strombus gigas) and lobster (Panulirus argus). As a part of a conservation strategy, the fast goal was to prepare the Management Plan involving two years of work with fishermen to achieve agreement. On the other hand, 73 administrative rules and 13 fines for eight kinds of users of the Reserve were approved by both federal and state government, as well as academic group and NGOs. Various actions have improved the conservation of Banco Chinchorro. Surveillance and enforcement programs, funded by both the federal government and WWF, attempt to reduce illegal fishing. A monitoring program funded by federal government and NGOs was created. Several research projects have been carried out with help of different academic institutions and the Mexican Navy, related with reef biodiversity, physical and chemical oceanography, bathymetry, and conch and lobster population studies.

"Factors influencing catch and support for the implementation of the closed fishing season in Davao Gulf, Philippines","Macusi, ED; Liguez, AKO; Macusi, ES; Digal, LN","The closed fishing season policy is annually imposed in Davao Gulf to allow the fish stocks to recover and address the declining fish catch. Up to now, there were no assessments conducted to determine multiple factors that could have been contributing to its proper implementation in the Davao Gulf. A mixed-methods approach was used through interviews of fishers (N = 229) and supplemented by nine focus groups in Governor Genemso, Lupon, Davao City, Sta. Maria, Don Marcelino and Malita. Results of the regression analysis showed that the catch per unit effort (CPUE) was highly influenced by revenue and number of years of fishing experience (df = 3, MS = 7.38, F = 47.90, p < .001). In addition, the main predictors for the support of the imposition of closed fishing season were the number of fishing hours, fish price, membership to community organizations, and awareness of policy among fishers. Economic motivation seems to predominate among fishers as both factors: revenue and fish price, are related and increase due to the imposition of the closed fishing season. The fishing experience and the number of hours of fishing can both determine the catch success of fishers in their fishing grounds. In addition, the flow of information between fishers is usually done through membership with community organizations due to the familiarity of members with one another. Moreover, fisher to fisher interactions also help transmit information in the fishing grounds. Ultimately, the fisher's willingness to cooperate and support the closed fishing season policy will help determine the fish stocks recovery.",2021,,MARINE POLICY,130,,,WOS:000670179100009,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104578,,#19598,Macusi 2021,,
A framework of lessons learned from community-based marine reserves and its effectiveness in guiding a new coastal management initiative in the Philippines,"Beger, M; Harborne, AR; Dacles, TP; Solandt, JL; Ledesma, GL","Community-based coastal resource management has been widely applied within the Philippines. However, small-scale community-based reserves are often inefficient owing to management inadequacies arising because of a lack of local support or enforcement or poor design. Because there are many potential pitfalls during the establishment of even small community-based reserves, it is important for coastal managers, communities, and facilitating institutions to have access to a summary of the key factors for success. Reviewing relevant literature, we present a framework of ""lessons learned"" during the establishment of protected areas, mainly in the Philippines. The framework contains summary guidance on the importance of ( 1) an island location, ( 2) small community population size, ( 3) minimal effect of land-based development, ( 4) application of a bottom-up approach, ( 5) an external facilitating institution, ( 6) acquisition of title, ( 7) use of a scientific information database, ( 8) stakeholder involvement, ( 9) the establishment of legislation, ( 10) community empowerment, ( 11) alternative livelihood schemes, ( 12) surveillance, ( 13) tangible management results, ( 14) continued involvement of external groups after reserve establishment, and ( 15) small-scale project expansion.These framework components guided the establishment of a community-based protected area at Danjugan Island, Negros Occidental, Philippines. This case study showed that the framework was a useful guide that led to establishing and implementing a community- based marine reserve. Evaluation of the reserve using standard criteria developed for the Philippines shows that the Danjugan Island protected area can be considered successful and sustainable. At Danjugan Island, all of the lessons synthesized in the framework were important and should be considered elsewhere, even for relatively small projects. As shown in previous projects in the Philippines, local involvement and stewardship of the protected area appeared particularly important for its successful implementation. The involvement of external organizations also seemed to have a key role in the success of the Danjugan Island project by guiding local decision-makers in the sociobiological principles of establishing protected areas. However, the relative importance of each component of the framework will vary between coastal management initiatives both within the Philippines and across the wider Asian region.",2004,,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,34,6,786-801,WOS:000227236800003,10.1007/s00267-004-0149-z,,#19599,Beger 2004,,
"THE OMANI ABALONE HALIOTIS MARIAE (WOOD, 1828) FISHERY: CHALLENGES OVER THREE DECADES","Al Jufaili, SM; Al Rashdi, K; Elegbede, IO","The Omani abalone Haliotis mariae (Wood. 1828) supports one of the most valuable fisheries in Oman. It is specific to defined areas along the northern region of Dhofar in Oman. This study reviews the management of the Omani abalone fishery during the last 31 y, identifies the challenges encountered, and suggests solutions to overcome these difficulties. During the period 1988-2018. annual abalone landings ranged from 29 tonnes (mt) in 1999 to 149 mt in 2011, with an average of 53 mt. In 2019, landings 24 t (53 t whole weight) were reported to be the lowest in the last three decades and landed within 10 days of opening. The fishery generated 1.3 million Omani rials (3.38 million US$) (OR, where 1 OR = 2.6 USD) in 1993 and 8.2 million OR in 2011. with an average of 2.5 million OR (6.5 million IJSS). By contrast, the average annual price per kg was 50 OR (130 US$). The fishery was mainly managed in accordance with seasonal closures, which ranged from 6 mo to less than 1 mo; in one case, there was a complete suspension of fishing for 3 y. The number of fishers engaged in this fishery was not stable, and fluctuated between 1,450 in 1993 and 8,539 in 2014. The seasonal closures between 1988 and 2003 resulted in a gradual decrease in average landings, reaching 2%-45% at the end of the season, with an average of 27%. The percentage of divers who participated at the end of the season ranged from 9% to 90%, with an average of 47%. It is suggested that the government should conduct comprehensive research to assess the Omani abalone stock, population dynamics, and habitat, as well as the behavior of the fishermen. Furthermore, better data collection and monitoring systems should be established. It is strongly recommended that a ""pulse fishing"" or spatial-based or temporary marine-protected area fishing (zonation) approach that serves the objectives of stock and habitat preservation be implemented. Thus, the restoration of the Omani abalone fishery is achievable but will require long-term research efforts.",2020,,JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH,39,3,683-693,WOS:000606573000014,10.2983/035.039.0314,,#19600,AlJufaili 2020,,
Seeking Spirituality: Respecting the Social Value of Coastal Recreational Resources in England and Wales,"Pike, K; Johnson, D; Fletcher, S; Wright, P","Social value is understood by individuals but is itself a contested concept, although community and participation are key associated terms. Arguably social value of protected areas can be viewed as primarily recreational and aesthetic. Perhaps as a result, social value is often much less considered when compared to environmental and economic aspects when planning the establishment and management of protected areas in coastal locations. Understanding how society values these areas could therefore make a significant difference to optimising management direction and outcomes. Furthermore, understanding non-monetary values could help evaluate trade-offs which can be made between scenarios such as alternative development, management and conservation.Literature on social value touches on many topics including the emotional appreciation of wilderness and theory of visitor management. Ironically, in the future, climate change may raise social value at the coast given a public fascination with dramatic storms and sensational rapid change as a result of coastal processes. In order to identify social value, evaluate how it has been applied, and suggest better future integration, research focussing on selected coastal protected areas in England and Wales has taken an inductive grounded theory approach. A combination of practitioner and public interviews were undertaken to inform the design of a normative statement and model of social value. To understand social values at an operational level a detailed 'zoning chart' exercise in conjunction with an expert scoring system was applied to four case studiesThis work has resulted in validating social value criteria and has highlighted the complexities of measuring social value, particularly using a scoring system to rate the criteria. Tranquillity, for example, is typically subjective. Zoning charts proved to be a productive data collection tool, allowing visualisation of the criteria. All the data collection phases demonstrated that criteria in the 'spirituality and natural environment' theme provided the most social value to the public. Criteria in this theme include areas where it is possible to get away from other people in order to experience tranquillity, isolation and remoteness: experiences of views and open coastline: inspirational opportunities for art, poetry and photography: and an outdoor experience in a place where people want to be.",2011,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,,,194-204,WOS:000306715200026,,,#19602,Pike 2011,,
International megabenthic long-term monitoring of a changing arctic ecosystem: Baseline results,"Jorgensen, LL; Logerwell, EA; Strelkova, N; Zakharov, D; Roy, V; Nozeres, C; Bluhm, BA; Olafsdottir, SH; Burgos, JM; Sorensen, J; Zimina, O; Rand, K","The sustainable development and environmental protection of the Arctic ecosystem is on the agenda globally. The Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals call for conserving at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas globally. Management tools to achieve this goal include marine protected areas (MPAs) and ""other effective area-based conservation measures"" (OECMs) of structural megabenthic organisms (e.g. corals, sea pens, sponges, anemones, etc.). But large areas of the ocean are lacking information about seabed communities. Here we show that this data gap can potentially be filled by collecting data on megabenthic organisms that are ""bycatch"" (not the target species) on government research vessels monitoring commercial fish and shellfish. For this paper, several Arctic and sub-arctic nations contributed megabenthos data from a total of 12.569 fish assessment trawls and associated bottom water temperature data. The latter outline areas of warm sub-Arctic inflow versus colder Arctic waters, which we align with temperature affinities of community. We also found that maximum levels of shared taxa were higher between Atlantic and Eurasian Arctic Seas than with Pacific Arctic Seas. Areas of high standardized species richness generally, but not everywhere, coincided with areas of high standardized biomass and/or high current velocity and in transition zones between water masses. We did not find that standardized taxon richness declined with latitude (from 60 to 81 degrees N) as has been previously hypothesized. High biomass was generally associated with Arctic outflow shelves and/ or (within-region) colder water masses. We identify areas with high proportions of sessile and upright taxa that may be susceptible to damage by bottom trawl gear, taxa with calcareous skeletons that may be susceptible to ocean acidification, and 'cold-water' taxa that may be most vulnerable to ocean warming.

The psychological impacts of community-based protected areas,"Yasue, M; Kockel, A; Dearden, P","This cross-sectional and mixed-methods study uses Self-Determination Theory and the Theory of Basic Human Values to investigate changes in motivations, attitudes, beliefs and values following the establishment of community-based marine protected areas (MPAs). Open-ended and retrospective questions, as well as survey instruments, were used in six communities with different-aged (new: 1-3 years old, medium-aged: 5-11 years old and old: 20-25 years old) MPAs in the Philippines. Respondents included both community members either involved (n = 101) or not involved (n = 108) in MPA management. Respondents reported increased appreciation for the benefits of MPAs and more positive attitudes about MPAs over time. In comparison to respondents from communities with new MPAs, respondents in communities with medium-aged and old MPAs identified a wider range of MPA impacts on themselves (e.g. new friendships, learning and greater pro-environmental values), their community (e.g. increased fish catch, social capital), and on ecosystems (e.g. different species and ecosystems-types). Similarly, respondents from medium-aged and old MPAs had fewer non-autonomous motivations (i.e. motivations arising externally, such as social status or pay) to engage in MPA management and also had higher self-transcendence values, such as caring for nature. These results suggest that community-based MPAs may encourage psychological shifts in communities such as greater autonomous motivation to care for nature and enhanced self-transcendence values, both of which may support conservation. By developing a more holistic approach to assessing the multi-faceted impacts of community-based conservation, this type of psychological research helps to identify and prioritize timely actions in the establishment and maintenance of resilient and sustainable community-based MPAs.",,,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,,,,WOS:000769979800001,10.1002/aqc.3801,,#19604,,,
"The development and unraveling of marine resource co-management in the Pemba Channel, Zanzibar: institutions, governance, and the politics of scale","Levine, A","Marine resource management programs face conflicting mandates: to scale-up marine conservation efforts to cover larger areas and meet national and international conservation targets, while simultaneously to downscale and decentralize management authority to resource users and local communities. These conflicting goals create tensions in marine resource management. This paper explores these tensions by presenting and evaluating the outcomes of a fisheries co-management program on the island of Pemba, Tanzania, where institutions and scale were configured and reconfigured under externally funded programs to improve marine conservation through co-management. The initial institutional arrangements for co-management supported a functioning system to protect marine resources, ensure fishermen's access, and distribute tourism revenues. However, a subsequent push to scale-up marine management reconfigured institutional arrangements and power in a more hierarchical and potentially weaker system. With the expansion of the co-management program, protected area coverage, financial resources, and the number of community organizations created for fisheries co-management expanded tremendously; however, community participation in marine management decreased, and the fishermen's association previously involved in co-management dissolved. Several factors contributed to this outcome: inadequate time to solidify co-management institutions and arrangements, diverse resource users inexperienced with local management, a sudden and substantial new source of funding, and political pressures to restructure marine management. Rather than focusing primarily on expanding coverage and devolving authority, it is important to adapt co-management arrangements to the local contexts in which they operate.",2016,,REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE,16,5,1279-1291,WOS:000376314400005,10.1007/s10113-015-0856-4,,#19605,Levine 2016,,
Conservation of marine and coastal biodiversity in Brazil,"Amaral, ACZ; Jablonski, S","The invertebrate benthos, especially the micro- and mesofaunal components, of the Brazilian seas is still poorly known. Relatively few species have been recorded, reflecting the lack of research in this field. The intertidal zone, to depths of about 20 in, has been studied the most, and there the numbers of endemic species are relatively high. The diversity of demersal and pelagic fishes is similar among the major marine regions, and endemism is typically low (<5%) and restricted to reef species. Surveys in southeastern Brazil (depths of up to 2000 in) have recorded more than 1300 species of benthic animals, of which the Porifera, Cnidaria, Sipuncula, Gastropoda, Bivalvia, Scaphopoda, Polychaeta, Crustacea, Ophiuroidea, Bryozoa, and Brachiopoda were the most abundant or frequent Excepting the molluscs, decapods (brachiurans), cirripeds, and echinoderms, the faunas of salt marshes, coral reefs, and islands remain poorly known. Marine and estuarine demersal teleosts include 617 species in 26 orders and 118 families. Just over half the species (337) are Perciformes. Overexploitation, for food and by the aquarium fish trade, habitat degradation and destruction, alien species introductions, pernicious tourism, and pollution are the principal threats to Brazil's marine biodiversity. The Minister of the Environment lists 34 threatened and 10 overexploited or at risk of being overexploited benthic species. Fishes officially listed as threatened include 15 species of sharks and rays and 7 teleosts. Another six elasmobranchs and 27 teleosts are currently or potentially being overexploited. Conservation of marine biodiversity in Brazil is still broadly inadequate despite existing legislation and several protected areas. The number and size of marine protected areas are insufficient, and some still lack management plans or have yet to receive the appropriate measures and infrastructure to make them effective. Fisheries administration and management is still precarious and in many areas lacks effective participation of local communities. Major conservation initiatives include the identification of keys areas for biodiversity conservation, surveys, intensified monitoring of fisheries, environmental education, and the creation and improved management of protected areas.",2005,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,19,3,625-631,WOS:000229448100008,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00692.x,,#19609,Amaral 2005,,
Protecting marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction: A penguins' perspective,"Thiebot, JB; Dreyfus, M","The expansion of human activities in offshore maritime regions has outpaced the development of scientific knowledge and cooperative governance across these areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ). In this context, current negotiations by the United Nations aim for an international legally-binding instrument to improve governance and sustainable use of biodiversity in ABNJ. Penguins are among the most threatened seabird groups today, notably at sea from fisheries and oiling. Here, we examine the available information on penguins' movements and evaluate their use of ABNJ across species and life-cycle stages. We highlight that in most of the 18 extant penguin species, the birds may undertake spectacular migrations, seasonally or throughout life-cycle stages. Long-range movements were reported in 16 species, with trans-jurisdictional distribution in 14 species, including 13 in ABNJ. Species richness in ABNJ varied extensively according to oceanic region, and also varied according to season. Transboundary movements, notably to ABNJ, are thus remarkably prevalent among penguin species. Consequently, provisions of the treaty under negotiation may crucially benefit penguin conservation, notably by creating a uniform legal framework to designate protected areas in ABNJ, and by promoting the precautionary approach to extraction activities. However, the seasonally-dynamic utilisation of ABNJ by penguins supports the pertinence of adding innovative protection tools, such as mobile Marine Protected Areas, to the negotiations for a more adequate protection of marine biodiversity. Underlining penguins' remarkable connectivity to the high seas can thus further strengthen this instrument aiming to protect a global ocean commons heritage of mankind.",2021,,MARINE POLICY,131,,,WOS:000682946000006,10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104640,,#19610,Thiebot 2021,,
Balancing sustainability in two pioneering marine national parks in Scandinavia,"Morf, A; Sandstrom, A; Jagers, SC","Even though marine protected areas (MPAs) have become central instruments in the endeavour towards sustainable development, our knowledge on how different institutional designs influence outcomes is limited. Using a comparative case study design, this paper explores the interplay between institutional arrangements and management outcomes in two adjacent yet institutionally slightly differing MPAs, encompassing a shared marine trench and a partially inhabited archipelago landscape namely the Koster Sea National Park in Sweden and the Outer Hvaler National Park in Norway. How can differences in the institutional designs governing the two parks, be linked to differences in sustainability outcomes? What lessons can be learnt for the design of MPAs? The study shows that institutional design influences management outcomes in some respects but not in others. Differences in overall management systems had no noticeable effects on sustainability outcomes and how they were perceived, while the differing objectives of the parks and how they are made operational seem to have affected the outcomes. But they have also influenced actors' expectations and their assessment of outcomes. According to this study, conservation arrangements can be broadened beyond mere nature protection. However, the study also underlines the challenges of locally adapted and participatory institutional designs and emphasises the importance of taking users' varying expectations related to social and economic values into account throughout the whole process. The establishment of national parks is no guarantee for broader sustainable development per se; this also requires resources and proper embedding and integration with relevant sectors and tiers in the overall management system.

Effectiveness of short-term knowledge communication on Baltic Sea marine genetic biodiversity to public managers,"Lundmark, C; Andersson, K; Sandstrom, A; Laikre, L","The aim of this study is to assess the impact of two forms of short-term knowledge communication-lectures and group deliberations-on public managers' policy beliefs regarding genetic biodiversity in the Baltic Sea. Genetic biodiversity is a key component of biological variation, but despite scientific knowledge and far-reaching political goals, genetic biodiversity remains neglected in marine management. Previous research highlights lack of knowledge among managers as one explanation to the implementation deficit. This multidisciplinary study builds on the identified need for an improved knowledge transfer between science and ongoing management. A basic knowledge package on genetic biodiversity in the Baltic Sea was presented as either a lecture or a deliberative group discussion to two separate samples of public managers who are involved in Baltic Sea and other biodiversity management at the regional level in Sweden. The empirical findings show that the communicated information has an impact on the public managers' beliefs on genetic biodiversity of the Baltic Sea. Lectures seem more efficient to transfer knowledge on this theme. Those who received information through a lecture strengthen their confidence in area protection as a management tool to conserve genetic diversity. They were also more convinced of the obligation of authorities at national and regional level to take on larger responsibility for genetic conservation than those managers who participated in a deliberative discussion.",2017,,REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE,17,3,841-849,WOS:000394991000018,10.1007/s10113-016-1077-1,,#19612,Lundmark 2017,,
"Governance of the Cassurubd Extractive Reserve, Bahia State, Brazil: An analysis of strengths and weaknesses to inform policy","Nobre, DM; Alarcon, DT; Cinti, A; Schiavetti, A","This study analyzed the governance of the Cassuruba Extractive Reserve or RESEX in Bahia State, Brazil, exploring the favorable conditions and the difficulties faced by this newly established and complex governance system. RESEXS are protected areas that involve traditional communities in its administration through majority representation in a Deliberative Council (DC). Research was conducted through literature and documents review, participant observation through direct involvement in community activities along several years (20082016), and semi-structured and structured interviews applied respectively to members of the DC and to users of the RESEX during 2012 and 2013. The Institutional Design Principles were used as an analytical tool to reflect on the strengths, limitations, and the multiple factors affecting its governance. Interview results suggest a more negative perception of resource users about RESEX functioning and prospects than DC members. Participation of resource users in RESEX meetings was low and a passive performance of council members was observed. Since 2012-2013, participation of users and council members has been gradually increasing. Several of the design principles were found to be present (boundaries, congruence, collective arrangements though enhanced participation is needed, conflict resolution mechanisms, recognition of rights to organize, nested enterprises), and only two were deemed insufficient or mostly absent: monitoring (4A and 4B), but improving in terms of community participation in vigilance, and graduated sanctions (5), present in legislation but hardly implemented. Further studies should be pursued for continuing adding blocks to the understanding of CPR governance systems with diverse degrees of complexity.",2017,,MARINE POLICY,77,,44-55,WOS:000394557400007,10.1016/j.marpol.2016.12.008,,#19613,Nobre 2017,,
"Conceptualization and implementation of a multi-agent model to simulate whale-watching tours in the St. Lawrence Estuary in Quebec, Canada","Anwar, SM; Jeanneret, CA; Parrott, L; Marceau, DJ","The Saguenay St. Lawrence Marine Park (SSLMP) and the adjacent Marine Protected Area (MPA) in the St. Lawrence Estuary, in Quebec, cover a territory of exceptional biodiversity including 12 species of marine mammals, nearly half of which are considered to be endangered species. Whale-watching trips and other human activities related to commercial shipping, tourism, and recreation generate very intensive traffic in the area. which pose cumulative threats to the marine wildlife. This study has been undertaken in collaboration with the Marine Park and the MPA managers to develop a multi-agent system (MAS) to investigate the interactions between the traffic and the marine mammals in the estuary. This paper describes the first prototype version of the proposed MAS model where the focus is on the whale-watching boats. It discusses the conceptual model with its principal components: the physical environment and the boat agents and whale entities, and the implementation of the model with the behavior rules of the agents. In this version of the MAS, the whale-watching boats are represented as cognitive agents while the whales are simple reactive entities. The prototype model was implemented in the agent-based modeling platform RePast. An index, the happiness factor (i.e., the ratio of whale observation time over the trip duration) was designed to measure how successful the boat agents are in achieving their goal. Simulations were run to assess different decision strategies of the boat agents and their impacts on the whales. Results show that cooperative behavior that involves a combination of innovator and imitator strategies yields a higher average happiness factor over non-cooperative, purely innovators, behavior. However, this cooperative behavior creates increased risk for the whale populations in the estuary. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of participation in and management of the Transkei shore linefishery,"Mann, BQ; McDonald, AM; Sauer, WHH; Hecht, T","Both roving creel and aerial surveys were used to quantify fishing effort along the former Transkei coast. A stratified random sampling procedure was used during shore patrols to assess catch and effort, and a questionnaire survey provided information on total fishing effort, fisher demographics and attitudes towards current regulations. A total of 13 field trips was undertaken, during which 341 fishers were interviewed and the catches of 760 fishers examined. In all, 175 patrols were undertaken, covering in all 1117 km. Some 24 random aerial counts of shore-fishers were also carried out during the study. From the aerial surveys, average fisher density along the Transkei coast was estimated at 0.79 fishers km(-1), with an estimated total fishing effort of 170457 fisher-days year(-1). Fisher densities were highest in spring (0.9 fishers km(-1)) and lowest during summer (0.5 fishers km(-1)). Fishers were most successful in winter (1.0 fish fisher(-1) inspection(-1)) and least successful in summer (0.4 fish fisher(-1) inspection(-1)). Catch rates amounted to 1.4 fish fisher(-1) day(-1), or 0.86 kg fisher(-1) day(-1), and the total catch was estimated at 147 tons year(-1). The main target species were bronze bream Pachymetopon grande (22%), blacktail Diplodus sargus capensis (19%) and dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus (18%). Numerically, the most important species in the catches were elf Pomatomus saltatrix (18%) and blacktail (16%). By mass, the most important species were bronze bream (26%) and dusky kob (18%). Knowledge and compliance of regulations currently governing the linefishery in the Transkei was exceptionally poor, although most fishers supported the principle of regulations.

Climate adaptation in South America with emphasis in coastal areas: the state-of-the-art and case studies from Venezuela and Uruguay,"Villamizar, A; Gutierrez, ME; Nagy, GJ; Caffera, RM; Leal, W","The South American (SA) region is particularly vulnerable to climate change and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events which threaten its economy and sustainable development. Therefore, climate adaptation is a regional priority. At least 6% of SA population live at low-elevation coastal zones (LECZ) exposed to sea-level rise, ENSO variability and storminess. This paper reviews some recent and current adaptation experiences in SA coasts focusing on (i) socioeconomic and vulnerability status, (ii) links between adaptation and sustainable development, and (iii) constraints to adaptation. Despite the regional economic growth and poverty reduction over the last decade, an adaptation deficit to current climate variability persists. Overall, SA countries show a poor link between public policies, adaptation, and theoretical-academic scope. Public adaptation efforts in coastal areas are mostly oriented towards risk assessment, vulnerability and reduction of impacts at urban and touristic settlements. Many experiences developed from the academy follow the community-based adaptation (CBA) approach mainstreamed into local plans. Adaptation constraints are linked with poverty, social priorities, allocation of resources and the multifaceted impacts of climate change. Two coastal CBA case studies in Venezuela and Uruguay based on scientific and local knowledge show that non-structural adaptation measures can improve the populations' perception of risks, provided that stakeholders, mainly the community, are informed and integrated to define adaptation actions. There are lots of plans and less specific actions. We propose that the assessment of adaptation success has to rely on implementation and effectiveness criteria rather than solely on plans.",2017,,CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT,9,4,364-382,WOS:000400799100007,10.1080/17565529.2016.1146120,,#19617,Villamizar 2017,,
Delineating priority areas for marine biodiversity conservation in the Coral Triangle,"Asaad, I; Lundquist, CJ; Erdmann, MV; Costello, MJ","Identifying priority areas for biodiversity conservation requires systematic approaches and integrated ecological and biological information. Here, we applied a range of ecological criteria to assess areas of biodiversity importance in the Coral Triangle region, a priority region for marine biodiversity conservation because of its high species richness and endemicity. We used distribution data of three biogenic habitats to assess the criterion of sensitive habitat, modeled geographic distributions of 10,672 species ranges and occurrence records of 19,251 species to evaluate the criterion of species richness, distributions of 834 species of special conservation concern to examine the criterion of species of conservation concern, distributions of 373 reef fish species to assess the criterion of restricted-range species, and distribution of nesting sites and migratory route of six species of sea turtle to evaluate the criterion of areas of importance for particular life history stages. We identified areas of biodiversity importance by superimposing each of the different criterion. We performed two tiers of multi criteria analysis: (1) a Coral Triangle regional level analysis to identify ""clustered hotspots"" (i.e., groups of cells) of biodiversity significance, and (2) a site-based analysis to identify the specific sites (cells) of greatest biodiversity importance. We found that approximately 13% of the Coral Triangle was clustered into hotspots of high biodiversity importance. These areas occurred along the southern part of the Philippines, the north-eastern part of Malaysian Sabah, central to eastern reaches of Indonesia, the eastern part of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. By comparison, the site-based analysis identified seven sites of highest biodiversity importance in the Coral Triangle include: (1) the northern tip of Sulawesi Island, (2) Ambon Island, (3) Kei Islands, (4) Raja Ampat Archipelago of Indonesian Papua, (5) the Verde Island Passage, (6) the southern part of Negros Island, and (7) Cebu Island.

Assessing Procedural Justice in the Administration of Small-Scale Benthic Fisheries in Chile,"Estevez, RA; Jerez, G; Gelcich, S","In order to navigate toward ocean sustainability, policies, programs, and scientific research must address issues of justice. In fisheries management, justice has generally been understood in terms of the distribution of social, cultural, and economic benefits. However, there are also important procedural justice challenges in the fisheries system, which are fundamental to the long-term sustainability and equity of the oceans. Procedural justice is related to the conditions under which the negotiation for benefit distribution takes place. That is, the procedures, structures, and processes that lead to the distribution of resources. In this study, we empirically assess fishers' perceptions of procedural justice components within a small-scale fishery management policy in Chile which has been shifting toward a polycentric type of governance during the past 7 years. We specifically assess perceptions of management committee members. Management committees have been constituted as spaces of collective action for participatory decision-making. We decompose procedural justice in seven subcomponents and assess perceptions associated to achievement in the administration of fisheries. Our results show that management committee members perceive heterogeneity in the achievement of different procedural justice components, which is a central element in achieving equitable development in the oceans. The highest perceptions of achievement were found in the procedures for the selection of participants, the use of various types of technical and local knowledge for decision-making, and the perception by participants of ethical and impartial procedures. We also identified significant challenges related to an inflexible legal structure that hinders adaptive management and learning as a tool for institutional transformation. In addition, mechanisms for communicating decisions to users and clear accountability procedures were perceived as weak. It is critical to address these gaps as they can jeopardize the implementation and legitimacy of fisheries management. Focusing on different components of procedural justice can provide an important lens through which advances and gaps in fisheries policy can be identified and worked upon.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000692774100001,10.3389/fmars.2021.636120,,#19619,Estevez 2021,,

The mutton snapper aggregation was located in coral patches, while the spawning aggregation of grey triggerfish was located on the windward terrace of the reef flat. Fishery data was obtained for the duration of the spawning event in 2008, with a total of 5 days for mutton snapper and 4 days for grey triggerfish. The fishery recorded a total of 830 mutton snappers, with individual sizes ranging from 40 to 77 cm in fork length (FL). Individual size and catch per unit effort (CPUE) decreased through time, with the lowest values presented at the end of the 5 days. In contrast, a total of 665 grey triggerfish were recorded in the catch, ranging from 45 to 61 cm (FL) with the largest sizes caught at the end of the fishing period, concurrently with the lowest CPUE. A lack of governance allowed both species to be harvested during their spawning aggregations.

Assessment of recreational fishery in the Galapagos Marine Reserve: Failures and opportunities,"Schuhbauer, A; Koch, V","The Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) is one of largest marine protected areas in the world. After its establishment in 1998 fishing rights in the GMR were given exclusively to local fishers and only small-scale fishing is permitted. As tourism is exponentially increasing in Galapagos and the two most important fisheries resources have almost collapsed, fishers are seeking alternatives in the more profitable tourism sector. A recreational fishery called ""Pesca Artesanal Vivencial"" (PAV) was established in 2005, where tourists are taken out by local fishers on their boats to experience an authentic day at sea. Our research focused on the problems which occurred during the implementation of PAV and the suggestions of possible solutions for a future sustainable management. To assess the current situation of PAV in Galapagos information was gathered from captain's logbooks, port authorities, questionnaires, interviews and participatory workshops. Results show that the implementation of PAV has not been successful. Instead, regular catch and release sport fishing is becoming increasingly prevalent in the Galapagos Islands, organized by tourism agencies, without benefiting the local fishing sector. Stakeholders have very divergent interests, impeding the development of a sustainable management of PAV. Regulations need to be stricter with improved enforcement so that fishers are not only figureheads, but are the real owners who run the business. To allow PAV to develop into a sustainable income alternative for the local fishing sector in Galapagos, a long-term management plan needs to be established, taking into account the current problems described in this analysis.

"Quantifying local coastal stewardship reveals motivations, models and engagement strategies","Turnbull, JW; Johnston, EL; Kajlich, L; Clark, GF","The human footprint on earth is now so great that we must become environmental stewards. To encourage stewardship and achieve better conservation outcomes, research is needed to connect practice with sound theory, and to empirically measure stewardship so we can identify its predictors and motivators.In this study, we use mixed methods to develop a new quantitative indicator for local environmental stewardship in a coastal context. We interviewed 111 people in eastern Australia about their knowledge and use of the coast and extracted information on seven generalised stewardship actions. We combined these into a single indicator which allowed us to evaluate and compare stewardship levels between participants and develop quantitative models. We found that stewardship was predicted by four traits: attraction to marine wildlife, self-identifying as local, size of local social network, and norms regarding informal enforcement. High-stewardship individuals exhibited eco-centric and anthropocentric worldviews and were motivated by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We combined these with stewardship actions in a refined model which highlights the importance of people, policy and place in environmental stewardship.We believe this is the first study to quantify stewardship behaviour and its motivating factors in a broad social-ecological context spanning both terrestrial and marine realms. Our research allows stewardship to be measured, modelled and analysed via a transferable indicator. This enables a deeper understanding of local environmental stewardship and the factors that predict and motivate it and allows us to propose practical strategies to engage people to improve stewardship and conservation outcomes.",2020,,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,249,,,WOS:000567872700008,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108714,,#19626,Turnbull 2020,,
Terms of reference towards coastal management and sustainable development in Latin America: introduction to Special Issue on progress and experiences,"Yanez-Arancibia, A","This paper is the introduction to a Special Issue Progress on Ocean and Coastal Management in Latin America: Experiences Towards Sustainable Development. This volume presents a variety of perspectives on the meaning, forms, methods, international cooperation, and experiences in integrated coastal management in 14 countries through 13 papers authored by experts in Latin American experiences. At present, the new international forums and the economic and environmental globalization induce different strategies for evaluating the real problems and advance towards planning the integrated coastal management, both from a national or regional perspective. At the opening of the new millenium Latin America has new scenarios under NAFTA, MERCOSUR, APEC, CARICOM, moreover a number of bi- or trilateral international agreements. The purpose of this Special Issue is to expose various definitions and points of view on integrated coastal management, providing an up-to-date assessment of key issues and country experiences, but not necessarily to resolving or reconciling divergent perspectives. Latin America is a ""new world mosaic"". A mosaic of authors' training and experiences; of roots and cultural/heritage resources; of social development; of ecosystems and ecological approaches; of biogeographical regions and biodiversity; of climatic zones; of pristine areas as well as highly degraded zones. This Special Issue has four key word/concepts in its title: (a) coastal zone; (b) integrated coastal zone management; (c) sustainable development, and (d) Latin America. In this introductory paper I offer what are the terms of reference meaning of each of this concern, as a framework for the invited papers/countries included in this volume. In the last section each contribution is summarized and a classification inside ""coastal management techniques"" is presented, concluding that the papers incise on: Coastal management plans, Land-use zoning and setbacks, Marine protected areas, Management and restoration of coastal habitats, Coastal pollution control, Shoreline stabilization, Close access regimes, Capacity building, inter-agency coordination, Conflict resolutions, Environmental assessment, and international cooperation. The variations in scope and the amount of progress made by different Latin American countries show the difficulty of creating a single integrating management approach. Nevertheless, at the opening of the new millenium Latin America will arrive at a competitive maturity stage concerning ICZM.

They are largely in poor environmental condition with deteriorating trends. Despite several success stories, European policies for marine conservation fall short of being effective. Acknowledging the challenges for marine conservation, a 4-year multi-national network, MarCons, supported collaborative marine conservation efforts to bridge the gap between science, management and policy, aiming to contribute in reversing present negative trends. By consolidating a large network of more than 100 scientists from 26 countries, and conducting a series of workshops over 4 years (2016-2020), MarCons analyzed challenges, opportunities and obstacles for advancing marine conservation in the European and contiguous seas. Here, we synthesize the major issues that emerged from this analysis and make 12 key recommendations for policy makers, marine managers, and researchers. To increase the effectiveness of marine conservation planning, we recommend (1) designing coherent networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the framework of marine spatial planning (MSP) and applying systematic conservation planning principles, including re-evaluation of existing management zones, (2) designing MPA networks within a broader transboundary planning framework, and (3) implementing integrated land-freshwater-sea approaches. To address inadequate or poorly informed management, we recommend (4) developing and implementing adaptive management plans in all sites of the Natura 2000 European conservation network and revising the Natura 2000 framework, (5) embedding and implementing cumulative effects assessments into a risk management process and making them operational, and (6) promoting actions to reach 'good environmental status' in all European waters. To account for global change in conservation planning and management, we further recommend (7) developing conservation strategies to address the impacts of global change, for example identifying climate-change refugia as high priority conservation areas, and (8) incorporating biological invasions in conservation plans and prioritizing management actions to control invasive species. Finally, to improve current practices that may compromise the effectiveness of conservation actions, we recommend (9) reinforcing the collection of high-quality open-access data, (10) improving mechanisms for public participation in MPA planning and management, (11) prioritizing conservation goals in full collaboration with stakeholders, and (12) addressing gender inequality in marine sciences and conservation.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,7,,,WOS:000581132900001,10.3389/fmars.2020.565968,,#19629,Katsanevakis 2020,,
Detection of gaps in the spatial coverage of coral reef monitoring projects in the US Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico,"Asch, RG; Turgeon, DD","As part of the US Coral Reef Task Force's National Program to Map, Assess, Inventory, and Monitor US Coral Reef Ecosystems, a comprehensive survey of projects/programs monitoring coral reef ecosystems and related habitats (i.e., seagrass beds and mangroves) in the US Caribbean and Pacific was undertaken. Information was gathered on a total of 296 monitoring and assessment projects conducted since 1990 in the US Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. Substantial gaps in monitoring coverage of US coral reef ecosystems were revealed through geographic information system (GIS) analysis of survey metadata. Although southern Florida contains approximately two-thirds of all marine monitoring projects found in the US Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, we were unable to identify any ongoing projects that monitor coral reefs along Florida's western coast and off of the Florida Middle Grounds. Additionally, Florida is covered by approximately 1 900 km(2) of mangroves, yet there were only four ongoing projects that monitor this ecosystem, leaving gaps in coverage in the Lower and Middle Keys and along the eastern and western coasts. The Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, located offshore of the Texas/Louisiana border, has an integral long-term monitoring program, but lacks a monitoring project that gathers long-term, quantitative data on reef fish abundance and certain water quality parameters. Numerous coral reef monitoring projects in Puerto Rico arc concentrated on the island's southwestern coast surrounding La Parguera, while far fewer monitoring projects are conducted along the northern and southeastern coasts and around Vieques Island. In the US Virgin Islands, the paucity of monitoring projects in large areas of St. Croix and St. Thomas contrasts with monitoring activity in three marine protected areas (MPAs), where 66% of the US Virgin Islands' coral reef monitoring sites were found. Only a series of assessments have been conducted at Navassa, a small, uninhabited island located 55 km west of Haiti and 137 km northeast of Jamaica. In order to better understand changes in coral reef communities and to produce a series of biennial reports on the status of US coral reef ecosystems, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is developing a national coral reef monitoring network. This network has already begun to fill some of these gaps in monitoring coverage through issuing cooperative grants to states and territories to build long-term monitoring capacity.",2003,,REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,51,,127-140,WOS:000185198100016,,,#19634,Asch 2003,,
Organizing phenological data resources to inform natural resource conservation,"Rosemartin, AH; Crimmins, TM; Enquist, CAF; Gerst, KL; Kellermann, JL; Posthumus, EE; Denny, EG; Guertin, P; Marsh, L; Weltzin, JF","Changes in the timing of plant and animal life cycle events, in response to climate change, are already happening across the globe. The impacts of these changes may affect biodiversity via disruption to mutualisms, trophic mismatches, invasions and population declines. To understand the nature, causes and consequences of changed, varied or static phenologies, new data resources and tools are being developed across the globe. The USA National Phenology Network is developing a long-term, multi-taxa phenological database, together with a customizable infrastructure, to support conservation and management needs. We present current and potential applications of the infrastructure, across scales and user groups.

"Effect of a Seasonal Fishery Closure on Sardine and Mackerel Catch in the Visayan Sea, Philippines","Bagsit, FU; Frimpong, E; Asch, RG; Monteclaro, HM","The implementation of seasonal fishery closures (SFC) can be controversial due to the frequent lack of clear objectives, monitoring and empirical evidence of management success. In the Philippines, an SFC implemented for the conservation of important fishery commodities in the Visayan Sea has been ruled a success after stricter implementation of this fishery policy in 2012. However, a comprehensive, detailed, and robust analysis of this fishery policy is lacking. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) framework, we estimated the effect of SFC on the interannual and seasonal catch for sardine and mackerel. We expanded our analysis to other species not regulated under the SFC policy. We also conducted semi-structured interviews (N = 235), focus group discussions (N = 9) and key informant interviews (N = 37) involving municipal fisheries stakeholders in the surrounding municipalities around the Visayan Sea, and representatives from the government and non-government agencies, to complement our analyses. Seasonal analyses of catch data show a significant increase in sardine catch at the end of the seasonal closure among SFC-participating provinces. However, overall, the SFC had no significant effect on sardine interannual catch among the provinces participating in the SFC. We also found no significant effect of the SFC on interannual and seasonal catch for mackerel. Furthermore, our findings show no significant changes in fishing pressure to other aquatic species. Interview results corroborate our DID findings for mackerel, but not for sardine. The varying perceptions on the outcomes of the SFC policy can be attributed to several challenges such as lack of implementing guidelines, lack of alternative livelihoods for the affected stakeholders, persistence of illegal fishing, and uneven implementation of the SFC. Since the management objective of this SFC was to conserve the regulated species, alternative management measures may be needed to achieve this goal. This could entail more consistent enforcement, improved cooperation and communication between fisheries managers and stakeholders, fish size or gear restrictions, and identification and conservation of key habitats needed to restore overexploited species.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000669508800001,10.3389/fmars.2021.640772,,#19636,Bagsit 2021,,
Advancing sea turtle conservation in the South China Sea via US-China diplomacy,"Yeh, FC; Lin, L; Zhang, T; Green, R; Martin, F; Shi, HT","The South China Sea is an important oceanic habitat for endangered sea turtles, which are facing anthropogenic pressures from the illegal wildlife trade, fisheries by-catch, debris pollution, habitat loss, and climate change. Compounding these threats are international disputes over territorial claims in the South China Sea, exerting a general disinclination toward regional collaborations to solve environmental issues. Since sea turtles are migratory animals that move through aquatic and terrestrial habitats, feeding in waters, and nesting on beaches under the jurisdiction of multiple countries, the species is an ideal ambassador to raise public support for international collaborations. Transnational communications to coordinate conservation efforts across borders provide a positive agenda of cooperation to build trust, creating a politically neutral platform to facilitate opportunities for diplomacy to reset and improve foreign relations, underscoring the value of sea turtles as a flagship species to reduce international tensions and bring nations together. For this reason, the U.S.-China EcoPartnership between Sea Turtles 911 and Hainan Normal University was formed to empower local communities to protect the ocean through sea turtle rescue, public education, and scientific research projects. Genetic research determined the geographic origins of illegally traded sea turtles, validating the uniqueness of the Paracel (Xisha) Islands rookery, and urging policymakers to establish a large-scale sea turtle nature reserve in the South China Sea. To define boundaries of the proposed marine protected area, sea turtles were tracked with satellite telemetry delineating their migratory routes and habitats across multiple countries, underscoring the importance of international collaborations. Debris pollution survey at a major turtle nesting beach in the Paracel Islands demonstrated that pollution is negatively impacting newborn turtle hatchlings and that regional cooperation in the South China Sea should promote the reduction and cleanup of marine debris. Laparoscopic surgery was performed on sea turtles for the first time in China to assess the gender ratio of the local population, which revealed a female biased ratio, indicative of the effects of climate change. A sea turtle rescue center was jointly established in which more than 100 sea turtles were successfully rescued and released by the international and local community, including students who won national awards for their volunteer service. Implementing grassroots initiatives for sea turtle conservation have become an ideal diplomatic channel to strengthen U.S.-China relations as several diplomats, including U.S. Ambassador Max Baucus, have engaged in people-to-people exchanges during public educational events. This international partnership serves as a case example in which current political disputes can be set aside to prepare future generations for the existential threat of biodiversity loss and climate change, while increasing peace, stability, and turtles in the region.",2021,,ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY,40,5,,WOS:000639239700001,10.1002/ep.13643,,#19637,Yeh 2021,,
Results of efforts by the Convention on Biological Diversity to describe ecologically or biologically significant marine areas,"Bax, NJ; Cleary, J; Donnelly, B; Dunn, DC; Dunstan, PK; Fuller, M; Halpin, PN","In 2004, Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) addressed a United Nations (UN) call for area-based planning, including for marine-protected areas that resulted in a global effort to describe ecologically or biologically significant marine areas (EBSAs). We summarized the results, assessed their consistency, and evaluated the process developed by the Secretariat of the CBD to engage countries and experts in 9 regional workshops held from 2011 to 2014. Experts from 92 countries and 79 regional or international bodies participated. They considered 250 million km(2) of the world's ocean area (two-thirds of the total). The 204 areas they examined in detail differed widely in area (from 5.5 km(2) to 11.1 million km(2)). Despite the initial focus of the CBD process on areas outside national jurisdiction, only 31 of the areas examined were solely outside national jurisdiction. Thirty-five extended into national jurisdictions, 137 were solely within national jurisdictions, and 28 included the jurisdictions of more than 1 country (1 area lacked precise boundaries). Data were sufficient to rank 88-99% of the areas relative to each of the 7 criteria for EBSAs agreed to previously by Parties to the CBD. The naturalness criterion ranked high for a smaller percentage of the EBSAs (31%) than other criteria (51-70%), indicating the difficulty in finding relatively undisturbed areas in the ocean. The highly participatory nature of the workshops, including easy and consistent access to the relevant information facilitated by 2 technical teams, contributed to the workshop participants success in identifying areas that could be ranked relative to most criteria and areas that extend across jurisdictional boundaries. The formal recognition of workshop results by the Conference of Parties to the CBD resulted in these 204 areas being identified as EBSAs by the 196 Parties. They represent the only suite of marine areas recognized by the international community for their greater importance for biodiversity it is their importance for biodiversity itself not conservation as process explicitly excluded management issues than their surroundings. This comes at a critical juncture in negotiations at the UN that will consider developing a new implementation agreement under UN Convention of the Law of the Sea to support the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. The EBSA description process is a good example of how to bring the international community together to build a shared understanding of which ocean areas are particularly valuable to biodiversity.",2016,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,30,3,571-581,WOS:000379945600014,10.1111/cobi.12649,,#19640,Bax 2016,,
Governance for responsible fisheries: an ecosystem approach,"Sissenwine, MP; Mace, PM","The term, 'responsible' can be interpreted in many ways. For fisheries, we believe responsible means sustainable production of human benefits, which are distributed 'fairly', without causing unacceptable changes in marine ecosystems. Governance is broader than fisheries management. It consists of formal and informal rules, and understandings or norms that influence behaviour. Responsible fisheries requires self-governance by the scientific community, the fishing industry and the public (including politicians), as well as responsible fisheries management. An ecosystem approach to fisheries management, also known as ecosystem-based fisheries management, is geographically specified fisheries management that takes account of knowledge and uncertainties about, and among, biotic, abiotic and human components of ecosystems, and strives to balance diverse societal objectives.Much has been written about the principles that should underlie an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. The key elements of the approach should be: (i) goals and constraints that characterize the desired state of fisheries and undesirable ecosystem changes; (ii) conservation measures that are precautionary, take account of species interactions and are adaptive; (iii) allocation of rights to provide incentives for conservation; (iv) decision making that is participatory and transparent; (v) ecosystem protection for habitat and species of special concern; and (vi) management support, including scientific information, enforcement and performance evaluation. Fisheries ecosystem plans are a useful vehicle for designing and implementing fisheries management systems that capture these six elements. Such plans should highlight a hierarchy of management entities, from an ecosystem scale to the local scale of communities; ocean zoning, including marine protected areas (MPAs) and other geographically defined management measures; and specification of authorized fishing activities, with protocols required for future authorizations.The scientific community needs to govern itself so that it produces scientific information that is relevant, responsive, respected and right. A multi-faceted approach is needed, including monitoring of fisheries and ecosystems, assessments and scientific advice tailored to management needs, and strategic research investments to improve monitoring and assessments in the future. One serious problem facing scientists is the controversial nature of assessments and scientific advice. This problem needs to be addressed with a three-pronged strategy that calls for: separation of scientific institutions from management; collaborative research with the fishing industry; and transparent quality assurance of scientific advice. The last-named requires peer review, which either can be integrated into the process of preparing the advice (referred to as integrated peer review) or can be conducted following the preparation of the advice (referred to as sequential peer review). The appearance of potential conflict of interest by peer reviewers is a factor in the credibility of the peer review process.For an ecosystem approach for responsible fisheries, the fishing industry should govern itself to accept responsibility for providing fisheries information, embrace collaborative research, participate in the fishery management process and live with the outcome, comply with regulations, avoid waste and develop training to instil a responsible fishing ethic. Environmentalists and the public in general should also participate in the fisheries management process and live with the outcome. Politicians should produce legislation that is clear in intent and achievable within realistic funding levels. No one should make or condone 'end runs', which undermine fishery management decisions. All stakeholders should be respectful of other stakeholders.",2003,,RESPONSIBLE FISHERIES IN THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM,,,363-391,WOS:000227034800021,10.1079/9780851996332.0363,,#19641,Sissenwine 2003,,
Assessment and management of the North Brazil Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem,"Isaac, VJ; Ferrari, SF","The North Brazil Shelf is a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) that extends from the Caribbean Sea, in Central America, to the Parnaiba River in Brazil, and includes six countries. The area is dominated by the runoff of large rivers, including the Amazon and Orinoco, and by the intense disturbance of sediment transport, tides and currents. The sea bed is formed mainly by mud in shallow water, and by sand, mud, and gravel in deeper water. In terms of its biological productivity, this LME can be considered oligotrophic, with stratified habitats. The main source of nutrients of the euphotic layer is the local rivers and mangroves. Primary production has been limited by light and rising temperatures in recent years, factors associated with a decrease in marine primary productivity. However, the benthic fauna is very rich and unique, but poorly known. More than 500 fish species have been recorded in this LME. Demersal fish and shrimp are the main fishery resources in coastal and continental shelf waters. Fisheries account for more than 600 million USD a year with a considerable diversity of methods and scales ranging from very small to industrial. Seafood consumption is moderate to high in the local countries. Climate changes, dam building, deforestation, pollution, overfishing, tourism and aquaculture are the main threats to ecosystem productivity and habitat quality. Socioeconomic data are scant for this LME. Development is concentrated near the cities and mouths of rivers. Traditional communities in the coastal areas are culturally diverse, but invariably characterized by very low socioeconomic conditions. The Gross Domestic Product of the local countries ranges from 7,500 USD per capita in Guyana to 32,600 USD per capita in Trinidad and Tobago. Profound problems of governability are common to all six countries, and mean governance indicators reflect poor performances in all cases. The main issues are an absence of effective rule of law, political stability, and control of corruption. Fisheries are characterized by increasing effort and an absence of sustainability. Most of the fishery stocks are either fully or over exploited. This scenario can only be rectified by investments in marine protected areas and scientific research, as well as the increased participation of fishers in the development and implementation of management strategies and regulations.",2017,,ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT,22,,97-110,WOS:000405729600011,10.1016/j.envdev.2016.11.004,,#19642,Isaac 2017,,
Fishers' perception of a 35-year old exclusive Fisheries Management Zone,"Dimech, M; Darmanin, M; Smith, IP; Kaiser, MJ; Schembri, PJ","Fishers' attitudes and perceptions are critical for the success of fisheries protection areas with their associated biota. and a failure to understand fishers' behaviour may undermine the success of such fisheries management measures. In this study, we examine fishers' perception of a long-established exclusive fisheries zone around Malta and to investigate if the perceptions depend on fishers' demographic, economic, social characteristics and fishing activity of the fishers. A questionnaire survey was undertaken to evaluate the demographic characteristics, economic situation (costs and revenue) and fishers' activity and behaviour, together with their perception of the Fisheries Management Zone (FMZ). A total of 241 interview responses were analysed which was a response rate of 60%. The perception of most fishers was that the establishment of the FMZ has had an overall negative impact on their fishing activity and that the zone is not important for the protection of local fish stocks. When asked about the beneficial effect of the zone for fishers, most fishers from all backgrounds said that the zone does not benefit commercial fishers, but benefits mainly recreational fishers. The most evident differences in the perceptions and attitudes were between the full-time, part-time and recreational fishers. Fishers that have been fishing for more than 35 years and fishers from the main fishing village also had different attitudes from other fishers towards the FMZ. The results of this study suggest that the proportion of individual income derived from fishing was the strongest factor that influenced attitudinal differences, with home port and fishing experience having less important effects. The main differences in attitude among fishers were related to the protection and conservation effects of the zone, enhancement of resources and conflicts among user groups. The heterogeneity among fishers' attitudes revealed by the present study has important implications for the implementation of spatial closures. Some sectors of stakeholders may require additional incentives to accept restrictions on access if spatial management is to achieve its intended objectives. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Improving Stakeholder and Authority Cooperation among Coastal Fishing Communities using Passive Blast Monitoring Data,"IEEE; Chan, A; Hodgson, PA","An increased awareness of the mounting pressure on the marine ecosystem as well as the enormity of the recreational SCUBA dive industry has brought about a greater awareness of the challenges facing the marine environment. One key issue is destructive fishing.Destructive fishing is a blanket term used to describe a multitude of fishing methods which are low cost and extremely effective in terms of catch. However, the practice is not sustainable mainly due to the considerable wasted by-catch and irreversible damage done to critical marine eco-systems and habitats. In South-East Asia, the prevalence of destructive fishing is often precipitated by poor socio-economic conditions in coastal communities.Eradicating destructive fishing requires complex, widespread and holistic action on many levels. A proven solution is to engage the authorities and stakeholders and elicit their cooperation to implement alternative livelihood programs. One of the critical problems hindering this action is the lack of knowledge regarding the extent of any destructive fishing activity currently being carried out. It is unrealistic to expect successful practical solutions to be based upon hearsay from divers or datasets collected over the period of only a few days or even sometimes hours.Until recently most of the stakeholders involved in tackling the issue of destructive fishing have been giving the issue a low priority. There are a multitude of reasons for this. One key issue is the lack of understanding of the real situation by those stakeholders can act to reduce it. The lack of available data is a prime reason for this. Until now the approach has been to simply push the responsibility for eradication towards tacking the problem using enforcement. However without engaging and enlisting community support, this approach is impractically expensive. In addition the resources required need to continue to be continually made available, otherwise the destructive fishing will return. The enforcement approach also ignores the needs of the communities.Blast fishing is the predominant and wide-spread method of destructive fishing. It is also a useful indicator of the level of destructive fishing occurring in an area. Recent advancements in technology have made detecting it with Passive Acoustic Monitors (PAM), Passive Seismic Monitors (PSM) or Passive Blast Detectors (PBD) reliable and inexpensive. The use of passive monitoring systems allows a non-confrontational approach to be adopted. Data from these devices can be reinforced with fish and coral data to further quantify the impact of destructive fishing. Furthermore, comparing data from different areas allows the determination of whether blast fishing is a major factor impacting fish stocks in areas, especially within marine protected areas.This paper identifies some of the factors that should be utilized in the decision making for the collection and presentation of collected blast data, allowing it to be used to effectively to captivate stakeholders and elicit cooperation with the authorities. The use of passive monitoring ensures almost continuous uninterrupted data collection, effective resource allocation, and the ability to identify areas of particular interest such as blasting hot spots. An interesting finding is that the use of passive monitoring can reveal previously unknown trends and events occurring especially at night. Continued background monitoring can also be used to justify any ongoing effort that is eliminating destructive fishing practices.",2018,,2018 OCEANS - MTS/IEEE KOBE TECHNO-OCEANS (OTO),,,,WOS:000465206800123,,,#19653,IEEE 2018,,
Citizen science datasets reveal drivers of spatial and temporal variation for anthropogenic litter on Great Lakes beaches,"Vincent, A; Drag, N; Lyandres, O; Neville, S; Hoellein, T","Accumulation of anthropogenic litter (AL) on marine beaches and its ecological effects have been a major focus of research. Recent studies suggest AL is also abundant in freshwater environments, but much less research has been conducted in freshwaters relative to oceans. The Adopt-a-BeachTM (MB) program, administered by the Alliance for the Great Lakes, organizes volunteers to act as citizen scientists by collecting and maintaining data on AL abundance on Great Lakes beaches. Initial assessments of the AAB records quantified sources and abundance of AL on Lake Michigan beaches, and showed that plastic AL was >75% of AL on beaches across all five Great Lakes. However, AAB records have not yet been used to examine patterns of AL density and composition among beaches of all different substrate types (e.g., parks, rocky, sandy), across land-use categories (e.g., rural, suburban, urban), or among seasons (i.e., spring, summer, and fall). We found that most AL on beaches are consumer goods that most likely originate from beach visitors and nearby urban environments, rather than activities such as shipping, fishing, or illegal dumping. We also demonstrated that urban beaches and those with sand rather than rocks had higher AL density relative to other sites. Finally, we found that AL abundance is lowest during the summer, between the US holidays of Memorial Day (last Monday in May) and Labor Day (first Monday in September) at the urban beaches, while other beaches showed no seasonality. This research is a model for utilizing datasets collected by volunteers involved in citizen science programs, and will contribute to AL management by offering priorities for AL types and locations to maximize AL reduction.

The purpose is to construct the connectivity of ecology, social economy, culture and system, and to study the management of marine protected areas (MPAs) from a broader perspective. The survey method used in this study is similar to that of 'SolVES' method, which aims to assess relative importance of social value for Marine Park and discuss people's attitudes towards the future development of Marine Park and management of Marine Park. We selected purposive sampling survey according to the occupation category, and obtained 109 and 102 valid questionnaires in PPMP and GMMP respectively. In this study, four sets of questions, including familiarity with Marine Park, attitude toward use of Marine Park, understanding of social-value of Marine Park and personal profile, were designed to analyze differences between PPMP in Malaysia and GMMP in Indonesia. For both Marine Parks Biological Diversity Value (B) was scored the highest among all ten social-values. The participation rate of marine education in both Marine Parks are relatively low; both of them are no more than 35%. Compared with locals, tourists value biodiversity more, and while comparison among different occupations, civil servants value biodiversity more than other occupations. Through on-the-spot investigation and sorting out the management problems of marine parks reflected by respondents, we found that: (a) the weakness of basic education and lack of popular science publicity and education activities have caused the level of public's awareness of environmental protection to be not high enough; (b) the relative insufficiency of tourism infrastructure and increase in number of tourists in recent years, might have caused many problems such as destroying coral reef resources and littering. Some suggestions were put forward to solve the problem: (a) promote public awareness of environmental protection through popular science publicity and education; (b) for PPMP, the restriction on the number of tourists will benefit the protection of coral, while improving infrastructure, such as garbage collection, will help improve environmental pollution; (c) for GMMP, strengthening the synergy between local and central governments will help to deal with the relationship between land use and environmental protection and highlight environmental protection functions.",2019,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,173,,9-Jan,WOS:000465057000001,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.02.010,,#19658,Chen 2019,,

Global biodiversity declined between 2000 and 2010, and there are indications that the decline was greater in freshwater than in terrestrial or marine systems. However, the data, tools and methods available during that decade were inadequate to reliably quantify this decline. Recent advances in freshwater monitoring make a global assessment now close to becoming feasible. Here we identify priorities for freshwater biodiversity assessment for 2020 and 2030, based on the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) framework. We identify 22 priority activities for 2020 under three of the EBV classes (species populations, community composition, and ecosystem structure), which include: a globally systematic approach to collecting and assessing species data, collating existing and new data within global platforms, coordinated effort towards mapping wetland extent at high spatial resolution, linking in-situ data to modelling across regions, and mobilising citizen science for the collection and verification of data. Accomplishing these will allow the state of global biodiversity to be assessed according to a Red List Index with expanded geographic and taxonomic cover, an improved freshwater Living Planet Index with a greater number and phylogenetic range of species, measures of alpha and beta diversity, and globally-consistent estimates of wetland extent. To assess variables in the other EBV classes (genetic composition, species traits, and ecosystem function) we identify 15 priorities, which include development of environmental DNA methods, species-traits databases, eco-informatics and modelling over the next 15 years.

"An obligate beach bird selects sub-, inter- and supra-tidal habitat elements","Ehmke, G; Maguire, GS; Bird, T; Ierodiaconou, D; Weston, MA","Few habitat models are available for widespread, obligate, high-energy sandy shore vertebrates, such as the Eastern Hooded Plover Thinornis cucullatus cucullatus. We examined habitat attributes which determined the difference between sites where plovers breed and randomly-selected absence sites (determined from long-term systematic monitoring). A variety of habitat variables were derived from aerial photography and bathymetric and terrestrial Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data. Logistic regression against eight candidate variables, in a model selection framework, revealed considerable support for four variables with respect to explaining the presence of breeding territories. In particular, the amount of unvegetated dune and foredune which was unvegetated, and the amount of intertidal and sub-tidal reef were positively associated with the presence of breeding territories. Thus, plovers apparently select certain habitat in which to breed, involving sub-tidal, intertidal and supra-tidal habitat elements. The model also helps explain the virtual absence of breeding plovers from long sections of superficially suitable habitat, such as the fourth longest continuous beach in the world.

Effects of site-selection bias on estimates of biodiversity change,"Mentges, A; Blowes, SA; Hodapp, D; Hillebrand, H; Chase, JM","Estimates of biodiversity change are essential for the management and conservation of ecosystems. Accurate estimates rely on selecting representative sites, but monitoring often focuses on sites of special interest. How such site-selection biases influence estimates of biodiversity change is largely unknown. Site-selection bias potentially occurs across four major sources of biodiversity data, decreasing in likelihood from citizen science, museums, national park monitoring, and academic research. We defined site-selection bias as a preference for sites that are either densely populated (i.e., abundance bias) or species rich (i.e., richness bias). We simulated biodiversity change in a virtual landscape and tracked the observed biodiversity at a sampled site. The site was selected either randomly or with a site-selection bias. We used a simple spatially resolved, individual-based model to predict the movement or dispersal of individuals in and out of the chosen sampling site. Site-selection bias exaggerated estimates of biodiversity loss in sites selected with a bias by on average 300-400% compared with randomly selected sites. Based on our simulations, site-selection bias resulted in positive trends being estimated as negative trends: richness increase was estimated as 0.1 in randomly selected sites, whereas sites selected with a bias showed a richness change of -0.1 to -0.2 on average. Thus, site-selection bias may falsely indicate decreases in biodiversity. We varied sampling design and characteristics of the species and found that site-selection biases were strongest in short time series, for small grains, organisms with low dispersal ability, large regional species pools, and strong spatial aggregation. Based on these findings, to minimize site-selection bias, we recommend use of systematic site-selection schemes; maximizing sampling area; calculating biodiversity measures cumulatively across plots; and use of biodiversity measures that are less sensitive to rare species, such as the effective number of species. Awareness of the potential impact of site-selection bias is needed for biodiversity monitoring, the design of new studies on biodiversity change, and the interpretation of existing data.",2021,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,35,2,688-698,WOS:000573176200001,10.1111/cobi.13610,,#19663,Mentges 2021,,

In the last years, the Indo-Pacific lionfish, Pterois volitans, has become one of the most highly surveyed biological invasions in Western Atlantic Ocean. This predator fish has the potential to affect the invaded ecosystem due to its voracity, fast population growth, and strong competition with native fauna for resources, which in turn implies a threat to coral reefs. A common strategy addressing this invasion relies on culling, which requires systematic volunteer's efforts on given areas of lionfish abundance to be effective. Understanding volunteer's perceptions towards this invasion is vital to engaging volunteers in culling campaigns. Here, we analyze perceptions, based on open questions, Likert-scale type, and Damage Schedule format, of volunteers (diver-fishermen and recreational divers), towards lionfish in the Parque Nacional Arrecife Alacranes (PNAA), off northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. The results showed heterogeneous perceptions of volunteers shaped by distinct interests these groups have in the area, with diver-fishermen's concerns most related to their lobster catch and recreational divers referring mainly on uncontrolled tourism a major environmental problem in the PNAA. This scenario implies both groups remain unaware of the effects from this invasion on the coral reef ecosystem, but they showed willingness to participate in lionfish removals. A lack of robust awareness of these groups within a natural protected area in the southern Gulf of Mexico is of concern. We recommend further evaluations of users perspectives on lionfish as a threat and on lionfish as a viable market of consumption as strategy to control its population.",2020,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,193,,,WOS:000541741600004,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105225,,#19668,Cen-Lopez 2020,,
Extreme citizens science for climate justice: linking pixel to people for mapping gas flaring in Amazon rainforest,"Facchinelli, F; Pappalardo, SE; Della Fera, G; Crescini, E; Codato, D; Diantini, A; Jimenez, DRM; Mendoza, PEF; Bignante, E; De Marchi, M","In the Ecuadorian Amazon-one of Earth's last high-biodiversity wilderness areas and home to uncontacted indigenous populations-50 years of widespread oil development is jeopardizing biodiversity and feeding environmental conflicts. In 2019, a campaign to eliminate oil-related gas flaring, led by Amazonian communities impacted by fossil fuel production, resulted in an injunction against the Ecuadoran Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable Natural Resources and the Ministry of Environment and Water. On 26 January 2021 the Court of Nueva Loja issued a historical order to ban gas flaring in the Ecuadorian Amazon. The present citizen science project played an important role in this process, enabling the production of independent spatial information through participatory mapping with indigenous and farmer communities. Globally, lack of independent information about oil activities has led to the monitoring of gas flaring by satellite imagery, achieving remarkable results. However, apart from institutional and remotely sensed data, reliable spatial information on gas flaring in the Ecuadorian Amazon is not available. Therefore, we adopted the community-based participatory action research approach to develop a participatory GIS process, aiming both to provide reliable data and to support social campaigns for environmental and climate justice. This work presents the first participatory mapping initiative of gas flaring at a regional scale, carried out completely through open source data and software. Having identified 295 previously unmapped gas flaring sites through participatory mapping, we highlight that the extent of gas flaring activities is well beyond the official data provided by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Environment and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Nightfire annual datasets, which map only 24% and 33% of the sites, respectively. Seventy five of the detected sites were in the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve. Moreover, 39 of the identified sites were venting instead of flaring, a phenomenon never before documented in the Ecuadorian Amazon. This study demonstrates that, because official datasets and satellite imagery underestimate the extent of gas flaring in the Ecuadorian Amazon, community-based mapping offers a promising alternative for producing trusted, community-based scientific data. This community-produced data can support campaigns for legal recognition of human rights and environmental justice in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Finally, this study shows how local environmental conflicts can foster policy transformations that promote climate justice.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,17,2,,WOS:000745317700001,10.1088/1748-9326/ac40af,,#19669,Facchinelli 2022,,
Anthropogenic litter cleanups in Iowa riparian areas reveal the importance of near-stream and watershed scale land use,"Cowger, W; Gray, AB; Schultz, RC","Volunteer cleanup operations collect large datasets on anthropogenic litter that are seldom analyzed. Here we assess the influence of land use in both near-stream and watershed scale source domains on anthropogenic litter concentration (standing stock, kg km(-1)) in riparian zones of Iowa, USA. We utilized riparian litter concentration data on four classes of anthropogenic litter (metal, recyclable, garbage, and tires) from volunteer cleanup operations. Anthropogenic litter data were tested for correlation with near-stream and watershed scale land uses (developed, road density, agricultural, and open lands). Road density (road length/area) and developed land use (% area) were significantly correlated to anthropogenic litter, but agricultural (% area) and open lands (% area) were not. Metal objects correlated to near-stream road density (r = 0.79, p = 0.02), while garbage and recyclable materials correlated to watershed scale road density (r = 0.69, p = 0.06 and r = 0.71, p = 0.05 respectively). These differences in the important spatial scales of land use may be related to differences in transport characteristics of anthropogenic litter. Larger, denser metal objects may be transported more slowly through the water-shed/channelized system and thus, dependent on more proximal sources, whereas smaller, less dense garbage and recyclable material are likely transported more rapidly, resulting in concentrations that depend more on watershed scale supply. We developed a linear regression model that used near-stream road density and the total amount of observed litter to predict an average anthropogenic litter density of 188 kg km(-1) and a standing stock of 946 t in all Iowa streams (>4th Strahler order). The techniques employed in this study can be applied to other professional and volunteer litter datasets to develop prevention and cleanup efforts, inform investigations of process, and assess management actions.

Plastic in surface waters of the Inside Passage and beaches of the Salish Sea in Washington State,"Davis, W; Murphy, AG","We summarize results of two independent studies on plastic pollution in the marine environment that overlap in time and space. One study evaluated the abundance of anthropogenic debris on 37 sandy beaches bordering the Salish Sea in Washington State while the other characterized plastic debris in surface waters of the Salish Sea and the Inside Passage to Skagway, Alaska. Both studies concluded that foam, primarily expanded polystyrene was the dominant pollutant. Plastic was found in surface waters the full length of the Inside Passage but was concentrated near harbors. At the wrack line, an average square meter of Washington's 1180 km of sandy beaches in the Salish Sea had 61 pieces of anthropogenic debris weighing approximately 5 g. The total loading for the entire 1 m wide band is estimated to be 72,000,000 pieces and 5.8 metric tons. Most anthropogenic debris on beaches is generated within the region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Humboldt Current System of northern and central Chile,"Thiel, M; Macaya, EC; Acuna, E; Arntz, WE; Bastias, H; Brokordt, K; Camus, PA; Castilla, JC; Castro, LR; Cortes, M; Dumont, CP; Escribano, R; Fernandez, M; Gajardo, JA; Gaymer, CF; Gomez, I; Gonzalez, AE; Gonzalez, HE; Haye, PA; Illanes, JE; Iriarte, JL; Lancellotti, DA; Luna-Jorquerai, G; Luxoroi, C; Manriquez, PH; Marin, V; Munoz, P; Navarrete, SA; Perez, E; Poulin, E; Sellanes, J; Sepulveda, HH; Stotz, W; Tala, F; Thomas, A; Vargas, CA; Vasquez, JA; Vega, JMA","The Humboldt Current System (HCS) is one of the most productive marine ecosystems on earth. It extends along the west coast of South America from southern Chile (similar to 42 degrees S) up to Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands near the equator. The general oceanography of the HCS is characterised by a predominant northward flow of surface waters of subantarctic origin and by strong upwelling of cool nutrient-rich subsurface waters of equatorial origin. Along the coast of northern and central Chile, upwelling is localised and its occurrence changes from being mostly continuous (aseasonal) in northern Chile to a more seasonal pattern in southern-central Chile. Several important upwelling centres along the Chilean coast are interspersed with long stretches of coast without or with sporadic and less intense upwelling. Large-scale climatic phenomena (El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO) are superimposed onto this regional pattern, which results in a high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, complicating the prediction of ecological processes along the Chilean coast. This limited predictability becomes particularly critical in light of increasing human activities during the past decades, at present mainly in the form of exploitation of renewable resources (fish, invertebrates and macroalgae). This review examines current knowledge of ecological processes in the HCS of northern and central Chile, with a particular focus on oceanographic factors and the influence of human activities, and further suggests conservation strategies for this high-priority large marine ecosystem. Along the Chilean coast, the injection of nutrients into surface waters through upwelling events results in extremely high primary production. This fuels zooplankton and fish production over extensive areas, which also supports higher trophic levels, including large populations of seabirds and marine mammals. Pelagic fisheries, typically concentrated near main upwelling centres (20-22 degrees S, 32-34 degrees S, 36-38 degrees S), take an important share of the fish production, thereby affecting trophic interactions in the HCS. Interestingly, El Nino (EN) events in northern Chile do not appear to cause a dramatic decline in primary or zooplankton production but rather a shift in species composition, which affects trophic efficiency of and interactions among higher-level consumers. The low oxygen concentrations in subsurface waters of the HCS (oxygen-minimum zone, OMZ) influence predator-prey interactions in the plankton by preventing some species from migrating to deeper waters. The OMZ also has a strong effect on the bathymetric distribution of sublittoral soft-bottom communities along the Chilean coast. The few long-term studies available from sublittoral soft-bottom communities in northern and central Chile suggest that temporal dynamics in abundance and community composition are driven by interannual phenomena (EN and the extent and intensity of the OMZ) rather than by intra-annual (seasonal) patterns. Macrobenthic communities within the OMZ are often dominated in biomass by sulphide-oxidising, mat-forming bacteria. Though the contribution of these microbial communities to the total primary production of the system and their function in structuring OMZ communities is still scarcely known, they presumably play a key role, also in sustaining large populations of economically valuable crustaceans.Sublittoral hard bottoms in shallow waters are dominated by macroalgae and suspension-feeder reefs, which concentrate planktonic resources (nutrients and suspended matter) and channel them into benthic food wbs. These communities persist for many years and local extinctions appear to be mainly driven by large-scale events such as EN, which causes direct mortality of benthic organisms due to lack of nutrients/food, high water temperatures, or burial under terrigenous sediments from river runoff. Historic extinctions in combination with local conditions (e.g., vicinity to upwelling centres or substratum availability) produce a heterogeneous distribution pattern of benthic communities, which is also reflected in the diffuse biogeographic limits along the coast of northern-central Chile. Studies of population connectivity suggest that species with highly mobile planktonic dispersal stages maintain relatively continuous populations throughout most of the HCS, while populations of species with limited planktonic dispersal appear to feature high genetic structure over small spatial scales. The population dynamics of most species in the HCS are further influenced by geographic variation in propagule production (apparently caused by local differences in primary production), by temporal variation in recruit supply (caused by upwelling events, frontal systems and eddies), and topographically driven propagule retention (behind headlands, in bay systems and upwelling shadows). Adults as well as larval stages show a wide range of different physiological, ecological and reproductive adaptations. This diversity in life-history strategies in combination with the high variability in environmental conditions (currents, food availability, predation risk, environmental stress) causes strong fluctuations in stocks of both planktonic and benthic resources. At present, it remains difficult to predict many of these fluctuations, which poses particular challenges for the management of exploited resources and the conservation of biodiversity in the HCS. The high spatiotemporal variability in factors affecting ecological processes and the often-unpredictable outcome call for fine-scale monitoring of recruitment and stock dynamics. In order to translate this ecological information into sustainable use of resources, adaptive and co-participative management plans are recommended. Identification of areas with high biodiversity, source and sink regions for propagules and connectivity among local populations together with developing a systematic conservation planning, which incorporates decision support systems, are. important tasks that need to be resolved in order to create an efficient network of Marine Protected Areas along the coast of northern-central Chile. Farther offshore, the continental shelf and the deep-sea trenches off the Chilean coast play an important role in bio-geochemical cycles, which may be highly sensitive to climatic change. Research in this area should be intensified, for which modern research vessels are required. Biodiversity inventories must be accompanied by efforts to foster taxonomic expertise and museum collections (which should integrate morphological and molecular information). Conservation goals set for the next decade can only be achieved with the incorporation of local stakeholders and the establishment of efficient administrative structures.The dynamic system of the HCS in northern-central Chile can only be understood and managed efficiently if a fluent communication between stakeholders, administrators, scientists and politician is guaranteed.",2007,,"OCEANOGRAPHY AND MARINE BIOLOGY, VOL 45",45,,195-344,WOS:000252476600006,10.1201/9781420050943,,#19675,Thiel 2007,,
Road kills in tropical ecosystems: a review with recommendations for mitigation and for new research,"Monge-Najera, J","While roads are indispensable for modern civilization and beneficial for many wildlife species, they have been causing mortality from collisions since high speed chariots were invented 4 000 years ago. Most scientific work about road kill has been done in temperate ecosystems, but some authors have suspected that they have different characteristics in tropical ecosystems. In this review, I summarize publications that focus on road kills in tropical countries from Africa, America, Asia and Oceania. I found 73 studies that focus on tropical road kills. Output increased after 2011 and the most productive countries, in articles per capita, are Costa Rica, Colombia and Brazil. Most studies report that mammals are the main victims, but bird deaths are severely underestimated and amphibians suffer mass mortality in reproductive concentrations. Every road victim is itself a small ecosystem that contains thousands of microscopic species, but ""Road Kill Microbiology"" is yet to be developed as a new branch of research. No generalization can be made about the role of season or habitat in road kills because pooled data hide individual trends: researchers should keep separate records by age, sex, species, time of day, season and place; otherwise important patterns will be missed. There is not a single study, tropical or temperate, that can completely answer how many animals are killed, where, or when, because many victims are removed by scavengers, end outside the road or are too small to be noticed. Significant contributions from the tropics include emphasis on the ethical use of road kill for research, inclusion of species other than wild vertebrates, study of often overlooked phenomena like hour of day and failed versus successful crossing attempts, and the value of speed control in mitigation. The so-called ""citizen science"" can identify the most affected species but produces data that are very different from those generated by professional scientists in terms of the proportion of affected groups. Real speed limitation is the simplest effective mitigation measure. Tropical scientists should concentrate on monitoring and experimental studies to fully understand the ecology of road kills and to make a contribution that matches what rich countries do.",2018,,REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,66,2,722-738,WOS:000438605300017,10.15517/rbt.v66i2.33404,,#19678,Monge-Najera 2018,,
Biomonitoring acidification using marine gastropods,"Marshall, DJ; Abdelhady, AA; Wah, DTT; Mustapha, N; Godeke, SH; De Silva, LC; Hall-Spencer, JM","Ocean acidification is mainly being monitored using data loggers which currently offer limited coverage of marine ecosystems. Here, we trial the use of gastropod shells to monitor acidification on rocky shores. Animals living in areas with highly variable pH (8.6-5.9) were compared with those from sites with more stable pH (8.6-7.9). Differences in site pH were reflected in size, shape and erosion patterns in Nerita chamaeleon and Planaxis sulcatus. Shells from acidified sites were shorter, more globular and more eroded, with both of these species proving to be good biomonitors. After an assessment of baseline weathering, shell erosion can be used to indicate the level of exposure of organisms to corrosive water, providing a tool for biomonitoring acidification in heterogeneous intertidal systems. A shell erosion ranking system was found to clearly discriminate between acidified and reference sites. Being spatially-extensive, this approach can identify coastal areas of greater or lesser acidification. Cost-effective and simple shell erosion ranking is amenable to citizen science projects and could serve as an early-warning-signal for natural or anthropogenic acidification of coastal waters.

Uncovered pathways: Modelling dispersal dynamics of ship-mediated marine introduced species,"Letschert, J; Wolff, M; Kluger, LC; Freudinger, C; Ronquillo, J; Keith, I","Marine traffic is the main vector for marine non-indigenous species (NIS) that may hitchhike in ballast water tanks or attached to vessel hulls. Understanding marine traffic dynamics and estimating the associated risk of NIS dispersal reveals points of leverage for preventive NIS management. This study presents a method to quantify the risk of ship hull fouling-mediated NIS dispersal and identifies main dispersal hubs in marine traffic networks. We use the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) as a case study to test the applicability of this method.Ship position data derived from the automatic identification system (AIS) served as a basis for a network consisting of nodes (moorings and anchorages) and edges (ship routes). Wetted surface areas (WSA) describe the parts of vessel hulls submerged by water and were used to parameterize dispersal risks of individual vessels. We combined the constructed network with a numeric dispersal model and sequentially removed network elements to test their effectiveness on decreasing the overall dispersal capacity.Marine traffic hotspots, such as ports and popular marine visitor sites, represented the main dispersal hubs and incoming edges into the GMR crucial links for the overall dispersal capacity. The removal of passenger vessels had the strongest effect on the overall dispersal capacity, reducing it to 1%.Based on our findings, we suggest management recommendations to curb the spread of marine NIS in the GMR, including the implementations of (a) vessel hull controls at main dispersal hubs (ports); (b) species monitoring programmes at popular marine visitor sites and (c) hull husbandry regulations for passenger vessels.Synthesis and application. In an increasingly connected world, the development of risk assessments for marine non-indigenous species (NIS) dispersal is a crucial step towards the sustainable use and protection of marine ecosystems in Galapagos and other places. The presented methodology is solely based on the pathway component and thus applicable to any place with available ship position data. Therefore, it may provide useful baseline information for preventive measurements especially in places where ecological data about NIS are scarce.",2021,,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,58,3,620-631,WOS:000600682800001,10.1111/1365-2664.13817,,#19683,Letschert 2021,,
Implications of Community-Based Management of Marine Reserves in the Philippines for Reef Fish Communities and Biodiversity,"Marriott, SE; Cox, C; Amolo, RC; Apistar, D; Mancao, RH; de Mutsert, K","Overfishing and destructive fishing practices are major threats to marine biodiversity in the Philippines, where over 1.9 million small-scale fishers are supported by these biodiverse marine communities. Nearly 50% of all marine fish capture in the Philippines is from artisanal fisheries, with much of it not reported or under-reported. Marine reserves, where fishing is prohibited have been created in many local government units to help restore and preserve this biodiversity. The success of these marine reserves is still under serious debate with effective management still representing a significant challenge. The lack of a governance system to centrally managed marine reserves has resulted in non-governmental organizations developing community-based management schemes. Using independent fisheries data from Rare's Fish Forever program, we applied PERMANOVA, SIMPER and biodiversity index analyses to evaluate the community structure of reef fish in 20 sites within the Philippines. We analyzed the differences in fish assemblage inside and outside of these marine reserves, before and after community-based management had been implemented. We provide evidence that: (i) fish community structure changes within marine reserves after community-based management strategies are implemented; and (ii) community-based management of marine fisheries resources protects and promotes biodiversity inside, and in some cases, outside marine reserves. Variability across sites suggests that other social or ecological factors may be influencing the ability of marine reserves to fully protect biodiversity and marine resources. Small-scale fishers in the Philippines participate in mixed-catch harvests and depend on biodiversity and reef community structure for their livelihoods. Thus, this work has implications on how community-based management strategies for marine reserves and adjacent waters may be beneficial for the sustainability of small-scale fishers.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000726188400001,10.3389/fmars.2021.731675,,#19685,Marriott 2021,,
Community based aquaculture in the western Indian Ocean: challenges and opportunities for developing sustainable coastal livelihoods,"Ateweberhan, M; Hudson, J; Rougier, A; Jiddawi, NS; Msuya, FE; Stead, SM; Harris, A","The small-fisheries social-ecological system in the western Indian Ocean (WIO) represents a typical social-ecological trap setting where very poor natural resources dependent coastal communities face local and global threats and engage in unsustainable practices of exploiting limited resources. Community-based aquaculture (CBA) has been implemented as an important alternative or supplementary income generating activity for minimizing the overdependence on marine natural resources and promoting biodiversity conservation. Despite its proliferation throughout the WIO region in recent decades, little is known about the degree to which CBA activities have contributed to achieving the objectives of breaking the cycle of poverty and environmental degradation and promoting community development and biodiversity conservation. In order to improve understanding of common challenges and to generate recommendations for best practice, we assessed the most common CBA activities practiced in the region through literature review and workshop discussion involving practitioners and key stakeholders. Findings indicated that despite favorable environmental conditions for various CBA practices, the sector remains underdeveloped, with few activities delivering the intended benefits for coastal livelihoods or conservation. Constraints included a shortage of seed and feed supplies, low investment, limited technical capacity and skills, insufficient political support, and lack of a clear strategy for aquaculture development. These are compounded by a lack of engagement of local stakeholders, with decision making often dominated by donors, development agencies, and private sector partners. Many of the region's CBA projects are designed along unrealistically short time frames, driven by donors rather than entrepreneurs, and so are unable to achieve financial sustainability, which limits the opportunity for capacity building and longer-term development. There is little or no monitoring on ecological and socioeconomic impacts. Except for a few isolated cases, links between CBA and marine conservation outcomes have rarely been demonstrated. Realizing the potential of CBA in contributing toward food security in the WIO will necessitate concerted investment and capacity strengthening to overcome these systemic challenges in the sector.

Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries (TURFs): State of the art and the road ahead,"Quynh, NT; Schilizzi, S; Hailu, A; Iftekhar, S","Emerging as an innovation for improving the management of overexploited fisheries around the world, rights based fisheries management systems are being implemented in the form of either species- or area-based management. While there are numerous reviews on species-based management, there have been none on area based management. To fill this gap, we undertake a critical review of the literature on area-based management systems known as ""Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries"" (or TURFs). Following an exhaustive search, seventy-nine peer-reviewed journal papers discussing the evolution, effectiveness, enforcement, and management context of TURFs were identified and selected. Review of these papers reveals that there is a growing interest in investigating the real-world effects of TURFs, both positive and negative. The variability in TURF performance appears to be due to design features, enforcement behavior of fishers, and specific contextual conditions, namely, biological fishery characteristics, socio-economic aspects of fishers, and institutional arrangements. The bulk of the published research has focused on theoretical analysis and empirical evidence based on fishers' perception and experience, And there has been little research on enforcement issues or how design features and management contexts influence performance. This review emphasizes the need for rigorous empirical analyses of TURF effects, including assessment of the cost-effectiveness of different enforcement schemes and the effects of contextual conditions on TURF performance.

Context and differentiation: Comparative analysis of two community-based fishers' organizations,"Lejano, RP; Ocampo-Salvador, A","There has evolved, as of late, a strong interest in decentralized modes of governance over fisheries and other marine resources, particularly that of community-based resource management (CBRM). However, analysis of this institutional model is hindered by simplistic, typological depictions of CBRM. We use organizational theory to argue how, within the broad category of CBRM, there exists a rich variation of institutional forms. We illustrate the analysis by showing how two ostensibly similar fishers' organizations in Batangas, Philippines, differ in important ways and, furthermore, how these differences respond to particular challenges and opportunities found in their respective contexts. We also discuss implications of this research for program evaluation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Neither bust nor boom: Institutional robustness in the beach seine fishery of southern Sri Lanka,"Deepananda, KHMA; Amarasinghe, US; Jayasinghe-Mudalige, UK","Many fisheries authorities in the world have been compelled to accept community-based management as an invaluable means to formulate fisheries management due to failures of small-scale fisheries exclusively managed by centralized units. Beach seine fishing practices in Sri Lanka are known to be institutionalized by traditional community-based coastal fisheries management systems. Eight beach seine fisher communities in southern Sri Lanka were studied, using standard ethnographic methods, to ascertain and document the rules and norms that are in general not formerly codified in writing, and evaluate empirically the compliance of institutional arrangements with Ostrom's modified design principles for long enduring common pool resources (CPR) management systems. Fishing rights were vested to the villagers as a residential proximity right. Due to this tradition, ownership of a beach seine and fishing rights at fishing territory vested them as; exclusive, primary or secondary rights. The sole authority for governing CPR was vested to community organization termed ""madel samithi"" (beach seine society), which can be treated as the local administrative unit. Institutions governing the CPR addressed the excludability problem by defining fishing territory, eligibility rules and intercommunity access rule, while subtractability problem was addressed by gear rules, temporal allocation rules, first comer rules, fishing behaviour rules, conservation rules, and rules for distribution of benefits. The study highlighted that institutional architecture of beach seine fishery of southern Sri Lanka comprised all modified design principles and, 90.9% of those exhibited higher compliance (54.5% high compliance and 36.4% - very high compliance) with modified design principles. Higher compliance of institutional arrangements with modified design principles indicates robust and stable self-governing institutions. Beach seine fishing in southern Sri Lanka is therefore an example for community-based coastal fisheries management system that relies on strong, locally crafted rules as well as evolved norms, where institutional and governance mechanisms have essentially averted the tragedy, providing significant contribution to coastal economy. Study provides the starkness to the notion that local actors in tropical community-based marine resource systems overcome the CPR dilemmas through robust self-governing institutions.

Attitudes and behaviors toward Amazon River dolphins (Inia geoffrensis) in a sustainable use protected area,"Mintzer, VJ; Schmink, M; Lorenzen, K; Frazer, TK; Martin, AR; da Silva, VMF","Negative interactions between fishers and the Amazon River dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), or boto, have increased substantially in the last few decades. Herein, we investigate these interactions with focus on assessing fisher perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors toward botos. Moreover, we evaluate the effect that the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve (MSDR) in the Brazilian Amazon, and related programs, has had on fisher attitudes and behaviors toward botos. The results suggest that interactions between fishers and botos, such as depredation and incidental entanglement, are frequent, and that the illegal harvest for botos, for use as bait, occurs in the majority of the study communities. However, the assessment revealed that most fishers have positive attitudes toward botos and that these attitudes have been influenced by participation in the MSDR activities such as research and ecotourism. Our results also highlight the importance of community-based enforcement in addressing the issue of boto harvesting. The MSDR programs have successfully promoted positive attitudes toward botos and have likely played a role in limiting boto mortality through behavioral controls, though the scope of influence of these programs has been restricted to a small geographical area. The current extent of these programs is insufficient to prevent the decline of the boto population; therefore, we suggest the MSDR model be used to improve and expand boto conservation efforts with communities in the region.",2015,,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,24,2,247-269,WOS:000348114700003,10.1007/s10531-014-0805-4,,#19693,Mintzer 2015,,
A review on the ecological quality status assessment in aquatic systems using community based indicators and ecotoxicological tools: what might be the added value of their combination?,"Martinez-Haro, M; Beiras, R; Bellas, J; Capela, R; Coelho, JP; Lopes, I; Moreira-Santos, M; Reis-Henriques, AM; Ribeiro, R; Santos, MM; Marques, JC","The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) represents a transformation of the guidelines for water quality assessment and monitoring across all EU Member States. At present, it is widely accepted that the WFD requires holistic and multidisciplinary ecological approaches by integrating multiple lines of evidence. Within the scope of the WFD, the scientific community identified clear opportunities to take advantage of an ecotoxicological line of evidence. In this context, ecotoxicological tools, namely biomarkers and bioassays, were proposed to contribute to the integration of the chemical and biological indicators, and thus to provide an overall insight into the quality of a water body. More than one decade after the publication of the WFD, we reviewed the studies that have attempted to integrate ecotoxicological tools in the assessment of surface water bodies. For this purpose, we reviewed studies providing an ecological water status assessment through more conventional community based approaches, in which biomarkers and/or bioassays were also applied to complement the evaluation. Overall, from our review emerges that studies at community level appear suitable for assessing the ecological quality of water bodies, whereas the bioassays/biomarkers are especially useful as early warning systems and to investigate the causes of ecological impairment, allowing a better understanding of the cause-effect-relationships. In this sense, community level responses and biomarkers/bioassays seem to be clearly complementary, reinforcing the need of combining the approaches of different disciplines to achieve the best evaluation of ecosystem communities' health.

Evaluating Social and Ecological Vulnerability of Coral Reef Fisheries to Climate Change,"Cinner, JE; Huchery, C; Darling, ES; Humphries, AT; Graham, NAJ; Hicks, CC; Marshall, N; McClanahan, TR","There is an increasing need to evaluate the links between the social and ecological dimensions of human vulnerability to climate change. We use an empirical case study of 12 coastal communities and associated coral reefs in Kenya to assess and compare five key ecological and social components of the vulnerability of coastal social-ecological systems to temperature induced coral mortality [specifically: 1) environmental exposure; 2) ecological sensitivity; 3) ecological recovery potential; 4) social sensitivity; and 5) social adaptive capacity]. We examined whether ecological components of vulnerability varied between government operated no-take marine reserves, community-based reserves, and openly fished areas. Overall, fished sites were marginally more vulnerable than community-based and government marine reserves. Social sensitivity was indicated by the occupational composition of each community, including the importance of fishing relative to other occupations, as well as the susceptibility of different fishing gears to the effects of coral bleaching on target fish species. Key components of social adaptive capacity varied considerably between the communities. Together, these results show that different communities have relative strengths and weaknesses in terms of social-ecological vulnerability to climate change.",2013,,PLOS ONE,8,9,,WOS:000326734500083,10.1371/journal.pone.0074321,,#19695,Cinner 2013,,
Voodoo versus fishing committees: The role of traditional and contemporary institutions in fisheries management,"Alonso, EB; Houssa, R; Verpoorten, M","We study the co-existence of two community-based institutions for fisheries management in Benin: a traditional institution embedded in the Voodoo religion and a recent secular institution in the form of fishing committees. Using household survey data on fishing activities, we find that rules of both institutions have a statistically significant but small impact on the use of unsustainable fishing gear. We further find that Voodoo fishers who break the traditional Voodoo-based rule follow the fishing committee rule to the same extent as other fishers. This finding is consistent with a possible transition from the traditional Voodoo-based institution to the secular fishing committee institution. More research is needed to fully assess the effectiveness of, and interactions between, the two institutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Community-based coral aquaculture in Madagascar: A profitable economic system for a simple rearing technique?,"Todinanahary, GGB; Lavitra, T; Andrifanilo, HH; Puccini, N; Grosjean, P; Eeckhaut, I","Since a couple of decades, coral aquaculture has been developed in many countries to face an increasing live coral market and to support conservation of endangered natural coral reefs. To evaluate the potentiality of communitybased coral aquaculture in Madagascar, we experienced suitable farming techniques using the species Acropora nasuta and Seriatopora caliendrum. Survival and growth rate of the nubbins were monitored during wet, warm and dry, cold seasons. To determine economical feasibility, the coral market was investigated and the yields were also calculated using the technical, biological and social parameters of the production. Coral nubbins were reared in situ at appropriate conditions. Coral nubbins reared during the wet, warm season showed a final survival rate of 67 +/- 6% and 57 +/- 4% respectively for A. nasuta and S. caliendrum, while in the dry, cold season, the survival rates were of 85 +/- 7% and 69 +/- 1% respectively. A. nasuta had a significantly higher survival rate than S. caliendrum during both seasons. During the wet, warm season, growth rates were 0.46 +/- 0.16% d(-1) and 0.54 +/- 0.16% d(-1) respectively for A. nasuta and S. caliendrum. In the dry, cold season, A. nasuta had 0.63 +/- 0.18% d(-1) of growth rate, while S. caliendrum grew 0.65 +/- 0.15% d(-1). Significant difference was observed between both species during the wet, warm season, but not during the dry, cold season. Furthermore, both species grew faster during the dry, cold season. These results are in the range of reference values for corals. The activity can be profitable from 25 coral nubbins sold per month. Profit can already be perceived from the second year and a total of more than EUR 27,000 earned after 5 years of developing project, for an initial investment of EUR 1978. Marine animals wholesale companies and biodiversity conservation NGOs seem to be the appropriate clients for this form of aquaculture on Madagascar.Statement of relevance: This paper provides new form of coral aquaculture: the community-based coral aquaculture.

A Social-Ecological Systems Approach to Assessing Conservation and Fisheries Outcomes in Fijian Locally Managed Marine Areas,"Jupiter, SD; Epstein, G; Ban, NC; Mangubhai, S; Fox, M; Cox, M","Locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) are often recommended as a strategy to achieve conservation and fisheries management, though few studies have evaluated their performance against these objectives. We assessed the effectiveness of eight periodically harvested closures (PHCs), the most common form of management within Fijian LMMAs, focusing on two outcomes: protection of resource units and biodiversity conservation. Of the eight PHCs, only one provided biodiversity benefits, whereas three were moderately successful in protecting resource units (targeted fish biomass). Protection of resource units was more likely when PHCs were harvested less frequently, less recently, and when total fish biomass in open areas was lower. Our findings further suggest that monitoring, enforcement, and clearly defined boundaries are critical, less frequent harvesting regimes are advised, and culturally appropriate management incentives are needed. Although PHCs have some potential to protect resource units, they are not recommended as a single strategy for broad-scale biodiversity conservation.",2017,,SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES,30,9,1096-1111,WOS:000407554200005,10.1080/08941920.2017.1315654,,#19701,Jupiter 2017,,
Creating community-based indicators to monitor sustainability of local fisheries,"Boyd, H; Charles, A","This paper presents a systematic process to create frameworks of indicators for monitoring sustainable development in fisheries at the local community level. Indicators are evaluated and selected through a three-stage process: first, potential indicators for general use in fisheries are identified; second, this set is refined for suitability within a specific local context; third, indicators are evaluated according to data-specific criteria. The results suggest that indicators suitable at larger geographic scales are often unsuitable, and insufficient, for use at a local scale. Conversely, many social, economic and institutional fishery indicators appear suitable for use locally, but their implementation has received insufficient attention to date. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Striking a balance between tradition and conservation: General perceptions and awareness level of local citizens regarding turtle conservation efforts based on age factors and gender,"Abd Mutalib, AH; Fadzly, N; Foo, R","The population of marine green turtle (Chelonia mydas) has been severely declining annually, emphasizing the importance of conservation actions to rectify the situation. The population decline is mostly caused by rampant human activities and lack of awareness for the endangered animals. Current top-down management and awareness program implementation needs to be improved. For example, community-based conservation is a valuable tool to educate local communities on their obligations to the environment. This study assessed the green turtles awareness level based on age and gender of the local residents in Setiu, Terengganu, a popular ecotourism location in Malaysia. Male respondents have shown a significantly higher level of awareness compared to female (mean = 28.862 +/- 0.494, (F(1, 770) = 16.688, p < 0.001). Assessment based on the age factor has shown that older respondents scored significantly lowest than other age groups (mean = 21.1899 +/- 1.0595, (F(1, 770) = 8.967, p < 0.001).

Individual responsibility for the oceans? An evaluation of marine citizenship by UK marine practitioners,"McKinley, E; Fletcher, S","In recent times, the governance of the marine environment has evolved from being primarily top down and state directed to being more participatory and community based. This paper proposes that an extension of this trend would be the inculcation of a societal sense of marine citizenship to deliver the sustainable management and protection of the marine environment through enhanced individual involvement in policy development and implementation. The potential role of marine citizenship in UK marine governance was examined by surveying UK marine practitioner's views on both the current and future role of marine citizenship. Observations from this study identified three key factors for discussion including conflicting opinions over the implementation of marine citizenship into policy; that marine-focused education and a sense of personal attachment are integral to the development of marine citizenship; and that as yet, the potential implications of an enhanced sense of marine citizenship are uncertain. This research highlights the recognition amongst marine practitioners that higher levels of citizen involvement in the management of the marine environment would greatly benefit the marine environment, with additional benefits possible through an increased sense of marine citizenship.

An assessment of the current status of the chokka squid fishery in South Africa and an evaluation of alternative allocation strategies,"Cochrane, KL; Oliver, B; Sauer, W","The South African squid fishery is based on a single species, Loligo reynaudi, locally referred to as chokka and commonly found around the Agulhas Bank and West Coast shelf of South Africa. The existing long term rights for participation in the fishery expire at the end of 2013 and a new set of rights will have to be issued. Progress made to date in achieving the objectives of the South African Marine Living Resources Act of 1998 (MLRA), including progress towards greater equity, will be an important consideration in allocation decisions. The draft Small-Scale Fisheries Policy, scheduled to be adopted in 2013, could also influence the criteria to be used. This study updates the information on the current structure and functioning of the squid jig sector and considers the likely performance of two alternative access allocation scenarios against the current and evolving policy goals. The study reaffirms that the squid fishery is an important contributor to human well-being in South Africa and particularly in the Eastern Cape Province but there is scope for improvement in the extent of transformation and equity. The study concludes that, as a result of a common lack of experience and capital amongst potential new entrants, the risks associated with transformation in this fishery are likely to be high, especially if the option of allocating rights to community-based legal entities was to be used. The risks could be reduced by ensuring that a number of pre-conditions were met. These include, amongst others, not allowing total effort in the fishery to increase; ensuring effective management by the responsible government authorities; adequate capacity building of new entrants, whether individuals or cooperatives; and ensuring new entrants have viable business plans.

Fish community-based measures of estuarine ecological quality and pressure impact relationships,"Fonseca, VE; Vasconcelos, RP; Gamito, R; Pasquaud, S; Goncalves, CI; Costa, JL; Costa, MJ; Cabral, HN","Community-based responses of fish fauna to anthropogenic pressures have been extensively used to assess the ecological quality of estuarine ecosystems. Several methodologies have been developed recently combining metrics reflecting community structure and function. A fish community facing significant environmental disturbances will be characterized by a simplified structure, with lower diversity and complexity. However, estuaries are naturally dynamic ecosystems exposed to numerous human pressures, making it difficult to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic-induced changes to the biological community. In the present work, the variability of several fish metrics was assessed in relation to different pressures in estuarine sites. The response of a multimetric index (Estuarine Fish Assessment Index) was also analysed. Overall, fish metrics and the multimetric index signalled anthropogenic stress, particularly environmental chemical pollution. The fish assemblage associated with this type of pressure was characterized by lower species diversity, lower number of functional guilds, lower abundance of marine migrants and of piscivorous individuals, and higher abundance of estuarine resident species. A decreased ecological quality status, based on the EFAI, was also determined for sites associated with this pressure group. Ultimately, the definition of each pressure groups favoured a stressor-specific analysis, evidencing pressure patterns and accounting for multiple factors in a highly dynamic environment.

Indicators of marine ecosystem integrity for Canada's Pacific: An expert-based hierarchical approach,"Okey, TA","There is great interest and rapid progress around the world in developing sets of indicators of marine ecosystem integrity for assessment and management. However, the complexity of coastal marine ecosystems can challenge such efforts. To address this challenge, an expert-based, hierarchical, and adaptive approach was developed with the objectives of healthy marine ecosystems and community partnerships in monitoring and management. Small sets of the top-ranked indicators of ecosystem integrity and associated human pressures were derived from expert-rankings of lists of identified candidate indicators of the status of, and pressures on, each of 17 ecosystem features, organized within 8 elements in turn within 3 overlapping aspects of ecosystem health. Over 200 experts played a role in rating the relative value of 1035 candidate indicators. A panel of topic experts was assigned to each of the 17 ecosystem features to apply 21 weighted indicator selection criteria. Selection criteria and candidate indicators were identified through literature reviews, expert panels, and surveys, and they were evaluated in terms of the experts' judgements of importance to the health of Canada's Pacific marine ecosystems. This produced a flexible, robust, and adaptable approach to identifying representative sets of indicators for any scale and for any management unit within Canada's Pacific. At the broadest scale, it produced a top 20 list of ecosystem state and pressure indicators. These top indicators, or other sets selected for smaller regions, can then guide the development of both regional and nested local monitoring programs in a way that maximizes continuity while including locally unique values. This hierarchical expert-based approach was designed to address challenges of complexity and scale and to enable efficient selection of useful and representative sets of indicators of ecosystem integrity while also enabling the participation of broad government and stakeholder communities.

Fijian villagers adapt to changes in local fisheries,"Matthews, E; Veitayaki, J; Bidesi, VR","This paper analyzes some of the problems encountered by a village-run fishing cooperative in rural Fiji. Concern about the limited success of this fishing cooperative led the villagers of Kaba Point, Fiji to ask for biological and socioeconomic studies to determine the roots of the cooperative's problems. The villagers also required an assessment of their proposal to revitalize the cooperative through a development scheme that would enable them to increase their catch. The surveys, undertaken by researchers from the University of the South Pacific and the Fiji Fisheries Division, indicate that the area has been overfished, primarily through the widespread local and commercial use of gillnets and the reliance on fishing as a sole source of village income, and further expansion of the current resource exploitation patterns would be very damaging. In addition, although the cooperative provides an important sense of communalism in the village, only a few people regularly provide fish to the coop. The semi-subsistence lifestyle of rural Fiji is one factor limiting villagers participation in full-time fishing activities. The traditional social and management structures inherent in this village (especially, marine tenure, chiefly responsibility for the community, and a demonstrated history of communal projects) can form a strong basis for a modern community-based marine management program. However, if not carefully watched resources can also be locally mismanaged because of the increasing demands of the modern market-driven economy. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Positive ecological and socioeconomic responses to management typically lag behind immediate costs borne by fishers from fishing pressure reductions necessary for fisheries recovery. These short-term costs challenge the long-term success of these interventions. However, social marketing may increase perceptions of management benefits before ecological and socioeconomic benefits are fully realized, driving new social norms and ultimately long-term sustainable behavior change. By conducting underwater visual surveys to quantify ecological conditions and by conducting household surveys with community members to quantify their perceptions of management support and socioeconomic conditions, we assessed the impact of a standardized small-scale fisheries management intervention that was implemented across 41 sites in Brazil, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The intervention combines TURF reserves (community-based territorial use rights for fishing coupled with no-take marine reserves) with locally tailored social-marketing behavior change campaigns. Leveraging data across 22 indicators and 4 survey types, along with data from 3 control sites, we found that ecological and socioeconomic impacts varied and that communities supported the intervention and were already changing their fishing practices.

Considerations for management of metapopulations in small-scale fisheries of the Mesoamerican barrier reef ecosystem,"Seijo, JC","From all of the fishing resources in the Caribbean region, a shared metapopulation of spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) has the highest market value, which together with its abundance and wide distribution, makes it the main source of income for a large number of coastal communities. Within this region, responsible use of shared marine areas, like the Mesoamerican barrier ecosystem, where multi-gear artisanal fisheries distributed in area of resource distribution play a significant role in affecting different components of the spiny lobster population structure and, in harvesting incidentally a high diversity of reef species, require approaches to manage multiple and competing uses of this marine area. The move towards EAF in the spiny lobster fishery of the Mesoamerican barrier ecosystem should be on an incremental and adaptive management basis in view of (i) much greater uncertainties when trying to include other species, habitats, and ecological interdependencies present in this ecosystem; (ii) the time needed to learn the principles of the EAF approach and acquire knowledge and information on the Mesoamerican barrier ecosystem. This involves more extensive coverage of capacity building in the countries involved for applying EAF; and (iii) the need to carefully assess the distributional implications of EAF interventions between coastal states and within them. For artisanal fisheries, EAF objectives and principles need to be revised and expanded to better reflect social, economic and institutional implications of management decisions. The need for considering data collection, advanced modelling and risk analysis for the use of sustainability indicators and reference points within the ecosystem approaches to fishery management, is also discussed.

Single metric indices were highly variable and neither concordant amongst themselves nor with the EFAI. The EFAI was the only index significantly correlated with the API, indicating that higher ecological quality was associated with lower anthropogenic pressure.

"Health environmental assessment of the coral reef-supporting Tamandare Bay (NE, Brazil)","Barbosa, CF; Seoane, JCS; Dias, BB; Allevato, B; Brooks, POS; Gaspar, ALB; Cordeiro, RC","This study aimed to assess spatial and temporal ecosystem health variability of coral reefs in the Tamandare open embayment, located in Northeast Brazil, Southwest Atlantic Ocean, using water and sediment parameters and benthic foraminifera as bioindicators. Sediment samples were collected during the summer and winter of 2005 at the reef base, generally built over beachrock structures. The FORAM index (FI, a foraminiferal functional group, community-based water quality assessment), and the FORAM Stress Index (FSI, which is more related to ecological affinities than to functional groups and assesses sediment or substrata quality) together with geochemical data were interpreted using uni- and multi-variate analysis. This is the first application of FSI outside of Mediterranean waters. The dominance of the Quinqueloculina and Textularia, along with negligible numbers of living specimens, low counts of symbiont-bearing foraminifera (and thus low FI), high turbidity and high phosphorus concentrations confirm the anthropogenic influence of river inputs. All parameters suggest that the water and sediment of the Tamandare embayment are marginal for coral population settlement, although the FSI, which presents higher values at unpolluted ecosystems, suggests more sustainable conditions during summer than winter, as found for FI. The FI indication of marginal environmental health is not in agreement with the FSI and the currently stable coral population found over the underlying beachrock, especially at the established no-take zone where good conditions have been described. The central transect, influenced by the no-take zone, presents the most favorable sedimentary sector for conservation initiatives, as indicated by foraminifera and other variables, preferentially on the summer season due to low river discharge of sediments. Local scientific and community-based coral conservation initiatives have improved ecosystem health. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to analyze the bacterial assemblage composition of 51 estuarine and coastal stations characterized by different environmental conditions and human-derived pressures. Using the relative abundance of putative indicator bacterial taxa, we developed a biotic index that is significantly correlated with a sediment quality index calculated on the basis of organic and inorganic compound concentrations.

The change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline and programme intervention costs, both at the participant level, were used for the economic evaluation. A limited health funder perspective with costs in 2016 NZ$ was taken.Results: The per child 12-month Whanau Pakari programme costs were significantly lower than in the conventional group. In the low-intensity group, costs were NZ$939 (95% CI: 872, 1007) (US$648) lower than the conventional group. In the high-intensity intervention group, costs were NZ$155 (95% CI: 89, 219) (US$107) lower than in the conventional group. BMI SDS reductions were similar in the three groups.Conclusions: A home-based, multi-disciplinary child obesity intervention had lower programme costs per child, greater reach, with similar BMI SDS outcomes at 12 months when compared with the previous hospital-based conventional model.

Capacity building and technology transfer for improving governance of marine areas both beyond and within national jurisdiction,"Vierros, MK; Harden-Davies, H","Capacity building and technology transfer (CBTT) are vital for the success of a new international legally-binding agreement for marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. Without effective CBTT, many developing countries are unlikely to be able to fulfill their obligations in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), including by undertaking area-based management, evaluating environmental impact assessments, and benefiting from the utilization of marine genetic resources - or to realize their rights. Meanwhile, several other international commitments require varying forms of CBTT at global, regional and national levels. This article analyses areas where synergies are possible for implementing CBTT, and those where additional, ABNJ-related capacities will need to be mainstreamed for holistic ocean management. We argue that CBTT is more meaningful, effective and resource-efficient if it corresponds to the ecological realities of an interconnected ocean by linking initiatives relating to ABNJ with those within national jurisdiction. We discuss why and how CBTT is also more useful on the national level if it maximizes synergies between international policies and agreements, and allows countries to concurrently participate in a BBNJ agreement and fulfill national priorities related to sustainable development, for example by enhancing livelihoods, eradicating hunger and poverty, and building capacity for science and innovation as part of national blue economies based on healthy ocean ecosystems. The Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development offers a timely opportunity to operationalize robust CBTT measures under the BBNJ agreement and maximize synergies with other international commitments as part of broader efforts to achieve Agenda 2030.",2020,,MARINE POLICY,122,,,WOS:000598174400006,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104158,,#19723,Vierros 2020,,
Towards A Network of Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMAs) in the Western Indian Ocean,"Rocliffe, S; Peabody, S; Samoilys, M; Hawkins, JP","In the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), local communities are increasingly assuming responsibility for inshore marine resources either on their own or through collaborative management arrangements with governments or non-state actors. In this paper, we trace the evolution and expansion of community management in the WIO and present the first ever inventory and assessment of the region's locally managed marine areas (LMMAs). We compare the key attributes of these areas to those under government stewardship and assess their relative contributions to progress towards the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) target of 10% of marine and coastal ecological regions to be effectively conserved by 2020. We also explore the legal frameworks that underpin locally managed marine initiatives in Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique and Tanzania to assess the potential for future expansion. A principal finding is that whilst LMMAs protect more than 11,000 square kilometres of marine resource in the WIO, they are hampered by underdeveloped local and national legal structures and enforcement mechanisms. In our recommendations to improve local management, we suggest establishing a network of LMMA practitioners in the WIO region to share experiences and best practice.",2014,,PLOS ONE,9,7,,WOS:000339614100079,10.1371/journal.pone.0103000,,#19724,Rocliffe 2014,,
A role for partially protected areas on coral reefs: maintaining fish diversity?,"Tyler, EHM; Manica, A; Jiddawi, N; Speight, MR","1. Completely banning fishing from coral reefs is now accepted to have significant benefits for marine biodiversity and in many cases, fisheries. However, the benefits of regulating fishing on coral reefs, by restricting the methods used, or the total amount of fishing, are less well understood, even though such regulations are much more likely to be supported by fishermen.2. This study assesses whether banning illegal, destructive fishing methods and reducing the numbers of fishermen visiting from outside an area benefits a coral reef fishery, despite unregulated fishing by local fishermen using non-destructive methods.3. The abundance, biomass, mean length, and species richness of nine commercially important fish families are compared across ten independent patch reefs inside and outside the 470 km(2) Menai Bay Conservation Area in Zanzibar, Tanzania.4. Even after taking into account the effect of differences in habitat and the distance between reefs, 61% (+/- 19.7%) more fish species were found in regulated than unregulated reefs. Fish abundance, biomass, and length were not affected, suggesting that banning destructive fishing may improve biodiversity, but that further regulations may be required to improve fish stocks.

"Reef Resources, the 'Fog of Fisheries' and EBM","Appeldoorn, RS","Caribbean reef fisheries are predominantly dependent on nearshore coral reef ecosystems, which are characterised by strong habitat dependence, susceptibility to coastal impacts, diffuse landing sites, and strong multi-species and multi-gear interactions. The complexity of this socio-ecological system precludes knowing the system state in space and time sufficiently for management under a single-species approach. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) offers a distinctly different approach, one which is based on maintaining ecosystem health and productivity and focusing on system resilience. In the absence of complete data, management must be based on first principles regarding productivity and ecosystem health. These include maintaining ecosystem integrity and function, protecting habitats and water quality, applying the precautionary approach, monitoring reference points, and recognising that production has limits. These principles dictate management strategies for data collection, expanded authority, and management tactics and regulations such as marine reserve networks, closed spawning aggregations, gear restrictions to maintain trophic balance and habitats, targeted data collection and assessments, ecosystem-based or community-based metrics, and adopting co-management practices. The potential socio-ecological impacts of management failure suggest that fisheries adopt the approach of highly reliable organisations. Current activities within the Caribbean region indicate the basis for change is present, but adoption of full EBM will require refocusing and integration across multiple agencies.",2011,,TOWARDS MARINE ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT IN THE WIDER CARIBBEAN,,6,147-156,WOS:000353405800013,10.5117/9789089642424,,#19726,Appeldoorn 2011,,
Informed opportunism for conservation planning in the Solomon Islands,"Game, ET; Lipsett-Moore, G; Hamilton, R; Peterson, N; Kereseka, J; Atu, W; Watts, M; Possingham, HP","Human factors more than ecology dictate conservation opportunity and the subsequent success of implementation. This is particularly true in places such as the Solomon Islands where most terrestrial and coastal marine areas remain in community ownership. However, factors such as community support are not reliably predictable, nor easy to map, and therefore challenging to incorporate into systematic conservation plans. Here, we describe how the Lauru Land Conference of Tribal Communities and The Nature Conservancy have worked with the communities of Choiseul Province, Solomon Islands, to develop a conservation planning process that reconciles community-driven conservation opportunities, with a systematic and representation-based approach to prioritization. We suggest how sophisticated prioritization software can be used collaboratively in a community setting, to dynamically assess and guide conservation opportunities as they arise; a process of informed opportunism.",2011,,CONSERVATION LETTERS,4,1,38-46,WOS:000286986900005,10.1111/j.1755-263X.2010.00140.x,,#19727,Game 2011,,
"Associations of serum adiponectin with markers of cardio-metabolic disease risk in Indigenous Australian adults with good health, diabetes and chronic kidney disease","Hughes, JT; O'Dea, K; Piera, K; Barzi, F; Cass, A; Hoy, WE; Maclsaac, RJ; Maple-Brown, LJ","The higher serum adiponectin concentrations observed in females are often attributed to differences in adiposity or sex hormones. There is little data describing adiponectin in Indigenous Australians, and no studies examining its association with cardio-metabolic disease risk markers and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Aim: To describe the relationship of serum adiponectin with cardio-metabolic disease risk markers and kidney function in a community-based sample of Indigenous Australian adults, with particular reference to sex-specific differences.Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of a community-based volunteer sample of 548 Indigenous Australian adults (62% female), stratified into five cardio-metabolic risk groups ranging from good health (strata-1) to high cardio-metabolic risk and low measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR, <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) (strata-5). We examined serum adiponectin concentrations with cardio-metabolic risk markers, albuminuria and mGFR.Results: Indigenous Australian females had a lower than expected adiponectin concentration (3.5 mu g/ml), which was higher than males in strata 1-4 (as in other populations), but not in strata-5 (mGFR < 60, p = 0.19), and higher leptin: adiponectin ratio than other populations (7.8 ng/mu g - strata-1, healthy females; 12.2 ng/mu g - strata-3, females with diabetes and mGFR >= 90). Female-gender, HDL-cholesterol(positive), mGFR and waist: hip ratio (WHR) (inverse) were independently associated with log-adiponectin when mGFR >= 60; when mGFR < 60, female-gender was associated with 0.27 units lower log-adiponectin.Conclusion: Female-gender was not associated with higher adiponectin concentrations in Indigenous Australians with mGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). High WHR was frequent in both genders, and inversely associated with adiponectin.

Regional fisheries management organizations and the new biodiversity agreement: Challenge or opportunity?,"Haas, B; Haward, M; McGee, J; Fleming, A","In 2018, the international community began formal intergovernmental negotiations over a new legally binding instrument for the protection of marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. Protecting marine biodiversity is imperative for a sustainable future, and all the different organizations and agreements will have to work together to achieve this common goal. One of the first key principles to be agreed was to ""not undermine"" the existing legal instruments or mandates of regional and sectoral marine governance organizations. While fisheries are not being discussed during the negotiations, a marine biodiversity agreement is likely to still impact regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), due to overlapping areas of interest. This article aims to firstly, assess the potential constraints posed by the commitment to ""not undermine""; secondly, consider how aspects of the biodiversity agreement, such as area-based management and environmental impact assessments, might enhance RFMOs; and thirdly, suggest meaningful ways to ensure cooperation between RFMOs and the marine biodiversity agreement.",2021,,FISH AND FISHERIES,22,1,226-231,WOS:000572078600001,10.1111/faf.12511,,#19730,Haas 2021,,
Can marine park become an ecotourism destination? Evidence from stakeholders' perceptions of the suitability,"Chen, FG; Lai, M; Huang, HP","Scientific evaluation of the suitability of ecotourism is of great significance to the ecological protection and future development of marine parks. This study uses multi-criteria evaluation method to build the ecotourism suitability evaluation index system and evaluation model, and takes Dongshan Island in China as an example for empirical analysis. Through conceptualizing and quantifying the relationship between stakeholder perception and the suitability of marine park ecotourism development, this paper analyzes the heterogeneity of different groups, including the differences between local people and tourists, different occupational groups and groups with different educational levels, thus clarifying the problems existing in the development of marine park ecotourism, and providing reference for the further development and management of the marine park. The results show that Dongshan Island has a good carrying capacity and a certain level of tourism development foundation, which can provide opportunities for mass tourists to participate in ecotourism. However, weak environmental awareness of Dongshan Island residents will become an important obstacle to the island's ecotourism development. In terms of future development, the demand for environmental education in Dongshan Island is obvious.

Why weight for happiness? Correlates of BMI and SWB in Australia,"Robertson, S; Davies, M; Winefield, H","Despite our best medical and behavioural strategies, the physical and mental health of the overweight and obese remains compromised. In an effort to improve treatment outcomes, research has begun to focus on (1) specific BMI categories, and (2) subjective well-being (SWB), a broad construct exploring how we evaluate and experience our lives. Positive psychology is concerned with SWB, through the application of variables associated with health, happiness and optimal functioning. To date, research exploring the relationship between BMI categories and SWB is lacking for community based Australians. This study employed a cross-sectional design using an online survey method (n = 260). SWB and related variables were assessed over five BMI categories including normal, overweight, and obese classes one, two and three. Main findings suggest the class two and three obese demonstrated significantly lower scores on flourishing in comparison with the normal and overweight. The class three obese also demonstrated higher depression, and lower scores on agency and positive affect in comparison with the normal and overweight. Furthermore class two and three obese reported lower scores on pathways thinking than the overweight. Results provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that a lack of SWB may contribute to or maintain atypical BMI. Implications for treatment interventions are discussed.

Establishment of Community Managed Fisheries' Closures in Kenya: Early Evolution of the Tengefu Movement,"McClanahan, T; Muthiga, NA; Abunge, CA","Community-based management (CBM) could be an essential tool to prevent the depletion of marine resources in the Western Indian Ocean region. In Kenya, political pressure to strengthen local governance, has led to adoption of CBM as a way of reducing over-exploitation and managing the competing uses and impacts on the marine environment. Several communities in Kenya have embraced CBM and have set aside or closed previously fished areas to enhance recovery of fisheries and biodiversity. These community fisheries closures (locally called tengefu), despite being degraded, may recover to finfish abundances and biodiversity levels similar to established MPAs or above thresholds for maintaining some ecological services. Communities see their direct involvement and control of these tengefu as more likely to result in benefits flowing directly to them. Community closures are also important for articulating and resolving community values and strengthening their management capacity. Here, we describe the evolution of the tengefu movement in Kenya and combine information from focus group discussions, interviews, underwater surveys and boundary marking to evaluate the current status, opportunities and challenges facing these tengefu. We show that in some cases community closures suffer from slow and incomplete national and local legislative processes, challenges to compliance, and weak management.",2016,,COASTAL MANAGEMENT,44,1,20-Jan,WOS:000370390900001,10.1080/08920753.2016.1116667,,#19733,McClanahan 2016,,
Incentive instruments for the sustainable use of marine resources,"Greiner, R; Young, MD; McDonald, AD; Brooks, M","The Australian Government recently ratified the ""Oceans Policy"" which provides a policy framework to effectively manage the resources and uses of the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone. The Oceans Policy is to be implemented through Regional Marine Plans that are based on the notion of large marine ecosystems and have the objective to integrate sectoral commercial interests and conservation objectives. This paper makes a theoretical contribution to the development of Regional Marine Plans which will demand the specification of detailed policies for regulating the various marine uses and impacts in the respective marine regions. The paper discusses a wide range of policy instruments and exemplifies their potential role for the management of marine resources and uses. The term incentive instrument includes financial and economic instruments as well as legal and regulatory instruments, education, co-management, voluntary approaches, community-based mechanisms and research. A set of criteria is established for the evaluation of individual incentive instruments. They are further placed in the context of a series of principles for policy design. The paper explores potential management instruments to: improve water quality of streams, estuaries and oceans, create sustainable fisheries, ensure sustainable marine tourism and recreation, manage conflict between user and interest groups, ensure environmentally sound marine transport and petroleum exploration and mining.

Transforming reef fisheries management: application of an ecosystem-based approach in the USA Caribbean,"Appeldoorn, RS","Fisheries in Puerto Rico and the United States (US) Virgin Islands are predominately dependent on nearshore coral reef ecosystems and have suffered from historical overfishing. The unique characteristics of reef fisheries, including strong habitat dependence, susceptibility to coastal impacts, diffuse landing sites and strong multispecies and multigear interactions suggest that standard approaches to fisheries management, especially those typically considered by the US Regional Fishery Management Councils, would not be applicable. Current management authority is split between local and federal agencies; however, there exists no uniform context and direction to current management initiatives, which results in lost efficiencies and opportunities. Proposed here is a new vision for fisheries management that takes into consideration the local ecological and socioeconomic characteristics of fishing, is compatible with regional resources and capacity, is ecosystem based and targets full stakeholder participation. Only an ecosystem-based approach can lead fisheries management out of the trap of unrealistic data collection and analysis demands, while at the same time refocusing emphasis away from attitudes and practices that promote overfishing. Management must be based on first principles regarding the desired state of the ecosystem and initiate strategies based on these principles. The key management goal is not to maximize fisheries catch, but to maintain the ecosystem in a state that will lead to sustained production. First principles would include maintaining ecosystem integrity and function, protecting all habitats and water quality, applying the precautionary approach, monitoring reference points and recognizing that production has limits. Resulting management tactics include marine reserves (to meet multiple goals), closed spawning aggregations, gear restrictions to maintain trophic balance and habitats, targeted data collection and assessments, adopting co-management practices and using ecosystem or community-based metrics. Fisheries management must fully incorporate the tools, resources and methods available within coastal zone management and other environmental agencies, while standards within those programmes must protect ecosystem health. Implementation will require attending to structural barriers inherent within existing fisheries legislation and regulations, multiple jurisdictions and the current cultures of scientists, managers and fisherfolk. Initial efforts should focus on developing a common language and frame of reference for all stakeholders.",2008,,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,35,3,232-241,WOS:000261224500006,10.1017/S0376892908005018,,#19735,Appeldoorn 2008,,
Guidelines for coastal and marine site-planning and examples of planning and management intervention tools,"Gilman, E","Guidelines are presented for a process to plan for the sustainable management of coastal and marine ecosystems of discrete sites. The guidelines provide an agreed starting point to initiate a site-planning effort, help organize a complicated process into discrete components, incorporate principles of community-based and collaborative management, minimize the risk of conflict by directly involving representatives of all interest groups and identifying and addressing all issues at an incipient stage, promote development of a sense of ownership and support for resulting management initiatives by all stakeholders, address the cumulative effects of adverse impacts to coastal and marine environments, and implement an integrated approach by considering all interrelated elements that affect the site through the collaboration of all interest groups. Site-planning is a process of reviewing past progress and assessing current and future issues, threats, and needs to identify priority management intervention activities that will sustain ecological, economic, and cultural values; balance multiple and often incompatible objectives; address priority threats to natural ecosystem functioning; conserve ecological processes and biodiversity; achieve sustainable development; and fulfill institutional, policy, and legal needs.

Developing locally managed marine areas: Lessons learnt from Kenya,"Kawaka, JA; Samoilys, MA; Murunga, M; Church, J; Abunge, C; Maina, GW","Coastal communities in Kenya are increasingly adopting Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMAs) and by 2015, 24 had been established. Coastal communities perceive the objectives of these LMMAs are to primarily conserve fisheries and marine resources and secure alternative sources of income. In this study we examined if there are generic approaches in how these LMMAs were established, that can be used for developing national guidelines as well as have application to other locations in the western Indian Ocean region. The study involved a literature review of all documents available on the LMMAs and key informant interviews.We found LMMAs in Kenya go through five phases to become fully established and operational: i) Conceptualisation, ii) Inception, iii) Implementation, iv) Monitoring and management; and v) Ongoing Adaptive Management. We defined each stage by the activities that are taking place which determine how far a LMMA has reached in its development. The final phase is when a LMMA exists sustainably in a continuous learning process. Out of 19 LMMAs assessed, four had reached the fifth Stage of 'Ongoing Adaptive Management' though not all elements of this stage were fully operational.The Kenyan model differs from the widely known Pacific model of four phases due to an additional initial 'Conceptualisation' phase. Our results illustrate the need for full acceptance of the LMMA concept by stakeholders before progressing to the 'Inception phase.' When this step was missed many LMMAs stalled due to unaddressed training needs, incomplete involvement of stakeholders and lack of financial resources, management and operational structures. These five phases provide a useful guide for communities and other stakeholders to follow when developing LMMAs, or for those that are established and need guidance on their operations.Common factors that we found associated with the development of LMMAs were informed and committed community members, past training in community based marine resource management, a supportive legal framework, external funding and opportunities for sharing LMMA information. The occurrence of an exchange visit to an existing LMMA was invariably the trigger for a community to establish their own LMMA. Weaknesses were seen in poor enforcement on the water and inadequate ongoing education and training. Further there was very little understanding of the costs of establishing and running a LMMA, therefore long term financial sustainability was problematic. Thus, although the rapid increase in the number of LMMAs in Kenya is a conservation success, their effectiveness will be thwarted if enforcement and financial management are not addressed.

Coral reef health and effects of socio-economic factors in Fiji and Cook Islands,"Hoffmann, TC","This research focuses on coral reef health in the South Pacific region, an area of high global coral diversity. Coral reef health surrounding four island case studies in the Cook Islands and Fiji have been assessed in areas that have not been previously surveyed. This study compares four islands with barrier and fringing reefs that have different levels of economic development, population pressure, land-use practices, and marine management practices. This interdisciplinary research methodology includes both ecological and social data collection to further understanding of human environment interactions. In comparing the reefs with different socio-economic factors, this research shows that reefs with traditional systems of resources management are healthier, population pressure is not the main factor causing the demise of the reefs and agro-industry is the main industry causing the degradation of the reef in these four South Pacific Islands.

This paper evaluates the issues surrounding sanctuary establishment, the process of sanctuary implementation, management and review, conservation costs and benefits and identify a possible improved approach to resolving some of the,se identified issues. It is argued that first, a more consultative, community based and negotiated approach should have been implemented in first dealing with the dolphin accidental catch issue,. second, ongoing management by the Department of Conservation should have been adaptive rather than dogmatic, and given more respect to local views; and third, that in reviewing the Sanctuary the Department of Conservation and the Minister of Conservation should have promoted a facilitated and negotiated settlement reflecting a precautionary approach and adaptive management.

"Attitudes and perceptions of villagers toward community-based mariculture in Minahasa, North Sulawesi, Indonesia","von Essen, LM; Ferse, SCA; Glaser, M; Kunzmann, A","This study assesses how characteristics of individuals (e.g. preparedness to take risks), households (e.g. employment structure) and communities (e.g. distribution of resources) affect the chances that mariculture is successfully adopted as an alternative to fisheries. An increasing number of coastal households in tropical countries see their livelihoods endangered by declining fisheries catches. Acceptable livelihood alternatives are needed to reduce the pressure on the marine environment. Indonesian coastal communities do not always depend exclusively on fishing but often diversify their livelihood portfolios, which makes livelihood programs a relevant policy intervention for them. Sea cucumber mariculture is increasingly advocated in Indonesian coastal management. Using semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and non-participant observation, current livelihoods and the attitudes toward the possibility of sea cucumber mariculture activities were assessed in two coastal villages in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Respondents stated a high interest in alternative livelihoods. At the same time, non-economic factors such as tradition and personal gratification played an important role in decisions on whether to fish or not. Villagers' attitudes were influenced by fishery-related experiences, perceptions and understandings, as well as by previous experiences with alternative livelihood programs. The results suggest that it is easier to turn people with farming experience into aquaculturists than people who are highly focused on fishing. Moreover, the indications are that sea cucumber mariculture would remain an additional source of income rather than replace fishing. In the study area, mariculture is still an unfamiliar activity, not yet sufficiently trusted to generate willingness to invest. Villagers' general acceptance of non-fishing income alternatives will need to be promoted if livelihood alternatives are to be successful in reducing pressure on marine resources.

A multivariate approach to analyzing functional redundancy of marine periphytic ciliates during the colonization process for bioassessment in coastal ecosystems,"Xu, GJ; Zhong, XX; Warren, A; Xu, HL","Functional redundancy is a useful tool for determining functional compensation and for reducing ""signal to noise"" ratios of full-species datasets in community-based monitoring programs. The functional redundancy of marine periphytic ciliate communities during the colonization process in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, China, was analyzed using a.peeling procedure (BVSTEP). Four response units (RUs) with trophic-functional equivalents were identified from the full 77-species dataset These RUs, which comprised four, seven, six and six species respectively, represented a clear variation in trophic-functional structures across the levels of functional redundancy. RU1 was dominated by bacterivores, RU2 and RU3 first by bacterivores then by algivores, and RU4 first by non-selectives and bacterivores then by algivores.

"An unfished area enhances a spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, fishery: implications for management and conservation within a Biosphere Reserve in the Mexican Caribbean","Ley-Cooper, K; De Lestang, S; Phillips, BF; Lozano-Alvarez, E","The Caribbean spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, Latreille, is the main source of income for the communities in the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve Mexico. The fishery has recently been certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council provided that further stock assessment is carried out. A total of 379 lobsters were tagged in an unfished area offshore from the Bahia del Espiritu Santo fishing grounds to assess whether lobsters remained within these areas and were thus fully protected. The lobsters recaptured in the shallow area (5.3%) were sufficient to develop a multistate mark recapture model, which takes into account fishing and natural mortality, tag reporting rate and tag loss. This estimated that between 15 and 20% of all adult lobsters dwelling in the unfished area moved into the fishery and were subjected to exploitation. This study suggests that the offshore unfished area provides protection to the majority of the stock in this area while adding to and maintaining fishing yields within the inshore commercial fishery.",2014,,FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY,21,4,264-274,WOS:000339433300002,10.1111/fme.12072,,#19744,Ley-Cooper 2014,,
An approach to detecting species diversity of microfaunas in colonization surveys for marine bioassessment based on rarefaction curves,"Xu, GJ; Zhong, XX; Wang, YF; Xu, HL","The objective of this study was to measure alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity of microfaunas with different ages in colonization surveys using rarefaction-modeling methods. A dataset was complied based on a microperiphyton survey in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, near Qingdao. The analyses showed that: (1) there was a strong residual influence of sampling effort on beta- and gamma-diversity after rarefaction, especially for the young communities; (2) the rarefaction curves were well fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and allow modeling and removing the residual influence of sampling effort on beta- and gamma-diversity; and (3) the estimated values of alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity of a community based on the rarefaction-modeling method were independent of the influence of sampling effort. The results suggest that this approach may be used as a feasible tool to detect alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity without the influence of sampling effort in microfauna colonization surveys for marine bioassessment.

Body-size spectra of biofilm-dwelling protozoa and their seasonal shift in coastal ecosystems,"Zhao, L; Xu, GJ; Wang, Z; Xu, HL","Community-based assessment of protozoa is usually performed at a taxon-dependent resolution. As an inherent 'taxon-free' trait, however, body-size spectrum has proved to be a highly informative indicator to summarize the functional structure of a community in both community research and monitoring programs in aquatic ecosystems. To demonstrate the relationships between the taxon-free resolution of protozoan communities and water conditions, the body-size spectra of biofilm-dwelling protozoa and their seasonal shift and environmental drivers were explored based on an annual dataset collected monthly from coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, northern China. Body sizes were calculated in equivalent spherical diameter (ESD). Among a total of 8 body-size ranks, S2 (19-27 mu m), S3 (28-36 mu m), S4 (37-50 mu m) and S5 (53-71 mu m) were the top four levels in frequency of occurrence, while rank Si (13-17 mu m), S2 and S4 were the dominant levels in abundance. These dominants showed a clear seasonal succession: S2/S4 (spring) -> S2/S4 (summer) -> S4 (autumn) -> S2 (winter) in frequency of occurrence; Si (spring) -> S4 (summer) -> S2 (autumn) -> Si (winter) in abundance. Bootstrapped average analysis showed a clear seasonal shift in body-size spectra of the protozoa during a 1-year cycle, and the best-matching analysis demonstrated that the temporal variations in frequency of occurrence and abundance were significantly correlated with water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), alone or in combination with chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nutrients. Thus, the body-size spectra of biofilm-dwelling protozoa were seasonally shaped and might be used as a time and cost efficient bioindicator of water quality in marine ecosystems.

Adverse effects of long-term weight gain on microvascular endothelial function,"Coutinho, T; Turner, ST; Kullo, IJ","Background: Endothelial dysfunction is the first stage of the atherosclerotic cascade, and independently associated with cardiovascular events. We evaluated the associations of longitudinal changes in weight, waist circumference, body fat percentage and lean mass index with changes in endothelial function.Methods: 521 community-based subjects who belonged to hypertensive sibships and had no history of myocardial infarction or stroke had their anthropometric measures and endothelial function assessed a mean of 8.5 years apart. Endothelial function was assessed with brachial artery ultrasound, yielding measures of flow-mediated dilation and reactive hyperemia. We used multivariable linear regression with generalised estimating equations to assess the associations of longitudinal changes (Delta) in anthropometric measures with Delta flow-mediated dilation and reactive hyperemia, adjusting for potential confounders.Results: Mean +/- standard deviation age was 57.6 +/- 8.7 years, 58% were women, and 72% were hypertensive. Most (84%) were overweight or obese at baseline. At end of follow-up, flow-mediated dilation and reactive hyperemia increased by 1.9 +/- 7.6% and 51.2 +/- 605.8% on average, respectively. In multivariable linear regression, changes in anthropometric measures were not associated with changes in flow-mediated dilation. However, Delta weight (beta +/- SE: -9.00 +/- 2.35), Delta waist circumference (-6.78 +/- 2.21) and Delta body fat percentage (-19.72 +/- 5.62, P < 0.0001 for each) were inversely associated with Delta reactive hyperemia. Delta lean mass index was not associated with Delta reactive hyperemia.Conclusions: Long-term increases in weight, waist circumference and body fat percentage are associated with progressive worsening of microvascular endothelial function, but not conduit vessel endothelial function, in subjects without a history of cardiovascular events, independently of risk factors.

Customary sea tenure in oceania as a case of rights-based fishery management: Does it work?,"Aswani, S","This paper outlines the general characteristics of customary sea tenure (CST) in Oceania and identifies areas in which these characteristics overlap with modern rights-based fisheries management systems such as ITQs and CDQs. It also examines the effectiveness of CST regimes at regulating marine resource use and access by focusing on a particular case from the Solomon Islands. The institutional robustness or vulnerability of CST is assessed by examining various performance criteria for two communities in the Roviana Lagoon, Western Solomons. These criteria include people's (1) settlement patterns in relation to their property, (2) cultural consensus, (3) cultural attitudes with regard to governance and management, and (4) fishing efforts and yields. The results show that a number of historical processes have shaped CST systems into heterogeneous and dynamic institutions, and that CST regimes can vary even on small geographical scales. Understanding the circumstances in which CST regimes are more likely to be successful has facilitated the design and implementation of co-management fishery prescriptions (MPAs) for protecting particular species and habitats in the region. More generally, the paper proposes that by discerning the effectiveness of local governance institutions at regulating resource use and access - taking into consideration that these are embedded in particular historical and political contexts - we can better predict whether or not an introduced fishery management system will work. This knowledge can also assist in designing hybrid management schemes that cross-fertilize community-based management, modern rights-based fishery management (e.g., ITQs and CDQs), and other government regulations. This integration is particularly relevant when these policies are to be implemented in coastal communities that have or have had traditional rights-based fishery management systems of their own and/or are more socio-culturally homogeneous. Given the long history of failed fishery management, it is now of vital importance to design innovative fishery management prescriptions that integrate natural and social science research more comprehensively.",2005,,REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES,15,3,285-307,WOS:000237091300008,10.1007/s11160-005-4868-x,,#19752,Aswani 2005,,
Usefulness of deep-ocean water pumping for the seasonal monitoring of mesozooplankton,"Arima, D; Yamaguchi, A; Nobetsu, T; Imai, I","The Okhotsk Sea is the southernmost seasonally ice-covered ocean in the Northern Hemisphere. Because of the ice coverage during winter, seasonal monitoring of zooplankton is difficult by ordinary ship-board observation. To overcome this issue, zooplankton monitoring of samples collected by deep-ocean water pumping may be useful. In this study, we evaluated seasonal changes in the zooplankton community based on the samples collected by deep-ocean water pumped from a 350-m depth off of Rausu Harbor in the southern Okhotsk Sea at 2.5-day intervals over two and a half years. Zooplankton abundance and biomass ranged from 20-550 inds. m(-3) and 6-902 mg WM m(-3), respectively. Both parameters showed similar seasonal changes throughout the study period. Copepods were the most dominant taxa throughout the year and accounted for 90% and 76% of the annual mean zooplankton abundance and biomass, respectively. A total of 20 genera and 33 copepod species were observed. Metridia okhotensis and M. pacifica accounted for 61% and 12% of the annual mean copepod abundance, respectively. In general, the abundance and biomass of zooplankton collected by pumped-up deep-ocean water were lower than they were in the epipelagic layer (both characteristics of the former corresponded to approximately 60% of the latter). The combined effects of low zooplankton density at the deep layer (350 m) and the low filtering rate of deep-water pumping are considered to be a possible cause of the low zooplankton abundance and biomass in the pumped-up deep-ocean water. For the zooplankton samples from pumped-up deep-ocean water, there was a high abundance of benthopelagic mysids and copepods (Xanthocalanus spp.). Because the water inlet of the deep-ocean water pumping is located near the sea bottom, the collected samples may be useful for the evaluation of seasonal changes in the population structure of the less-studied benthopelagic species.

Social capital as an ecosystem service: Evidence from a locally managed marine area,"Barnes-Mauthe, M; Oleson, KLL; Brander, LM; Zafindrasilivonona, B; Oliver, TA; van Beukering, P","Social capital is an important ecosystem service, yet we lack common understanding of how it fits, and can be operationalized, within the ecosystem services framework. We review the literature to clarify the role of social capital in this context, establishing it as a multidimensional concept and a fundamental constituent of human well-being that is both supported by, and affects, all categories of ecosystem services. We then draw on qualitative and quantitative data to assess and value social capital as an ecosystem service and explore its role in facilitating management goals in a Malagasy locally managed marine area. We find high levels of social capital, gauged by trust, community involvement, and social cohesion. Results of a choice experiment show positive utilities associated with high levels of social cohesion. Respondents also ranked social cohesion higher than some provisioning, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services. Qualitative data suggest social capital increased as a result of the community based management institution, and has facilitated the success of marine management measures. Our results offer insight into the ways in which social capital can both affect, and be affected by, the management of natural resources, and how it can be assessed and valued as an ecosystem service.

Contextualising the coupled socio-ecological conditions of marine megafauna bycatch,"Teh, LSL; Teh, LCL; Hines, E; Junchompoo, C; Lewison, RL","We apply an integrated and interdisciplinary conceptual framework to assess the potential for uptake of bycatch reduction measures by small-scale fisheries along the Andaman coast and eastern Gulf of Thailand, and in Sabah, Malaysia. Specifically, we characterize the current governance, socio-economic, ecological, and scientific context for marine megafauna bycatch, and identify the enabling and limiting factors to bycatch reduction at each location. Enabling factors are those that motivate or facilitate conservation actions among resource users, managers, and other stakeholders, while limiting factors are those that act as barriers to conservation. We conduct a comparative analysis of the strength of enabling and limiting factors at the two study locations by using a qualitative scoring system. Overall, conditions in Thailand appear to be relatively more supportive of bycatch reduction than Sabah. Many enabling factors, such as community based marine management and positive attitudes towards conservation, occur at the local scale, suggesting potential marine megafauna bycatch reduction approaches can be implemented successfully from the bottom-up. We show that intervention points for reducing marine megafauna bycatch lie within a much broader realm than conventionally considered in bycatch reduction schemes. Effective policies for reducing marine megafauna bycatch thus have to address multifaceted drivers of small-scale fishing behaviour in addition to ecological considerations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Applicability of ecological assessment tools for management decision-making: A case study from the Lima estuary (NW Portugal),"Azevedoa, I; Ramos, S; Mucha, AP; Bordalo, AA","The Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims to achieve and conserve a good ecological status of all surface waters, including estuarine environments, which should be assessed considering several biological elements, together with physical, chemical and pollution elements.In this study, we investigated the applicability of ecological indicators for a practical management issue: selection of the most suitable location for a marina in a salt-marsh temperate estuary (River Lima, NW Portugal). Considering the WFD principles, we assumed that the most suitable location for the implementation of a marina should be the one with the least ecological value, considering that it could be an opportunity for ecological rehabilitation. In order to attain this purpose, the ecological quality status of five potential locations in the navigable lower stretch of the Lima estuary was assessed following an ecosystem-based approach. Several key ecological quality elements such as physical and chemical parameters of water and sediment, phytoplankton biomass, as well as macroinvertebrate and fish communities were surveyed. In addition, heavy-metal analyses, fecal indicator evaluation and ""first-screening"" toxicity tests were also performed. All. collected information was integrated using a scaled value approach, in order to rank the five locations. Furthermore, for the assessment of the ecological quality status of the potential sites, a macroinvertebrate (M-AMBI) and a demersal community based (EDI-Estuarine Demersal Indicators) indices were used. Different human pressures were detected, being the uppermost site more susceptible to urban wastewater discharge, whereas the location downstream the commercial seaport was more prone to accumulate contaminants in the sediments. The scaled values approach allowed the ranking of the potential sites, where the uppermost location ranked last M-AMBI and EDI also classified that location with the lower ecological quality status. Both biological indices were in agreement concerning the discrimination of the location with the lowest ecological quality status, which coincided with the one ranked last by the scaled values approach. The selected biological indices proved to be useful tools for decision-making support in an environmental management context. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Envisioning ocean governability transformations through network-based marine spatial planning,"Gerhardinger, LC; Holzkamper, E; de Andrade, MM; Correa, MR; Turra, A","The globally accelerating environmental crisis calls for radical changes in the governance of ocean resources towards a more sustainable and socially equitable world. Transdisciplinary sustainability research and networked knowledge-to-action approaches are critical parts of this change. The effective application of such approaches still puzzles social actors (individuals and networks) willing to act in more transformative ways. We conducted twelve participatory network mapping activities to assess the perception of high-level federal government institutional entrepreneurs on the structure and dynamics of an emerging socio-political arena for marine spatial planning (MSP) in Brazil. Our informants, mostly cognizant of their own intra-governmental structures, anticipate the MSP arena to remain self-enclosed, with changes only occurring within the federal government structures in the coming years. Their perceptions were largely conservative, narrow, and unambitious and therefore unfit to generate regime transformations. The limited awareness of response capacities beyond the federal government potentially leads to the endurement of the low performance already present in the MSP arena. Results from the participatory network mapping informed a five-step functional ocean governability analysis pointing to key potential contributions to support a critical turn in MSP: 1. envision situated interactional narratives to leverage regime shifts; 2. build a shared understanding of and anticipating transformative coevolutionary dynamics; 3. build awareness of the potential synergies among disparate but innovative area-based responses; 4. specify inter-network-based limitations and the necessary changes underpinning potential leaps in performance levels of ocean governance orders; 5. make power asymmetries explicit to stir structurally tailored strategic action by less influential groups.

Recommendations for the management of subsistence fisheries in South Africa,"Harris, JM; Branch, GM; Clark, BM; Cockcroft, AC; Coetzee, C; Dye, AH; Hauck, M; Johnson, A; Kati-Kati, L; Maseko, Z; Salo, K; Sauer, WHH; Siqwana-Ndulo, N; Sowman, M","This paper summarizes recommendations for the management of previously marginalized and neglected subsistence fisheries in South Africa. The recommendations stem from the activities and analyses of a task group appointed by Government and mandated to provide advice about management of the new fishing sector. The following focus areas were identified for attention: planning for implementation; definitions of subsistence fishers and other sectors; assessment and categorization of resources; determination of types of fishing activities; zonation; management systems; training; communication mechanisms; application and allocation procedures; compliance processes; research and monitoring; development of institutional capacity. Subsistence fishers were defined as poor people who personally harvest marine resources as a source of food or to sell them to meet basic needs of food security; they operate on or near to the shore or in estuaries, live in close proximity to the resource, consume or sell the resources locally, use low-technology gear (often as part of a long-standing community-based or cultural practice), and the resources they harvest generate only sufficient returns to meet basic needs of food security. A second group of informal fishers was identified that fishes for profit but cannot be equated to large industrial fisheries, and a new sector was proposed to accommodate these artisanal ""small-scale commercial"" fishers. Resources were classified for use by these different sectors based on accessibility, fishing methods, cash value and sustainability. In all, 12 different categories of subsistence and small-scale commercial 'fisheries were identified, and a preliminary list of resource species suitable for different fishing sectors is presented. A multi-tiered institutional management structure is recommended, with the national agency (MCM) controlling issues of national concern, and supporting and coordinating the activities of provincial and local structures. The management agents required for effective implementation were identified and include a dedicated national Subsistence Fisheries Management Unit, provincial management agencies that have the capacity to be delegated authority, Regional Fieldworkers, an independent Advisory Group for Subsistence Fisheries Management, local co-management structures, and community monitors responsible for observing and recording fishing activities and catches.

Developing a performance evaluation mechanism for Portuguese marine spatial planning using a participatory approach,"Ferreira, MA; Johnson, D; da Silva, CP; Ramos, TB","Ocean governance frameworks are aimed at achieving sustainable use of the marine environment and its finite resources. They are increasingly being developed and implemented worldwide. Although the importance of evaluating the success of integrated ocean management initiatives is widely recognized, so is its complexity, and there is still limited knowledge or empirical experience on how to actually carry out such an evaluation. This research aims to develop a framework to evaluate the performance of marine spatial planning (MSP) (focusing on the tangible outcomes of such initiatives). Portugal's maritime area totals c. 3,800,000 km(2). As one of the world's largest maritime nations, and with its ocean governance framework finalised in 2015, Portugal emerges as a relevant case study for the development of a mechanism to evaluate performance of its MSP system. A step-by-step participatory approach was designed to develop a set of indicators that could constitute the core of an evaluation mechanism of the performance of the Portuguese MSP system. The resulting fifteen indicators cover all aspects of an IPOO framework (inputs, process, outputs, outcomes) relevant in an MSP context (data and information base, transparency, aspects related to conflict, and to economic activities such as levels of investment and jobs), while including contextual indicators related to the state of the marine environment. These indicators thus simultaneously allow an assessment of the economic, social, and environmental effects of MSP, including some integrative high-level indicators such as well-being. This research demonstrates the interest and usefulness of using a participatory approach to the development of a comprehensive performance evaluation mechanism of Portuguese MSP. It exemplifies a shift towards a new, participatory, approach to the monitoring and evaluation stages of the MSP cycle, which may constitute a useful tool in the emerging field of MSP evaluation in Europe and beyond.

The Marine Extractive Reserves are the materialization of a community-based protected area model through a system of co-management where natural resources are managed pursuing its sustainable use. However, the model transferred to the coastal and marine environment finds conflicts of legal order, given the current Brazilian legislation. The conflict is due to the denial of access to resources in the areas demarcated as a reserve by citizens not designated as ""traditional population"". This access restriction does not find basis in Brazilian law, which can generate conflicts between beneficiaries and ""excluded."" Extractive Reserves are areas where the culture and values of traditional population should be preserved concurrently with the sustainable use of natural resources. But until today, there is no long-term studies that prove empirically whether the resources used are being managed in order to perpetuate themselves, considering their use by communities. Biological and anthropogenic factors must be constantly monitored in order to separate the fluctuations capture of natural order from the ones cause by human beings.

Effects of hydrodynamics on the distribution of trace persistent organic pollutants and macrobenthic communities in Bohai Bay,"Zheng, BH; Zhao, XR; Liu, LS; Li, ZC; Lei, K; Zhang, L; Qin, YW; Gan, ZF; Gao, SZ; Jiao, LX","In recent years, the rapid economic development along Bohai Bay, has brought out continuous increasing of the pollution loads in the Bohai Sea, especially by the large coastal reclamation project, Tianjin Binhai New Area. In the period of 2007-2009, we collected the sediments of the main rivers, estuaries, intertidal zone, and near-shore area of Bohai Bay, and Macrobenthos associated with the marine sediments to assess the influence of hydrodynamics in the coastal environment on the pattern of trace contaminants and the macrobenthic community. Based on data derived from these samples, the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in sediments followed the order PAHs > OCPs > PCBs > PBDEs. The higher concentrations of PCBs, OCPs, PAHs and PBDEs were found in the estuarine and near-shore environment of the Dagu Drainage River. The spatial distribution of OCPs was different to that of PCBs due to the direction of the velocity field of Bohai Bay in its old and new topography, and the higher water-solubility of OCPs than that of PCBs. The results of the Pearson correlation and the PCA indicate that the medium diameter (MD) of sediments was the predominant factor influencing the distribution of PCBs and OCPs, most sampling sites were characterized mainly by TOC of sediments and biomass of macrobenthos. The results indicate that the distribution of trace contaminants and macrobenthic community in Bohai Bay are mainly affected by the hydrodynamic conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

An approach to analysis of functional redundancy in protozoan communities for bioassessment in marine ecosystems,"Xu, GJ; Xu, HL","It is necessary to detect how much ecological redundancy or response units (RUs) exist in communities for reducing the ""signal-to-noise"" ratios of the observed full species data in community-based ecological research and monitoring programs. To reveal the functional redundancy in ciliated protozoan communities in marine ecosystems for both ecological research and monitoring programs, a multivariate approach (peeling procedure) was used to identify the response units to the environmental changes using a dataset of biofilm-dwelling ciliates from coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, northern China. From the full 141-species dataset, three subsets with sufficient information of the whole community (correlation coefficient >0.75) were identified as response units (RUs 1-3) at three levels of functional redundancy, which comprised 20, 26 and 27 species, respectively. These response units appeared to be interchangeable between functional equivalents on both spatial and temporal scales. In terms of relative abundance, RU1, which predominated the ciliate communities over 1-year period, and RU2, which occurred only in warm seasons (except winter) with a peak in summer, presented a decreasing trend, while RU3, which distributed all four seasons with two peaks in summer and autumn, increased with the increase of pollution level. Furthermore, high proportions of bacterivores were found in RU1 during warm seasons and represented an increase trend, while high relative abundances of algivores occurred in RUs 2 and 3 appeared to be decreasing along the pollution gradient. These results demonstrated that the ciliated protozoan assemblages have high functional redundancy in response to environmental changes in marine ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Watershed restoration as a tool for improving coral reef resilience against climate change and other human impacts,"Shelton, AJ; Richmond, RH","Environmental stressors in coastal areas threaten the sustainability of marine resources and reduce their resilience to climate change impacts. Accelerated land erosion is a major stressor that leads to increased turbidity and sedimentation on downstream coral reefs and the degradation of ecosystem functions. Volunteers from a community-based initiative in Guam installed 130 tree seedlings and 54 m of sediment filter socks in eroding hillsides above Fouha Bay, to reduce erosion. A soil probing method for measuring soil depth was developed and used to evaluate the effectiveness of the watershed restoration tools. The trees and socks trapped 111.8 tons of sediment on land after 21 months. In heavily eroding portions of the restoration plot, where socks and trees were used in combination, the mean sediment trapping efficiency was 44 kg m(-2) yr(-1). Previous studies indicate a 75% reduction in sedimentation rate is required to bring Fouha Bay below severe-catastrophic sedimentation stress (>50 mg cm(-2) day(-1)). Based on the observed sediment trapping efficiency of restoration tools in this study, an estimated 0.05 km(2) of severely eroding hillsides must be treated with 19 km of socks and 11,000 trees to trap 2121 tons of sediment and achieve the necessary reduction. If sediment input into the bay is controlled, existing sediment will clear out with storm-driven swells. As shown in other high islands, coral reefs are resilient and can recover after sedimentation stress is reduced. Data generated on the efficiency of watershed restoration tools in this study can be used in watershed management plans to promote the sustainability and resilience of coastal areas in other tropical islands.

The present status of artisanal fisheries of extreme Southern Brazil: an effort towards community-based management,"Reis, EG; D'Incao, F","The continental shelf of the extreme southern Brazil is one of the most productive fishing areas in Brazil. Great part of the commercial species is related to the estuary of Patos Lagoon. The estuary serves as spawning, nursery and feeding grounds for several species. The artisanal fishery in the estuarine area exists since the end of the last century but from 1982 onwards, catches have declined sharply. Nowadays, the estuarine fishery does not exist as an economic activity, except for pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus paulensis) and mullet (Mugil platanus). The artisanal fishery involves about 3500 fishermen. Fisheries management in the Patos Lagoon and coastal area has been traditionally done in a top-down process: government decides and acts unilaterally. As a consequence, regulations exist only officially. In 1996 the Forum of Patos Lagoon, a multi-partner entity that includes political, economical and legal institutions, was established. This is the first initiative of the community to become part of the organization and regulation process of the fisheries in the area. The Forum activities initiatives range from evaluation of the present practices of fisheries management and enforcement, encouragement of co-operative and associated initiatives; to planning and development of activities that may lead to the possible recovery of the productive capacity of the Patos Lagoon. A new regulation for the area was produced considering, for the first time, the interest of the community. Although this represents a major step on fisheries management in the area, it resents the lack of a specific management for fisheries that exploit the same stocks in marine waters. The lack of a clear policy for the fishery sector in Brazil represents a major setback to achieve proposed goals in management. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The Adjacency Doctrine in the Negotiation of BBNJ: Creeping Jurisdiction or Legitimate Claim?,"Su, JY","Adjacency, notwithstanding its status as a basis for generating maritime entitlements, has no place as a principle under the existing law of the sea. To endow it with such status in the negotiation of an agreement for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) is likely to upset the delicate balance between the rights of coastal states and those of the international community, which is essential to the widespread acceptance of United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This article argues that the access regime for marine genetic resources (MGRs) straddling the boundary between areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) and areas within national jurisdiction (AWNJ) should be location based, and adjacent coastal states should not be accorded preferential rights in the distribution of benefits. However, due regard should be paid to the rights and legitimate interests of adjacent coastal states when transboundary impacts may result from measures adopted for and activities conducted in ABNJ, including those that directly affect MGRs straddling the boundary between ABNJ and AWNJ. At the procedural level, coastal states should be allowed to participate, primarily through prior notification and consultation, in the adoption of area-based management tools (ABMTs) in ABNJ and the conduct of environmental impact assessment (EIA) with respect to activities therein.",2021,,OCEAN DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL LAW,52,1,41-63,WOS:000622257500001,10.1080/00908320.2020.1852841,,#19766,Su 2021,,
Social networks and transitions to co-management in Jamaican marine reserves and small-scale fisheries,"Alexander, SM; Armitage, D; Charles, A","How social networks support or constrain the transition to co-management of small-scale fisheries and marine reserves is poorly understood. In this paper, we undertake a comparative analysis of the social network structures associated with the transition to co-management in three Jamaican marine reserves. Data from quantitative social relational surveys (n = 380) are integrated with data from semi-structured interviews (n = 63) and focus groups (n = 10) to assess how patterns of relational ties and interactions between and among fishermen and other local level actors (e.g., managers, wardens, NGO staff) support and constrain the transition to co-management. Our research suggests that the transitions to co-management were supported by a combination of three network structure and relational attributes: (i) the presence and position of institutional entrepreneurs; (ii) a dense central core of network actors; and (iii) the prevalence of horizontal ties and vertical linkages held by the community-based organizations formally responsible for the management of the marine reserves. Our findings also show that overall low network cohesion in the three reserves and limited social influence among the wardens may be problematic for sustained collective action that extends beyond the core set of network actors. These findings suggest the importance of strategies to enhance collective action, specifically through attention to the attributes of the corresponding social networks, as a means to contribute to successful transitions to co-management of marine reserves and small-scale fisheries. Our results provide more precise guidance, through social network analysis, on where in the respective networks social capital and leadership may require support or enhancement, and thus on how to target interventions for greatest effect.

"Gear-based characterization of the Gizo, Solomon Islands, inshore commercial finfish fishery","Rhodes, KL; Tua, P; Sulu, R; Pitakaka, P; Kekete, P; Uti, M; Funu, F; Masu, R","In 2015-2016, a gear-specific assessment of the Gizo, Solomon Islands, commercial inshore fishery was conducted to assist management decision making. The survey identified at least 260 species and 25 families among over 14,000 individual catch- and gear-specific fish photos taken using a digital image capture system. Seventy-nine fishers provided 175 catches during surveys and more than 1,600 fisher and vendor interviews were conducted. More than 75% of all individual fish sampled belonged to nine families that included groupers (Epinephelidae) with 29 species and snappers (Lutjanidae) with 28 species. Groupers, snappers and emperors (Lethrinidae) dominated line-caught fish, while speared catch was composed primarily of parrotfish (Scaridae) and surgeonfish and unicornfish (Acanthuridae). Catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) was 3.9 +/- 0.1 kg hr(-1) fisher(-1) overall, with the highest CPUE for line fishing at 4.5 +/- 1.6 kg hr(-1) and lowest CPUE for nighttime spearfishing (2.1 +/- 0.4 kg hr(-1)). Gear-specific size distributions and species targeted varied widely, with juveniles dominating most catches for speared fish. Between line-caught and speared catch, only two species were common within the top 25 species. At the time of the study there were no enacted national regulations related to finfish in the inshore fishery in Solomon Islands. Community-based management approaches have been endorsed by government and non-government entities in Solomon Islands, however a greater level of community engagement and voluntary fisher compliance is needed in concert with government enforcement to control potential overfishing, particularly nighttime spearfishing. Ongoing support for precautionary, adaptive management is a recommended course of action to limit the potential for overfishing in Gizo and other coastal areas of high human population density that rely heavily on marine resources.

Anthropogenic influence on the environmental health along Montenegro coast based on the bacterial and chemical characterization,"Jokanovic, S; Kajan, K; Perovic, S; Ivanic, M; Macic, V; Orlic, S","Coastal marine sediments are particularly exposed to human activities. The function of a coastal ecosystem is largely affected by eutrophication, wastewater discharges, chemical pollution, port activities, industry and tourism. Bacterial classification can be used as a measure in assessing the harmful effects on the ecosystem. This study provided insight into the environmental health of the coastal region of Montenegro analyzing the possible impact of PAHs and PCBs upon the bacterial community diversity and function as well as nutrients. Two stations at the shipyards were defined as very high PAH polluted together with PCB concentration exceeding threshold values. The bacterial community at the OTU level clustered together all stations except the most polluted site (SBL), the main tourist destination in Montenegro (BDV) and the estuary site (ADB) forming the independent clusters. Bacterial community based on the OTU level was driven by PAHs, TOC and silt content. The lowest richness and diversity were indicated at the site with the highest concentration of PAHs and PCBs with the highest abundance of Alphaproteobacteria followed by Gammaproteobacteria. OTUs affiliated to phyla BRC1, Dadabacteria and Spirochaetes were present with a total abundance higher than 1% only at the most polluted site indicating their persistence and possible potential for degradation of aromatic compounds. To compare functional capabilities potentially related to biodegradation of aromatic compounds and active transport systems, PICRUSt was used to predict metagenomes of the sediments. From our data, we identified specific bacterial community and predicted metabolic pathways that give us a picture of the environmental health along the coast of Montenegro, which provides us a new insight into human-induced pollution impacts on the coastal ecosystem.

Source attribution and quantification of benzene event emissions in a Houston ship channel community based on real-time mobile monitoring of ambient air,"Olaguer, EP; Erickson, MH; Wijesinghe, A; Neish, BS","A mobile laboratory equipped with a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) operated in Galena Park, Texas, near the Houston Ship Channel during the Benzene and other Toxics Exposure Study (BEE-TEX). The mobile laboratory measured transient peaks of benzene of up to 37 ppbv in the afternoon and evening of February 19, 2015. Plume reconstruction and source attribution were performed using the four-dimensional (4D) variational data assimilation technique and a threedimensional (3D) micro-scale forward and adjoint air quality model based on mobile PTR-MS data and nearby stationary wind measurements at the Galena Park Continuous Air Monitoring Station (CAMS). The results of inverse modeling indicate that significant pipeline emissions of benzene may at least partly explain the ambient concentration peaks observed in Galena Park during BEE-TEX. Total pipeline emissions of benzene inferred within the 16-km(2) model domain exceeded point source emissions by roughly a factor of 2 during the observational episode. Besides pipeline leaks, the model also inferred significant benzene emissions from marine, railcar, and tank truck loading/unloading facilities, consistent with the presence of a tanker and barges in the Kinder Morgan port terminal during the afternoon and evening of February 19. Total domain emissions of benzene exceeded corresponding 2011 National Emissions Inventory (NEI) estimates by a factor of 2-6.Implications: Port operations involving petrochemicals may significantly increase emissions of air toxics from the transfer and storage of materials. Pipeline leaks, in particular, can lead to sporadic emissions greater than in emission inventories, resulting in higher ambient concentrations than are sampled by the existing monitoring network. The use of updated methods for ambient monitoring and source attribution in real time should be encouraged as an alternative to expanding the conventional monitoring network.",2016,,JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION,66,2,164-172,WOS:000371093100006,10.1080/10962247.2015.1081652,,#19770,Olaguer 2016,,
Designing effective reserve networks for nonequilibrium metacommunities,"Gouhier, TC; Guichard, F; Menge, BA","The proliferation of efficient fishing practices has promoted the depletion of commercial stocks around the world and caused significant collateral damage to marine habitats. Recent empirical studies have shown that marine reserves can play an important role in reversing these effects. Equilibrium metapopulation models predict that networks of marine reserves can provide similar benefits so long as individual reserves are sufficiently large to achieve self-sustainability, or spaced based on the extent of dispersal of the target species in order to maintain connectivity between neighboring reserves. However, these guidelines have not been tested in nonequilibrium metacommunity models that exhibit the kinds of complex spatiotemporal dynamics typically seen in natural marine communities. Here, we used a spatially explicit predator-prey model whose predictions have been validated in a marine system to show that current guidelines are not optimal for metacommunities. In equilibrium metacommunities, there is a community-level trade-off for designing effective reserves: Networks whose size and spacing are smaller than the extent of dispersal maximize global predator abundance but minimize global prey abundance because of trophic cascades, whereas the converse is true for reserve networks whose size and spacing are larger than the extent of dispersal. In nonequilibrium metacommunities, reserves whose size and spacing match the extent of spatial autocorrelation in adult abundance (i.e., the extent of patchiness) escape this community-level trade-off by maximizing global abundance and persistence of both the prey and the predator. Overall, these results suggest that using the extent of adult patchiness instead of the extent of larval dispersal as the size and spacing of reserve networks is critical for designing community-based management strategies. By emphasizing patchiness over dispersal distance, our results show how the apparent complexity of nonequilibrium communities can actually simplify management guidelines and reduce uncertainty associated with the assessment of dispersal in marine environments.",2013,,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,23,6,1488-1503,WOS:000323935700021,10.1890/12-1801.1,,#19771,Gouhier 2013,,
"Fishery trends, resource-use and management system in the Ungwana Bay fishery Kenya","Fulanda, B; Ohtomi, J; Mueni, E; Kimani, E","The present study assessed trends in resource-use, partitioning and management in the Ungwana Bay fishery, Kenya, using surplus production models. The fishery is one of East Africa's important marine fisheries sustaining a bottom trawl commercial fishery and a resident-migrant artisanal fishery. Two models: Schaefer (1954) and Gulland and Fox (1975) were applied to catch-effort data over a 21-year period to model maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and optimal effort (f(MSY)) to examine the status of resource exploitation and provide reference points for sustainable management. In the artisanal fishery, model MSYs range from 392-446 t to 1283-1473 t for shrimps and fish respectively compared to mean annual landings of 60 t for shrimp and 758 t for fish. These landings represent <50% of the model MSYs suggesting under exploitation in the sub-sector. Moreover, current fishing effort applied stands at <0.5 f(MSY). On the other hand, mean annual landings in bottom trawl commercial fishery, at about 330 t for shrimps and 583 t and fish represent about 90% of the model MSYs of 352-391 t and 499-602 t for shrimps and fish respectively. Therefore, the bottom trawl commercial fishery is likely under full exploitation. Similarly, the current effort is estimated at >0.7 f(MSY). Resource management in the bay is faced with numerous problems including resource-use conflicts, poor economic conditions in artisanal fishery, poor legislation, and inadequate research augmented by poor reporting systems for catch-effort statistics. Thus, the fishery lacks clearly defined exploitation regimes. Fisheries research and assessment of the marine resources are important for sustainability of the fishery. Moreover, income diversification in the poverty ridden artisanal fishery would go a long way in addressing resource-use conflicts and use of deleterious fishing methods in the sub-sector. Borrowing from the successes of the Japanese community-based fisheries resource management (CBFRM) which has easily resolved numerous fisheries management issues in coastal small-scale commercial fisheries, and the beach management unit (BMU) system which has been applied to the artisanal fisheries of south coast Kenya with enormous benefits, it is envisaged that a hybrid CBFRM BMU system presents the best approach to sustainable resource-use in the Ungwana Bay fishery.

"The academic, career and personal benefits of zoological internships: A 10-year evaluation of a dolphin research internship","Matrai, E; Kwok, ST; Grainger, D; Boos, M; Pogany, A","/nternship programmes have grown in popularity in many academic fields, including marine mammal science. These programmes provide invaluable opportunities for early-career scientists to obtain practical and hands-on experience with a rare insight into the day-to-day operation of a research team. Working in the field of marine mammal science requires a wide range of skills, many of which can only be acquired with first-hand practical experience. The current study evaluated the academic, employment and personal impacts on participants of an ex-situ research internship programme at Hong Kong's Ocean Park over the past 10 years. The survey included 175 evaluations submitted by interns that joined and successfully completed the programme between September 2010 and December 2020. The programme received positive evaluations on all three assessed aspects and was rated 'above expectation' by 67% of the respondents. The participants indicated that they gained both transferable and research -specific skills. Benefits of the experience were reported in regard to academic trajectory (91%), personal life (98%) and employment (91%). Based on experience and the feedback from the participants, an improved set of best practice recommendations is provided.

Monitoring captive odontocetes' participation during training sessions for improving training efficiency and welfare evaluation,"Serres, A; Hao, YJ; Wang, D","In captive facilities, odontocetes are subject to daily training/feeding sessions which often create close relationships between animals and their caretakers. Therefore, such sessions are thought to provide information that can be useful for welfare assessment. Recent studies on bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) validated caretakers' ratings of dolphins' participation during training sessions as a welfare indicator. Even though their behavior, adaptation to captive settings or relationship with humans may differ from bottlenose dolphins, many other odontocete species remain much less studied. In the present study, animals from three groups including Yangtze finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis), East-Asian finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis sunameri), and bottlenose dolphins were monitored during training sessions. Four variables were recorded: a participation score rated by caretakers, the leaving rate, the amount of food eaten, and the propensity to finish the attributed food. Bottlenose dolphins participated better in sessions: they were attributed higher participation scores, departed less and finished their food more often than finless porpoises. The context of the sessions, including time of the day, season, type of session, social grouping, occurrence of unusual events or presence of visitors affected the parameters recorded during sessions in the three groups. The inter-species differences and the context-related variations of the four measured parameters should be used to adapt the schedules and techniques of training sessions for each group. Such adaptation could improve training effectiveness and the human-animal relationship. In addition, the associations among the four measured parameters and between these parameters and the animals' displayed activity revealed the most informative parameter for each group: participation score for Yangtze finless porpoises, food intake for East-Asian finless porpoises and leaving rate for bottlenose dolphins. These parameters best reflect the motivation of the animals during sessions, and may therefore be beneficial to integrate into welfare monitoring tools. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Modeling Whale Deaths From Vessel Strikes to Reduce the Risk of Fatality to Endangered Whales,"Rockwood, RC; Adams, JD; Hastings, S; Morten, J; Jahncke, J","Vessel strikes have been documented around the world and frequently figure as a top human cause of large whale mortality. The shipping lanes in the Santa Barbara Channel, California and nearby waters have some of the highest predicted whale mortality from vessel strikes in the United States waters of the eastern Pacific. Beginning in 2007, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration requested voluntary vessel speed reductions (VSRs) for vessels greater than 300 GT traveling in the Santa Barbara Channel shipping routes to decrease whale mortality from ship strikes. We employed a ship strike model using whale density data and automatic identification system (AIS) vessel data to estimate mortality under several management scenarios. To assess the effect of the VSR on strike mortality, we bootstrapped speeds from vessels greater than 19 m long that transited when no VSR was in place. Finally, we calculated the predicted mortality for hypothetical cooperation scenarios by artificially adding speed caps post-hoc to real vessel transits. For 2012-2018, we estimated that in our study area on average during summer/fall (June-November) 8.9 blue, 4.6 humpback, and 9.7 fin whales were killed from ship strikes each year (13-26% greater than previously estimated). We evaluated winter/spring (January-April) humpback mortality for the first time, resulting in an estimate of 5.7 deaths on average per year. Poor cooperation with the VSR led to low (5% maximum) to no reductions in the estimated number of strike mortalities. Evaluating potential scenarios showed that if 95% cooperation occurred in the lanes, whale deaths there would decrease by 22-26%. Adding VSRs with similar cooperation levels at the northern end of the Santa Barbara Channel and south of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary could decrease estimated strike mortalities in those areas by 30%. If VSRs were added and cooperation reached 95% there and in the lanes, we estimate a 21-29% decrease in vessel strike mortalities could be attained relative to estimated mortality in the entire study area. To decrease the vessel strike related whale mortalities in this region, we recommend expanding the VSR areas and increasing cooperation voluntarily, or considering mandatory speed limits if desired cooperation levels cannot otherwise be met.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000684306000001,10.3389/fmars.2021.649890,,#19776,Rockwood 2021,,
"Monitoring Changes in Vegetation Cover of Bhitarkanika Marine National Park Region, Odisha, India Using Vegetation Indices of Multidate Satellite Data","Thakur, RR; Kumar, P; Palria, S","The coast of Odisha extends from Balasore in the north to Ganjam in the south spreading 480 km. It exhibits a depositional terrain formed by the action of fluvio-marine, lacustrine, estuarine and aeolian agents. The river system coupled with marine action help in generating diversified physiographic and dynamic coastal features. Over the period, the coastal tract also witnesses the vagary of nature. Vast alluvial plain, meandering pattern of rivers, low lying swamps and swamp forests, sand dunes, beach ridges, beaches and swales are typical landforms associated with the coastal tract. The Bhitarkanika Marine National Park region, the study area is situated on the northern part of the coast which mostly exhibit swampy habitat due to large fine clastic deposits by riverine action. Mangroves on the swampy region occupy around 18,348 ha and regarded as the second largest mangrove formation in the subcontinent. Besides, the coastal tract also exhibits a congenial place for mass nesting of sea turtles coming from Pacific Ocean. The study area is now under stress due to various natural as well as anthropogenic pressure. The degradation of mangroves is mainly due to human encroachment and reclamation of land for aquaculture practices. It is observed that the occurrence of vegetation cover decreases continuously from 1973 to 2017. Dense vegetation cover is recorded as 35.23 % (1973) which decreased to 22.43 % (2017). On the southern end of the study area lies an all-weather port named Paradeep and on the northern side one emerging new port called Dhamra port. Their activities and impact as well as blooming aquaculture practices have bearing on the ecosystem of the mangroves. The assessment of vegetation vigor of the region portrays the condition of the environment shaped after years of degradation activities due to natural as well as anthropogenic activities induced from 595 villages having 50,6930 population.The objective of the study is to analyze the changes of vegetation vigor using NDVI from multi date satellite data and record the changes for better monitoring of the area. It may be inferred that the existing conservation measures and protection plans are inadequate to hold the coastal natural resources intact.

A comparative review and analysis of tentative ecological quality objectives (EcoQOs) for protection of marine environments in Korea and China,"Khim, JS; Hong, S; Yoon, SJ; Nam, J; Ryu, J; Kang, SG","Ecological quality objectives (EcoQOs), as tools for implementing ecosystem approach, have long been acknowledged to protect the marine ecosystems and fisheries in regional seas through joint efforts by surrounding countries over the past decade. The present review analyzed the best available meta-data relating to the five ecosystem elements that were recently proposed by the Northwest Pacific Action Plan to evaluate the current status of coastal ecosystem health in marine environment of the Yellow Sea. We suggested the six tentative EcoQOs among five ecological quality elements including: 1) biological and habitat diversity; 2) invasive species; 3) eutrophication; 4) pollutants; and 5) marine litters. Environmental status was assessed, depending on the EcoQOs targets, by comparison to the world average values, existing environmental standards, or reported values of other regional seas. Results of analysis revealed that among the six tentative EcoQOs, two target objectives to marine biodiversity and concentrations of nutrients (viz., DIN and DIP) were met towards good environmental status. Whilst, three EcoQOs relating to hypoxia and red-tide, pollutants (persistent toxic substances and metals), and marine litters (including microplastics) did not meet and one relating to invasive species could not be judged due to insufficient data sets. The biggest weak point for developing suitable EcoQOs and assessing status of ecosystem health could be insufficient meta-data sets available and/or discrepancy in methodological details cross the data-sets or between the two targeted countries. Thus, the cooperation of neighboring countries, viz., Korea and China for the Yellow Sea, is necessary for the ecosystem based management of our regional sea in the future. Overall, this first time review for the assessment of target tentative EcoQOs in the Yellow Sea region encompassing coasts of Korea and China would provide a better understanding of the current status of environmental pollution and ecosystem health.

We evaluated long-term trends (1990-2015) for bulk deposition, throughfall and runoff water chemistry and fluxes, and climatic variables 10 25 forested catchments in Europe belonging to the UNECE International Cooperative Programme on Integrated Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Ecosystems (ICP IM). Many of the IM sites form part of the monitoring infrastructures of this larger ILTER network. Trends were evaluated for monthly concentrations of non-marine (anthropogenic fraction, denoted as x) sulphate (xSO(4)) and base cations x(Ca + Mg), hydrogen ion (H+), inorganic N (NO3 and NH4) and ANC (Acid Neutralising Capacity) and their respective fluxes into and out of the catchments and for monthly precipitation, runoff and air temperature. A significant decrease of xSO(4) deposition resulted in decreases in concentrations and fluxes of xSO(4) in runoff, being significant at 90% and 60% of the sites, respectively. Bulk deposition of NO3 and NH4 decreased significantly at 60-80% (concentrations) and 40-60% (fluxes) of the sites. Concentrations and fluxes of NO3 in runoff decreased at 73% and 63% of the sites, respectively, and NO3 concentrations decreased significantly at 50% of the sites. Thus, the LTER/ICP IM network confirms the positive effects of the emission reductions in Europe. Air temperature increased significantly at 61% of the sites, while trends for precipitation and runoff were rarely significant. The site specific variation of xSO(4) concentrations in runoff was most strongly explained by deposition. Climatic variables and deposition explained the variation of inorganic N concentrations in runoff at single sites poorly, and as yet there are no clear signs of a consistent deposition-driven or climate-driven increase in inorganic N exports in the catchments.

At loggerheads over international bycatch: Initial effects of a unilaterally imposed bycatch reduction policy,"Senko, J; Jenkins, LD; Peckham, SH","The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) is the primacy law that codifies marine fisheries management in United States federal waters. The MSA was amended in 2006 with Section 610, an international provision that directs the Secretary of Commerce to unilaterally identify foreign nations engaged in the incidental capture (bycatch) of protected living marine resources (PLMRs) under specific conditions. In 2013 the United States identified Mexico for bycatch of a PLMR - the North Pacific loggerhead turtle representing the first time a nation has been identified for bycatch under section 610. This paper evaluates the initial effects of the identification on loggerhead bycatch management efforts in Mexico and provides policy recommendations for improving the law and its implementation. In the wake of the unilateral identification, Mexico downplayed and denied the bycatch problem that their agencies had previously accepted and cancelled a bycatch research partnership between their federal fisheries science agency and U.S. researchers. Moreover, fishers invested in bycatch reduction and monitoring programs ceased to participate, jeopardizing their understanding of the problem and their co-development of bycatch solutions. However, the identification and subsequent consultation process ultimately resulted in Mexico implementing federal loggerhead bycatch regulations that are temporarily comparable with relevant U.S. measures. These regulations establish a temporary fisheries reserve (authorized for two years) that includes monitoring of bycatch, a loggerhead bycatch mortality cap, temporal and spatial restrictions on fishing gear and practices, and a closure of all finfish fisheries during the summer of 2016. As a result, turtle bycatch was likely substantially reduced in 2016, but at the cost of artisanal fishers' entire seasonal income. Policy recommendations are made, highlighting the need to: 1) better assess the socioeconomic, political, and environmental consequences associated with using the threat of trade sanctions to compel nations to reduce their bycatch; and 2) facilitate a more consistent consideration of bycatch data across nations such that the current policy does not create a disincentive for other nations to assess or report PLMR bycatch.",2017,,MARINE POLICY,76,,200-209,WOS:000393012200025,10.1016/j.marpol.2016.11.017,,#19781,Senko 2017,,

The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate and complement existing recreational fisheries research, through the analysis of demographic and psychographic angler attributes collected from two independent, shore-based snapshot monitoring surveys conducted on the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coastline of South Africa, in 1994-1996 and 2009-2010. Results show significant changes between the two survey events in the demographics of anglers (including ethnic composition, age distribution, years of fishing experience and employment status) participating in the KZN shore-based linefishery. Traditional management regulations (minimum size limits, daily bag limits and closed seasons), though appearing to have support, have had limited effectiveness, based on the increased levels of admitted non-compliance and poor knowledge of regulations for target species. Anglers in both surveys believed that catches had declined over the years, with overfishing being the most common reason given. The results are discussed in the context of changing management practices in the KZN recreational shore-based linefishery. The implications of changes in fisheries management policies and responsibilities along the KZN coast are highlighted.",2017,,AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE,39,3,327-337,WOS:000417042200009,10.2989/1814232X.2017.1373704,,#19782,Kramer 2017,,
Assessment of fish consumption and mercury exposure among pregnant women in Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago,"Ricketts, P; Basu, N; Fletcher, H; Voutchkov, M; Bassaw, B","Background: Fish is an essential and traditional element in the diet of most Caribbean people. However it also contains methylmercury which can have severe effects on fetal neurodevelopment. The objective of this study was to assess the fish intake of a selected group of pregnant women from Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago and evaluate prenatal mercury exposure, using the placenta as a biomarker.Method: Food frequency questionnaires and placental samples were obtained from participating parturients at the time of delivery at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica (N =100, from November 2012 to March 2013) and the Mt Hope Women's hospital in St Joseph, Trinidad & Tobago (N = 30, in June 2015). The participants were asked to identify the species of fish and the frequency of consumption. Placental samples were analysed for mercury using cold vapour atomic absorption.Results: The fish consumption preferences for pregnant women, varies based on the marine fish catch production of each country. The main fish species that contributed to the highest estimated methyl mercury exposure in Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago were cod and shark, respectively. There was a weak association between maternal fish intake and placental mercury concentrations. The mean placental mercury concentrations in Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago were 0.74 +/- 0.5 mu g/kg and 1.46 +/- 0.6 mu g/kg, wet weight respectively.Conclusion: The results from this study showed an influence of Caribbean fish intake preferences on mercury exposure and thus a recommendation for continuous bio-monitoring for public health purposes.

"Interactions between whale sharks, Rhincodon typus Smith, 1928 (Orectolobiformes, Rhincodontidae), and Brazilian fisheries: The need for effective conservation measures","Barbosa, MLV; Tavares, DC; Siciliano, S; de Moura, JF; Costa-Neto, EM; Motta, FD; Koike, CD","This study reports three interaction events between the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) and fisheries in Brazilian waters. Two events were described as incidental captures in a gillnet fishery on the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro State, in southeastern Brazil. The last event took place at the Royal Charlotte Oceanic Bank (RCOB), in the southern region of Bahia State, where five fishermen filmed their interaction with a juvenile specimen. For one of the incidental captures, the fish was landed and consumed by locals, and for the other, the shark was released. In the RCOB, the fishermen touched the whale shark with their hands, wooden sticks and even rode on it. In addition, 74 interviews were conducted with fishermen from Bahia about sightings and possible interactions with R. typus. According to statements made by the fishermen, although not frequent, the conduct reported for the RCOB occasionally takes place in the region. Evaluating information of this nature is important to support government plans that regulate fishing activities in order to reduce incidental captures and the harassment of whale sharks. Encouraging the participation of fishermen in a collaborative monitoring program for R. typus may be a good way to better understand the threats to the species at a reduced cost, particularly for developing countries, such as Brazil.

Environmental education indicators system for protected areas management,"Zorrilla-Pujana, J; Rossi, S","A new perspective for the management effectiveness of protected areas needs the inclusion of social data for decision-making. In this process, environmental education (EE) plays a key role in catalyzing biological and social issues in the management process, but there are scarce data about this relationship. The objective of this paper is to develop, from an institutional bottom-up perspective, a proposal for a set of EE indicators that is easy to use by practitioners to measure the response of the EE program in relation to the conservation objectives of protected areas management plans. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques, a case study at the National Parks System of Colombia is presented, which is divided in five stages: 1. An EE evaluation survey on a national scale. 2. An interview phase with EE practitioners and NGOs. 3. EE objectives categorization. 4. Systematization process and 5. Focus group to evaluate the proposed set of indicators. A set of 5 EE indicators was developed to fulfill the identified needs: appropriation of information, articulation, participation quality, program implementation and continuity of EE process. We expect that this new approach for EE evaluation will hopefully be adopted in the update of management plans, as an innovative tool that contributes to the effectiveness assessment of protected areas, integrating a more social and participative focus.

Evaluation of a CMIP5 derived dynamical global wind wave climate model ensemble,"Hemer, MA; Trenham, C","Much effort has gone into evaluating the skill of General Circulation Models (GCMs) for 'standard' climate variables such as surface (air and/or sea) temperature, or precipitation. Whether climate model skill to simulate standard variables translates to the performance of dynamical GCM forced wind-wave simulations is yet to be established.We assess an ensemble of historical dynamical wave climate simulations whereby surface winds taken from GCMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) are used to force a spectral wave model. The GCMs used include 8 CMIP5 models and two dynamically downscaled CMIP3 models.The climatological properties of key integrated wave parameters (significant wave height, maximum wave height, mean wave period and direction) are evaluated, using two independent methods, relative to three historical wave hindcast/reanalysis datasets over 13 areas of the global ocean.We identify that high performance of GCMs for 'standard' climate variables does not imply high performance for GCM forced wave simulations. We also identify there is little to no benefit in choosing a higher resolution CMIP5 GCM (with resolution of similar to 1.4 degrees) over a lower resolution GCM (similar to 2.8 degrees) to improve skill of GCM forced dynamical wave simulations. With the conscious push towards developing projections of waves and storm surges to aid assessments of possible climate driven impacts to coastal communities, we stress the need to evaluate the performance of a GCM for the marine meteorological climate independently of the performance of the GCM for the 'standard' climate variables.

Ichthyoplankton sampling design to monitor marine fish populations and communities,"Koslow, JA; Wright, M","The ability to assess, model, predict and manage the impacts of climate change and other anthropogenic stressors on marine ecosystems depends on having adequate ecological time series. Unfortunately the development of ecological time series considerably lags those for the physics and chemistry of the oceans. Ichthyoplankton time series are proposed here to fill this gap in ocean observations. Marine fish species spanning a wide range of families, habitats, feeding guilds, and trophic levels broadcast large numbers of their reproductive products into the open waters. For a limited period, the larvae generally reside in the upper 200 m of the water column, where they may be quantitatively sampled with plankton nets. Larval abundance provides a relative index for adult spawning stock biomass, enabling diverse fish communities to be monitored quantitatively by relatively simple means. Recent analyses of the ichthyoplankton time series extending back to 1951 from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program indicate that non-commercial as well as commercially-exploited taxa have experienced dramatic change in recent decades. The CalCOFI data set is re-sampled here to show that a reduced sampling program one based on a few stations along a single transect (cf > 50 stations along 6 transects for CalCOFI) or one based on a shorter time series can, within limits, obtain similar single-pecies and multivariate patterns of abundance. Ichthyoplankton survey programs may thus provide the basis for a global system of ocean ecological observations in addition to their primary use today for fisheries stock assessment.

Epidemiologic evaluation of multiple alternate microbial water quality monitoring indicators at three California beaches,"Griffith, JF; Weisberg, SB; Arnold, BF; Cao, YP; Schiff, KC; Colford, JM","Introduction: Advances in molecular methods provide new opportunities for directly measuring pathogens or host-associated markers of fecal pollution instead of relying on fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) alone for beach water quality monitoring. Adoption of new indicators depends on identifying relationships between either the presence or concentration of the indicators and illness among swimmers. Here we present results from three epidemiologic studies in which a broad range of bacterial and viral indicators of fecal contamination were measured simultaneously by either culture or molecular methods along with Enterococcus to assess whether they provide better health risk prediction than current microbial indicators of recreational water quality.Methods: We conducted prospective cohort studies at three California beaches - Avalon Bay (Avalon), Doheny State Beach (Doheny), Surfrider State Beach (Malibu) - during the summers of 2007, 2008 and 2009. The studies enrolled 10,785 swimmers across the beaches and recorded each swimmer's water exposure. Water and sand samples were collected several times per day at multiple locations at each beach and analyzed for up to 41 target indicators using 67 different methodologies. Interviewers contacted participants by phone 10-14 days later and recorded symptoms of gastrointestinal illness occurring after their beach visit. Regression models were used to evaluate the association between water quality indicators and gastrointestinal illness among swimmers at each beach.Results: F+ coliphage (measured using EPA Method 1602) exhibited a stronger association with GI illness than did EPA Method 1600 at the two beaches where it was measured, while a molecular method, F+ RNA Coliphage Genotype II, was the only indicator significantly associated with GI illness at Malibu. MRSA, a known pathogen, had the strongest association with GI illness of any microbe measured at Avalon. There were two methods targeting human-associated fecal anaerobic bacteria that were more strongly associated with GI illness than EPA Method 1600, but only at Avalon. No indicator combinations consistently had a higher odds ratio than EPA Method 1600, but one composite indicator, based on the number of pathogens detected at a beach, was significantly associated with gastrointestinal illness at both Avalon and Doheny when freshwater flow was high.Discussion: While EPA Method1600 performed adequately at two beaches based on its consistency of association with gastrointestinal illness and the precision of its estimated associations, F+ coliphage measured by EPA Method 1602 had a stronger association with GI illness under high risk conditions at the two beaches where it was measured. One indicator, F+ Coliphage Genotype II was the only indicator significantly associated with GI illness at Malibu. Several indicators, particularly those targeting human associated bacteria, exhibited relationships with GI illness that were equal to or greater than that of EPA Method 1600 at Avalon, which has a focused human fecal source. Our results suggest that site-specific conditions at each beach determine which indicator or indicators best predict GI illness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Research to Operations: Evaluating Unmanned Surface Vehicles,"IEEE; Manley, JE; Leonardi, A; Beaverson, C","The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) employs many technologies in its diverse missions. NOAA challenges include monitoring the atmosphere and predicting the weather, charting the Nation's waterways, protecting marine sanctuaries, managing fisheries resources and exploring and understanding our ocean planet. In an era of strained budgets and declining availability of conventional assets, such as ships, new technologies are required to advance these missions.This paper reviews an initiative of the NOAA Ocean Observations Innovation Forum to systematically evaluate and analyze the value of new technologies, specifically the Wave Glider unmanned surface vehicle (USV), within the agency.In late 2015 the NOAA Ocean Observations Innovation Forum convened a review of the diverse applications of this technology. Working together under a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) with Liquid Robotics, the manufacturer of the Wave Glider USV, the forum commenced an evaluation of these experiments in the context of better understanding the challenges of transitioning technology from research to operations.The NOAA outlook and approach to technology transition is based upon various agency policy statements, which vary in their correlation with observed practices in Wave Glider research test and evaluation (RT&E).This effort evaluated the specific tests, trials and evaluations conducted across NOAA. These include National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), Pacific Marine Environmental Lab (PMEL), and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) demonstrations.

"Increasing the quality, comparability and accessibility of phytoplankton species composition time-series data","Zingone, A; Harrison, PJ; Kraberg, A; Lehtinen, S; McQuatters-Gollop, A; O'Brien, T; Sun, J; Jakobsen, HH","Phytoplankton diversity and its variation over an extended time scale can provide answers to a wide range of questions relevant to societal needs. These include human health, the safe and sustained use of marine resources and the ecological status of the marine environment, including long-term changes under the impact of multiple stressors. The analysis of phytoplankton data collected at the same place over time, as well as the comparison among different sampling sites, provide key information for assessing environmental change, and evaluating new actions that must be made to reduce human induced pressures on the environment. To achieve these aims, phytoplankton data may be used several decades later by users that have not participated in their production, including automatic data retrieval and analysis. The methods used in phytoplankton species analysis vary widely among research and monitoring groups, while quality control procedures have not been implemented in most cases. Here we highlight some of the main differences in the sampling and analytical procedures applied to phytoplankton analysis and identify critical steps that are required to improve the quality and inter-comparability of data obtained at different sites and/or times. Harmonization of methods may not be a realistic goal, considering the wide range of purposes of phytoplankton time-series data collection. However, we propose that more consistent and detailed metadata and complementaty information be recorded and made available along with phytoplankton time-series datasets, including description of the procedures and elements allowing for a quality control of the data. To keep up with the progress in taxonomic research, there is a need for continued training of taxonomists, and for supporting and complementing existing web resources, in order to allow a constant upgrade of knowledge in phytoplankton classification and identification. Efforts towards the improvement of metadata recording, data annotation and quality control procedures will ensure the internal consistency of phytoplankton time series and facilitate their comparability and accessibility, thus strongly increasing the value of the precious information they provide. Ultimately, the sharing of quality controlled data will allow one to recoup the high cost of obtaining the data through the multiple use of the time-series data in various projects over many decades.

Evaluation of geostatistical estimators and their applicability to characterise the spatial patterns of recreational fishing catch rates,"Aidoo, EN; Mueller, U; Goovaerts, P; Hyndes, GA","Western Australians are heavily engaged in recreational fishing activities with a participation rate of approximately 30%. An accurate estimation of the spatial distribution of recreational catch per unit effort (catch rates) is an integral component for monitoring fish population changes and to develop strategies for ecosystem-based marine management. Geostatistical techniques such as kriging can provide useful tools for characterising the spatial distributions of recreational catch rates. However, most recreational fishery data are highly skewed, zero-inflated and when expressed as ratios are impacted by the small number problem which can influence the estimates obtained from the traditional kriging. The applicability of ordinary, indicator and Poisson kriging to recreational catch rate data was evaluated for three aquatic species with different behaviours and distribution patterns. The prediction performance of each estimator was assessed based on cross-validation. For all three species, the accuracy plot of the indicator kriging (IK) showed a better agreement between expected and empirical proportions of catch rate data falling within probability intervals of increasing size, as measured by the goodness statistic. Also, indicator kriging was found to be better in predicting the latent catch rate for the three species compared to ordinary and Poisson kriging. For each species, the spatial maps from the three estimators displayed similar patterns but Poisson kriging produced smoother spatial distributions. We show that the IK estimator may be preferable for the spatial modelling of catch rate data exhibiting these characteristics, and has the best prediction performance regardless of the life history and distribution patterns of those three species.

Pacific Ocean observation programs: Gaps in ecological time series,"Koslow, JA; Couture, J","How well do existing ocean observation programs monitor the oceans through space and time? A meta-analysis of ocean observation programs in the Pacific Ocean was carried out to determine where and how key parameters defining the physics, chemistry, and biology of the oceans were measured. The analysis indicates that although the chemistry and physics of the Pacific Ocean are reasonably well monitored, ecological monitoring remains largely ad hoc, patchy, unsystematic, and inconsistent. The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI), for example, is the only Pacific Ocean program in which the zooplankton and micronekton are resolved to species with consistent time series of greater than 20 years duration. Several studies now indicate massive changes to nearshore, mesopelagic and other fish communities of the southern California Current but available time series do not allow these potential changes to be examined more widely.

Drilling to investigate processes in active tectonics and magmatism,"Shervais, J; Evans, J; Toy, V; Kirkpatrick, J; Clarke, A; Eichelberger, J","Coordinated drilling efforts are an important method to investigate active tectonics and magmatic processes related to faults and volcanoes. The US National Science Foundation (NSF) recently sponsored a series of workshops to define the nature of future continental drilling efforts. As part of this series, we convened a workshop to explore how continental scientific drilling can be used to better understand active tectonic and magmatic processes. The workshop, held in Park City, Utah, in May 2013, was attended by 41 investigators from seven countries. Participants were asked to define compelling scientific justifications for examining problems that can be addressed by coordinated programs of continental scientific drilling and related site investigations. They were also asked to evaluate a wide range of proposed drilling projects, based on white papers submitted prior to the workshop.Participants working on faults and fault zone processes highlighted two overarching topics with exciting potential for future scientific drilling research: (1) the seismic cycle and (2) the mechanics and architecture of fault zones. Recommended projects target fundamental mechanical processes and controls on faulting, and range from induced earthquakes and earthquake initiation to investigations of detachment fault mechanics and fluid flow in fault zones. Participants working on active volcanism identified five themes: the volcano eruption cycle; eruption sustainability, near-field stresses, and system recovery; eruption hazards; verification of geophysical models; and interactions with other Earth systems. Recommended projects address problems that are transferrable to other volcanic systems, such as improved methods for identifying eruption history and constraining the rheological structure of shallow caldera regions. Participants working on chemical geodynamics identified four major themes: large igneous provinces (LIPs), ocean islands, continental hotspot tracks and rifts, and convergent plate margins (subduction zones).This workshop brought together a diverse group of scientists with a broad range of scientific experience and interests. A particular strength was the involvement of both early-career scientists, who will initiate and carry out these new research programs, and more senior researchers with many years of experience in scientific drilling and active tectonics research. Each of the themes and questions outlined above has direct benefits to society, including improving hazard assessment, direct monitoring of active systems for early warning, renewable and non-renewable resource and energy exploitation, and predicting the environmental impacts of natural hazards, emphasizing the central role that scientific drilling will play in future scientific and societal developments.",2014,,SCIENTIFIC DRILLING,18,,19-33,WOS:000210346400006,10.5194/sd-18-19-2014,,#19793,Shervais 2014,,
What matters and why? Ecosystem services and their bundled qualities,"Klain, SC; Satterfield, TA; Chan, KMA","Much ecosystem service (ES) research is structured around four often implicit assumptions about ES, benefits, and stakeholders' conceptions of these: 1) ES assessors can identify and characterize priority ES across stakeholders without local participation; 2) Stakeholders derive one kind of benefit from each ES in a one-to-one, production function manner; 3) Most ESs are amenable to market or non-market economic valuation; and 4) Stakeholders primarily conceive of the importance of nature in terms of ecosystems' production of benefits. We empirically evaluated these assumptions with a map-based interview protocol to characterize what can be managed (ES and related activities), what matters (benefits) and why (valueS). Based on interviews with residents of coastal communities in British Columbia, 87% of responses to cultural ES interview prompts conveyed bundles of linked services, benefits and values. Many ES-related values (e.g., transformative and identity) matter in ways that are not adequately expressed using market or non-market valuation. Respondents used diverse metaphors about why the ocean is important, not only the ES production metaphor, which assumes that values are a function of ecosystem processes. Our research demonstrates the utility of our interview protocol for providing a fuller representation of ecosystem-related values and benefits, potentially informing environmental decision-making processes.

Evaluating legacy contaminants and emerging chemicals in marine environments using adverse outcome pathways and biological effects-directed analysis,"Hutchinson, TH; Lyons, BP; Thain, JE; Law, RJ","Natural and synthetic chemicals are essential to our daily lives, food supplies, health care, industries and safe sanitation. At the same time protecting marine ecosystems and seafood resources from the adverse effects of chemical contaminants remains an important issue. Since the 1970s, monitoring of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (FBI) chemicals using analytical chemistry has provided important spatial and temporal trend data in three important contexts; relating to human health protection from seafood contamination, addressing threats to marine top predators and finally providing essential evidence to better protect the biodiversity of commercial and non-commercial marine species. A number of regional conventions have led to controls on certain PBT chemicals over several years (termed 'legacy contaminants'; e.g. cadmium, lindane, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs] and polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]). Analytical chemistry plays a key role in evaluating to what extent such regulatory steps have been effective in leading to reduced emissions of these legacy contaminants into marine environments. In parallel, the application of biomarkers (e.g. DNA adducts, CYP1A-EROD, vitellogenin) and bioassays integrated with analytical chemistry has strengthened the evidence base to support an ecosystem approach to manage marine pollution problems. In recent years, however, the increased sensitivity of analytical chemistry, toxicity alerts and wider environmental awareness has led to a focus on emerging chemical contaminants (defined as chemicals that have been detected in the environment, but which are currently not included in regulatory monitoring programmes and whose fate and biological impacts are poorly understood). It is also known that natural chemicals (e.g. algal biotoxins) may also pose a threat to marine species and seafood quality. Hence complex mixtures of legacy contaminants, emerging chemicals and natural biotoxins in marine ecosystems represent important scientific, economic and health challenges. In order to meet these challenges and pursue cost-effective scientific approaches that can provide evidence necessary to support policy needs (e.g. the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive), it is widely recognised that there is a need to (i) provide marine exposure assessments for priority contaminants using a range of validated models, passive samplers and biomarkers; (ii) integrate chemical monitoring data with biological effects data across spatial and temporal scales (including quality controls); and (iii) strengthen the evidence base to understand the relationship between exposure to complex chemical mixtures, biological and ecological impacts through integrated approaches and molecular data (e.g. genomics, proteomics and metabolomics). Additionally, we support the widely held view that (iv) that rather than increasing the analytical chemistry monitoring of large number of emerging contaminants, it will be important to target analytical chemistry towards key groups of chemicals of concern using effects-directed analysis. It is also important to evaluate to what extent existing biomarkers and bioassays can address various classes of emerging chemicals using the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) approach now being developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with respect to human toxicology and ecotoxicology.

The project has three interlinked themes, Ecotourism, Environmental Management Systems (EMS) and Reef and Marine Recreation Management (RMRM). The project seeks to produce BAPS/BATs adoption models that can be replicated at a national and/or regional scale that includes: measures to control Land Based Pollution, diversification of the local economy and Public Private Partnerships for efficient use of resources. These models will have a results based framework, robust baseline data, cross-cutting linkages, institutional partnerships, capacity building, knowledge sharing and monitoring and evaluation exercises. A global review was conducted to refine the COAST Projects BAPS/BATS definition, resulting to adoption of positive impact, partnership and sustainability as its main results criteria. Analysis of the review and initial implementation showed that Small and Medium Enterprises from local communities, informal business and civil societies are vital in promoting Ecotourism activities. While strong quantitative and scientific baseline data are important factors in implementing EMS and RMRM activities. Cross-cutting linkages includes a process based approach, utilization of science based tools, spatial mapping, prioritization of conservation management tools, participatory resource assessments and linkages to local knowledge, private sector and the government.

Marine spatial planning in practice,"Collie, JS; Adamowicz, WL; Beck, MW; Craig, B; Essington, TE; Fluharty, D; Rice, J; Sanchirico, JN","Multiple competing uses of continental-shelf environments have led to a proliferation of marine spatial planning initiatives, together with expert guidance on marine spatial planning. This study provides an empirical review of marine spatial plans, their attributes, and the extent to which the expert guidance is actually being followed. We performed a structured review of 16 existing marine spatial plans and created an idealized marine spatial plan from the steps included in recent expert papers. A cluster analysis of the yes/no answers to 28 questions was used to ordinate the 16 marine spatial plans and to compare them with the idealized plan. All the plans that have been implemented have a high-level government mandate and the authority to implement spatial planning vested in existing institutions. Almost all the plans used data with clear criteria for data inclusion. Stakeholders were included in almost all the plans; they did not participate in all stages of the planning process but their roles were generally clearly defined. Decision-support tools were applied inconsistently across plans and were seldom used dynamically over time. Most spatial planning processes did not select specific outcomes, such as preferred use scenarios. Success is defined inconsistently across plans; in half the cases there are no metrics of success with reference benchmarks. Although monitoring is included in the majority of plans, only in some cases do monitoring results feed back into management decisions. The process of marine spatial planning had advanced in that some of the more recent plans were developed more quickly and contain more desirable attributes than earlier plans.

"An assessment of participation, catch and effort in the KwaZulu-Natal shore-based marine linefishery, with comments on management effectiveness","Dunlop, SW; Mann, BQ","The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of current management of the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) shore-based marine linefishery. Methods used included a stratified-random creel survey and an associated questionnaire survey. The study was undertaken between February 2009 and January 2010. Total participation ranged between 41 283 and 68 087 shore-anglers. Results show that there has been little change in participation in the KZN shore-fishery since 1994-1996. In contrast, total angler effort (779 382-843 702 angler-days y(-1)) has decreased substantially over the past 13 years. Overall catch per unit effort (CPUE) for the KZN shore-linefishery amounted to 0.18 +/- 0.3 fish angler(-1) h(-1) or 0.07 +/- 0.13 kg angler(-1) h(-1). In all, 84 fish species, belonging to 39 families, were recorded in catches of shore-anglers during the study period. Only five species accounted for 75% of the catch recorded along the coast (Sarpa salpa 34.8%, Pomatomus saltatrix 14.7%, Diplodus capensis 14.5%, Pomadasys olivaceum 6.5% and Rhabdosargus holubi 4.9%). The total annual catch for the KZN shore-linefishery was estimated between 249.2 and 276.7 t y(-1) (or 636 589-706 995 fish y(-1)). Analysis of overall CPUE, catch composition and total catch in the shore-based linefishery of KZN suggested that it is currently in a relatively stable condition and that little change has occurred over the past 13 years. However, comparisons of species-specific CPUE values from this study with recent literature suggest that some species (e. g. Argyrosomus japonicus) are severely overexploited. Over the past few decades there seems to have been a gradual transition in landings from long-lived, high trophic-level, piscivorous fish (e.g. A. japonicus) to more short-lived, low trophic-level species (e.g. S. salpa). The results therefore suggest that present exploitation levels may not be sustainable for certain slow-growing, long-lived fish species. Current management regulations appear to have limited effectiveness based on poor angler compliance and knowledge of the regulations. In this regard, it is important to consider alternate management measures that may offer more effective protection to fish and at the same time be more easily understood by all anglers in the linefishery. Recommendations for improved management and the importance of the establishment of an effective MPA network are briefly discussed.",2012,,AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE,34,4,479-496,WOS:000312298900002,10.2989/1814232X.2012.725526,,#19799,Dunlop 2012,,OUTSIDE OF MPA
Efforts to reduce sea turtle bycatch in the shrimp fishery in Northeastern Brazil through a co-management process,"da Silva, ACCD; de Castilhos, JC; dos Santos, EAP; Brondizio, LS; Bugoni, L","The neritic waters of the state of Sergipe in Northeastern Brazil is adjacent to the main nesting area of the olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) in the Western Atlantic Ocean and an important area for shrimp trawl fishery. To address the problem of incidental mortality of sea turtles captured during trawling and reduce the risk of overexploitation of shrimp stocks, Projeto TAMAR/ICMBio, a Brazilian sea turtle conservation program, has adopted two main strategies: (1) the implementation of a marine monitoring program and (2) active participation in local forums. This paper describes the conflicts among stakeholders, the arrangements and established mechanisms of negotiation aimed to protect sea turtles and shrimp grounds, and strategies to reduce conflicts between user groups. The analysis of this co-management process highlights the importance of stakeholder participation in resource management decision-making through a cooperative process, the role assumed by non-governmental organizations as mediators, and the factors that influence this system. The key factors and actions learnt from the current study include clear identification of the conflicts, identification of stakeholders both local and external, and local leaders, encouragement of actors and leaders to participate, support and strengthening of local groups, legitimization of the discussion forums through involvement with government, formalization of decisions taken through legislation, and monitoring of the management efficacy.

Climate change and food safety: A review,"Tirado, MC; Clarke, R; Jaykus, LA; McQuatters-Gollop, A; Franke, JM","Climate change and variability may have an impact on the occurrence of food safety hazards at various stages of the food chain, from primary production through to consumption. There are multiple pathways through which climate related factors may impact food safety including: changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, ocean warming and acidification, and changes in contaminants' transport pathways among others. Climate change may also affect socio-economic aspects related to food systems such as agriculture, animal production, global trade, demographics and human behaviour which all influence food safety.This paper reviews the potential impacts of predicted changes in climate on food contamination and food safety at various stages of the food chain and identifies adaptation strategies and research priorities to address food safety implications of climate change. The paper concludes that there is a need for intersectoral and international cooperation to better understand the changing food safety situation and in developing and implementing adaptation strategies to address emerging risks associated with climate change.

Predicting the consequences of nutrient reduction on the eutrophication status of the North Sea,"Lenhart, HJ; Mills, DK; Baretta-Bekker, H; van Leeuwen, SM; van der Molen, J; Baretta, JW; Blaas, M; Desmit, X; Kuhn, W; Lacroix, G; Los, HJ; Menesguen, A; Neves, R; Proctor, R; Ruardij, P; Skogen, MD; Vanhoutte-Brunier, A; Villars, MT; Wakelin, SL","In this paper the results from a workshop of the OSPAR Intersessional Correspondence Group on Eutrophication Modelling (ICG-EMO) held in Lowestoft in 2007 are presented. The aim of the workshop was to compare the results of a number of North Sea ecosystem models under different reduction scenarios. In order to achieve comparability of model results the participants were requested to use a minimum spin-up time, common boundary conditions which were derived from a wider-domain model, and a set of common forcing data, with special emphasis on a complete coverage of river nutrient loads. Based on the OSPAR requirements river loads were derived, taking into account the reductions already achieved between 1985 and 2002 for each country. First, for the year 2002, for which the Comprehensive Procedure was applied, the different horizontal distributions of net primary production are compared. Furthermore, the differences in the net primary production between the hindcast run and the 50% nutrient reduction runs are displayed. In order to compare local results, the hindcast and reduction runs are presented for selected target areas and scored against the Comprehensive Procedure assessment levels for the parameters DIN, DIP and chlorophyll. Finally, the temporal development of the assessment parameter bottom oxygen concentration from several models is compared with data from the Dutch monitoring station Terschelling 135.The conclusion from the workshop was that models are useful to support the application of the OSPAR Comprehensive Procedure. The comparative exercise formulated specifically for the workshop required models to be evaluated for pre-defined target areas previously classified as problem areas according to the first application of the Comprehensive Procedure. The responsiveness of the modelled assessment parameters varied between different models but in general the parameter showed a larger response in coastal rather than in offshore waters, which in some cases lead to the goal to achieve a non-problem status. Therefore, the application of the Comprehensive Procedure on model results for parameter assessment opens a new potential in testing eutrophication reduction measures within the North Sea catchment.As a result of the workshop further work was proposed to confirm and bolster confidence in the results. One general field of difficulty appeared to be the model forcing with SPM data in order to achieve realistic levels of light attenuation. Finally, effects of the prescribed spin-up procedure are compared against a long-term run over many years and consequences on the resulting initial nutrient concentrations are highlighted.

Performance evaluation of nitrogen isotope ratio determination in marine and lacustrine sediments: An inter-laboratory comparison,"Bahlmann, E; Bernasconi, SM; Bouillon, S; Houtekamer, M; Korntheuer, M; Langenberg, F; Mayr, C; Metzke, M; Middelburg, JJ; Nagel, B; Struck, U; Voss, M; Emeis, KC","Nitrogen isotopes of organic matter are increasingly studied in marine biogeochemistry and geology, plant and animal ecology, and paleoceanography. Here, we present results of an inter-laboratory test on determination of nitrogen isotope ratios in marine and lacustrine sediments. Six different samples covering a wide range of total nitrogen content and delta(15)N values were analyzed by eight different laboratories using their routine procedures. The laboratories were asked to measure three batches with three replicates for each sample to assess accuracy and variability within and among laboratories; this permits assessment of repeatability and reproducibility, which are essential in meta analysis of the increasing database on delta(15)N values in marine sediments. The grand average delta(15)N values for individual samples ranged from 1.65-10.90 parts per thousand One laboratory exhibited an average bias of -0.27 parts per thousand compared to the mean of all other laboratories. Apart from one sample, which showed an exceptionally high overall standard deviation (OSD) of 0.51 parts per thousand, the analytical precision (1 s) averaged 0.24 parts per thousand, ranging from 0.18-0.31 parts per thousand. for individual samples. Out of the eight participating laboratories, two showed a significantly elevated within-laboratory standard deviation (WLSD) of 0.41 parts per thousand and 0.32 parts per thousand compared to an average WLSD of 0.15 parts per thousand for the other laboratories. The WLSD was inversely correlated with the ratio of peak height to peak width, which was taken as a simple measure of peak shape. Moreover, our data also revealed an inverse correlation between total nitrogen content and measurement precision. These correlations may provide guidance for improving the measurement precision of individual laboratories. Based on the results of this round robin test, we have estimated the expanded measurement uncertainty on the 2 sigma level to 0.45 parts per thousand for sediment samples with a nitrogen content >0.07 wt%. Sediment samples with lower nitrogen contents cannot be measured with sufficient precision without additional precautions and care should be taken when interpreting delta(15)N signatures and records for sediments with nitrogen concentrations <0.07 wt%.

Heavy metals in edible seaweeds commercialised for human consumption,"Besada, V; Andrade, JM; Schultze, F; Gonzalez, JJ","Though seaweed consumption is growing steadily across Europe, relatively few studies have reported on the quantities of heavy metals they contain and/or their potential effects on the Population's health. This study focuses an the first topic and analyses the concentrations of six typical heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, Cu, Zn, total As and inorganic As) in 52 samples from 11 algae-based products commercialised in Spain for direct human consumption (Gelidium spp.; Eisenia bicyclis; Himanthalia elongata: Hizikia fusiforme; Laminaria spp.; Ulva rigida; Chondrus crispus: Porphyra umbilicales and Undaria pinnatifida).Samples were ground, homogenised and quantified by atomic absorption spectrometry (Cu and Zn by flame AAS; Cd, Pb and total As by electrothermal AAS; total mercury by the cold vapour technique; and inorganic As by flame-hydride generation). Accuracy was assessed by participation in periodic QUASIMEME (Quality Assurance of Information in Marine Environmental Monitoring in Europe) and IAEA (international Atomic Energy Agency) intercalibration exercises, To detect any objective differences existing between the seaweeds' metal concentrations, univariate and multivariate studies (principal component analysis, cluster analysis and linear discriminant analysis) were performed. It is concluded that the Hizikia fusiforme samples contained the highest values of total and inorganic As and that most Cd concentrations exceeded the French Legislation. The two harvesting areas (Atlantic and Pacific oceans) were differentiated using both univariate studies (for Cu, total As, Hg and Zn) and a multivariate discriminant function (which includes Zn, Cu and Pb).

Strategic management of marine ecosystems using whole-ecosystem simulation modelling: The 'back to the future' policy approach,"Pitcher, TJ; Ainsworth, CH; Buchary, EA; Cheung, WL; Forrest, R; Haggan, N; Lozano, H; Morato, T; Morissette, L","'Back-to-the-Future' (BTF) attempts to solve the 'fisheries crisis' by using past ecosystems as policy goals for the future. BTF provides an integrative approach to the strategic management of marine ecosystems with policies based on restoration ecology, and an understanding of marine ecosystem processes in the light of findings from terrestrial ecology. BTF employs recent developments in whole ecosystem simulation modelling that allow the analysis of uncertainty, tuning to past biomass estimates, and responses to climate changes. It includes new methods for describing past ecosystems, for designing fisheries that meet criteria for sustainability and responsibility, and for evaluating the costs and benefits of fisheries in restored ecosystems. Comparison of ecosystems before and after major perturbations, including investigation of uncertain ecological issues, may set constraints as to what may or may not be restored. Understanding how climate and ocean changes influence marine ecosystems may allow policies to be made robust against such factors. A new technique of intergenerational discounting is applied to economic analyses, allowing policies favouring conservation, as the same time as addressing economic standard discounting of future benefits. Automated searches maximise values of a range of alternative objective functions, and the methodology includes ways to account for uncertainty in model parameters. The evaluation of alternative policy choices, involving trade-offs between conservation and economic values, employs a range of economic, social and ecological measures. BTF policy also utilizes insight into the human dimension of fisheries management. Participatory workshops attempt to maximise compliance by fostering a sense of ownership among all stakeholders: ideally, collaboration by scientists, the maritime community, managers and policy-makers may build intellectual capital in the model, and social capital in terms of increased trust. BTF may help to reverse the shifting baseline syndrome by broadening the cognitive maps of resource users. Some challenges that have still be met include improving methods for quantitatively describing the past, reducing uncertainty in ecosystem simulation techniques and in making policy choices robust against climate change. Critical issues include whether past ecosystems make viable policy goals, and whether desirable goals may be reached from today's ecosystem. Examples are presented from case studies in British Columbia, Newfoundland and the Gulf of St Lawrence in Canada; the Gulf of California, Mexico; the Bali Strait and Komodo National Park in Indonesia; and the South China Sea.",2005,,STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF MARINE ECOSYSTEMS,50,,199-258,WOS:000233133900013,,,#19807,Pitcher 2005,,
Plankton of the Baltic estuarine ecosystems with emphasis on Neva Estuary: a review of present knowledge and research perspectives,"Telesh, IV","Different levels of eutrophication and pollution in the Baltic coastal waters in general, and in estuaries particularly define variations in the buffering capacity of ecosystems of these important filter zones between rivers and the adjacent Baltic Proper. Phyto- and zooplankton in the estuaries form important components of the pelagic food webs that participate in producing and structuring the matter, energy, and information fluxes in the ecosystems. Due to salinity gradients, estuaries provide a large variety of aquatic habitats for native populations of marine, brackish and fresh water plankton species. Non-indigenous planktonic species that expand their bio-geographical range and invade the Baltic coastal ecosystems also find favourable environments, establish permanent populations there, and impact aboriginal ecosystems. The dynamics of abundance, species diversity, population structure, productivity of planktonic communities, and peculiarities of trophic interactions in different Baltic estuaries are influenced by a number of common environmental factors. Being measured on the unified basis and monitored, changes (or stability) of structural and functional parameters of plankton communities can serve as indicators of alterations to the ecosystems. Comparative analyses and quantitative estimates of long-term changes in phyto- and zooplankton can contribute to evaluation of functional response of Baltic coastal ecosystems to anthropogenic stress. Both theoretical (modeling) and empirical studies of interactions within plankton communities aimed at the assessment of the role of planktonic organisms in water quality regulation, and applicability of these data for the evaluation of the status of ecosystems and their management can be considered as major goals for the future investigations in Baltic estuaries.

"Long-term marine litter monitoring in the remote great Australian Bight, South Australia","Edyvane, KS; Dalgetty, A; Hone, PW; Higham, JS; Wace, NM","The Anxious Bay beach litter clearance is the longest running annual survey of ocean-based litter in Australia. It's remoteness from centres of human population and location (with respect to prevailing winds and currents) make it an ideal place for monitoring ocean or ship-based litter in Australia's southern oceans and particularly, the Great Australian Bight. Over the 1991-1999 period, a large but gradual decline in the amount of beach washed litter was recorded (with minor peaks recorded during the 1992 and 1994 surveys). Beach washed litter decreased by approximately 86%, from 344 kg recorded in 1991 (13.2 kg/km) to 49 kg in 1999 (i.e. 1.9 kg/km), reaching a maximum of 390 kg in 1992 (or 15 kg/km of beach). However, a sharp increase in litter was recorded in 2000 (i.e. 252 kg or 9.7 kg/km). This increase in litter yield in 2000 is probably due to stronger than average onshore surface flow (or Ekman Transport) in the western Eyre Peninsula and Bight region. Prior to the survey in 2000, the results appeared to indicate that ocean litter on Anxious Bay beach was beginning to level out at around 50-70 kg/year (i.e. 2-3 kg/km). As the beach surveys involve the assumption that the beach is completely cleared of litter, this may represent a baseline level for ocean-based litter in the region. The yields and type of litter collected from the annual survey indicates that the majority of litter washed ashore originates from commercial fishing activities within the Great Australian Bight. Most of the fishing-related litter was directly sourced to the Southern Rock Lobster Fishery (i.e. bait buckets, baskets, pots), the Great Australian Bight Trawl Fishery (i.e. codends, trawl nets) and the Southern Shark Fishery (i.e. monofilament gillnets and longlines).Between 1994 and 1999, large reductions were observed in the amount of bait straps (77% reduction), lobster bait baskets/buckets (86% reduction), nets/ropes (62% reduction) and floats/buoys (83% reduction). Significantly, fishing-related litter in the Bight has reduced at a slower rate than domestic litter. While the level of glass and soft plastics on the beach have both reduced by almost 93% (i.e. 103-7 kg and 119-8 kg, respectively), the level of hard plastics, has diminished at a slower rate, with reductions of only 75% (i.e. 122-30 kg). Some fisheries (i.e. rock lobster, Southern Shark Fishery) have shown marked reductions in fishing-related litter. This is probably due, to some extent, to significant reductions in fishing effort in the region, although this requires further investigation.The information from the Anxious Bay beach litter survey is crucial in monitoring trends in ocean litter in Australia's southern oceans and compliance with international litter regulations. While fishing-related litter remains the major source of ship-based or ocean litter in Australia's southern oceans, the continued reduction in ship-based litter since 1991 supports increasing compliance to MARPOL (Annex V) by commercial fisheries and shipping in the Great Australian Bight.While Australia participates in marine debris monitoring programs in the Antarctic (under CCAMLR), there is currently no national program or management framework to assess, manage and monitor ocean-based litter along Australia's coasts, and monitor compliance with MARPOL. Apart from the commitments under CCAMLR for Antarctic (and sub-Antarctic) marine environments, there are no other regional programs, guidelines or monitoring protocols or to assess and manage ocean litter in the Southern Ocean.

Evaluations of marine reserves as basis to develop alternative livelihoods in coastal areas of the Philippines,"Kuhlmann, KJ","The 11 marine reserves along the Leyte Gulf, Eastern Samar, Philippines were quantified in terms of reef slope composition, hard coral coverage and standing fish biomass by manta tow and transect dive survey from 1998 to 1999. Based on the assessed ecological conditions (Condition Index, CI; Coral Coverage Index, CCI; Reef Condition Index, RCI; Fish Biomass) and derived ranking, suitable small-scale alternative livelihoods (aquaculture or land-based) to be implemented nearby these reserves were discussed and developed with the involvement of the local stakeholders composed of fishers, farmers, Non-Government Organization and Local Government Units, in a 3-day planning workshop.The reserves' RCI (0.20 to 0.40) resulted in fair (9 reserves) and poor (2 reserves) conditions as indicated by 64 to 68% of non-living and 32 to 36% of living slope substrate, CI of 0.15 to 0.54, CCI of 0.15 to 0.49, and fish biomass of 1.8 to 19.6 t km(-2).

Lessons in regional cooperation from the arctic,"Stenlund, P","The Arctic Council is an intergovernmental forum for the Arctic states, which have an outreach beyond the Arctic circle. It is a unique international regime for cooperation among governments and indigenous peoples. The Arctic Council has a very light administration and no obligatory funding. The Host Country of the Council provides a Secretariat and serves as a hub in a network in active operation. Projects are administered by a lead partner, often a Member State or a Indigenous people's organisation. Most of the work is done in Working Groups of Experts. In 1998, The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme delivered a science-based Assessment Report on Arctic Pollution Issues. This report has influenced strongly on the global negotiations on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals. The Stockholm Convention on POPs 2001 is a significant step forward for the protection of the Arctic environment and for people living in the Arctic, who are dependent on harvesting as a central source of livelihood. The Arctic Council has adopted a Regional Plan of Action, which follows the UNEP methodology on the Protection of the Marine Environment from land-based activities. In June 2001, a report on the status and conservation of Flora and Fauna was delivered to the Arctic Council by the experts, who were requested to prepare recommendations on biodiversity conservation on the basis of the status report. The most important project for the time being is the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment. Close to 200 climate scientific experts from I I countries are participating in the project, which will deliver its final report in 2004. Science-based decision making is an Arctic Council brand. In addition, the Council takes into account traditional knowledge provided by indigenous peoples. The overall goal is to enhance sustainable development in the Arctic. The Council contributes to a better knowledge base for decision-making. Political recommendations are agreed upon unanimously. Much of the implementation is done by the member states themselves and appropriate international organisations. The ambition is to integrate sustainable development principles into all activities and projects under the auspices of the Arctic Council. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The target compounds included chlorinated alkanes and alkenes, monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and covered a wide range of VOCs of environmental interest. Limits of detection ranged from 0.15 ng l(-1) to 6.57 ng l(-1) for all VOCs, except for dichloromethane (41.07 ng l(-1)), chloroform (19.74 ng l(-1)), benzene (22.05 ng l(-1)) and 1,4-dichlorobenzene (20.43 ng l(-1)), Precision and accuracy were determined at a concentration level of 25.97 to 66.68 ng l(-1). Besides method validation, emphasis was put on quality control and assessment during routine determination of VOCs in marine water samples. Analytical quality control charts were plotted for all VOCs and a standard addition test was performed, as proposed by the QUASIMEME (Quality Assurance of Information in Marine Environmental Monitoring Programmes in Europe) working group. The analytical charts were incorporated in a working scheme containing guidelines to be applied during routine determinations, ensuring the long time reliability of the analytical method.

Critical evaluation of an intercalibration exercise undertaken in the framework of the MED POL biomonitoring program,"Viarengo, A; Lafaurie, M; Gabrielides, GP; Fabbri, R; Marro, A; Romeo, M","The results of an intercalibration exercise among the laboratories participating in the MED POL program for monitoring biological effects of pollutants along the Mediterranean coasts are presented. Three established biomarkers, i.e. lysosomal membrane stability, metallothionein concentration and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, were intercalibrated. The stability of lysosomal membranes in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam.) was assessed with a cytochemical method. The four participating laboratories were able to discriminate between control animals (membrane labilization times ranging from 21 to 35 min) and Cu-exposed animals (40 mu g/l Cu for 3 days) (labilization times ranging from 4.5 to 7.4 min). The metallothionein concentration was evaluated in digestive gland homogenates of control mussels and of animals exposed to 200 mu g/l Cd for 7 days. The eight participating laboratories were able to discriminate between controls and treated samples using a spectrophotometric method. The EROD activity was evaluated by 11 laboratories. All laboratories were able to discriminate between liver microsomal preparations obtained from control and from benzo-a-pyrene exposed fisk(Dicentrarchus labrax), with values ranging from 0.5 to 15.88 pmol/min/mg protein in controls and from 5.41 to 165.13 pmol/min/mg protein in treated animals. Using S9 fractions, it was possible to correctly identify control and treated fish, with a variation similar to that found using microsomal fractions, albeit with an inevitable difference in specific activity. As a corollary, all laboratories involved produced comparable data and were able to identify pollutant-induced stress syndromes in sentinel organisms. Thus, intercalibration enables the use of biomarkers in large biomonitoring programs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The IAEA worldwide intercomparison exercises (1990-1997): determination of trace elements in marine sediments and biological samples,"Coquery, M; Carvalho, FP; Azemard, S; Horvat, M","Four major worldwide intercomparison exercises for the determination of trace elements in various environmental matrices acre completed by the IAEA Marine Environment Laboratory since 1990: SD-M-2/TM, deep sea marine sediment; IAEA-350, tuna fish homogenate; IAEA-356, contaminated coastal sediment and IAEA-140, sea plant (Fucus sp.). These intercomparison exercises aim at enabling individual laboratories to monitor their performance. The results of these exercises allowed us to make an overall evaluation of the quality of data provided for environmental assessment and to identify the trends of analytical performance in the determination of trace elements over the years. The number of participants in each exercise varied between 68 and 130, and permits statistical evaluation of the performance for a number of elements. For each intercomparison exercise, the performance of the participant laboratories was assessed by comparing reported results with established reference values calculating 'Z-scores'. The results show that for each sample matrix, the values reported by some laboratories were far from satisfactory in the earlier exercises, in particular for Cd, Cr and Pb. Nevertheless, over time, a general improvement of performance can clearly be seen for all elements. Moreover, there was a noticeable increase in the number of laboratories with good performance in the two most recent exercises, observed both for biological and for sediment matrices. However, the determination of trace elements such as Cd, Cr, Pb and Hg in low level environmental samples still remains a major challenge to the analysts. For this reason and in order to assess the current performance of laboratories for low environmental levels of contaminants, the future intercomparison exercises will concentrate on low level sediment and fish samples.

Marine capacity building in North and West Africa,"Snoussi, M; Awosika, L","The North and West African coastal and marine areas discussed in this paper consist of the countries from Morocco to Libya for North Africa, and from Morocco to South Africa (up to the Cape of Good Hope) in West Africa. These marine areas consist of a wide to narrow continental shelf, estuaries, lagoons, coastal plains, isolated mountains, mangroves and wetlands. These areas are centres of productive socioeconomic activities with a high population density, vast fisheries, and mineral resources. Presently, these resources are exploited with little attention far the environmental consequences. Sustainable management of the marine environment and its resources requires effective management plans and a human capacity to formulate, implement and monitor these plans. However, most of the countries still lack funds, human and infrastructural capacity for the management of their marine territories and its resources. Though there are many universities, research institutes and private organisations with a modest infrastructure for both data and information handling and the management of the marine environment, the region still lags behind in human and infra-structural capacity. Existing capacity development programmes by United Nations agencies, governments, universities, nongovernmental agencies, have so far not been very effective. A vigorous marine capacity building effort is needed toensure the sustainable management of the marine environment In this African region. Externally funded programmes with a focus ensuring technology cooperation are needed. Such programmes must be based on mutual co-operation and participation of scientists and administrators from the region at all levels of programme formulation, implementation and assessment.

Integrated coastal management: a concept in practice in central California through the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary,"Jackson, T","The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) encompasses over 5,000 square miles of ocean area along the California coast between San Francisco and Cambria. The overall goal of the program is to protect and enhance natural resources in a wide array of habitats within its boundaries. MBNMS achieves this goal through a responsive integrated coastal management approach that promotes cooperation between the Sanctuary office and other public agencies and capitalizes on the expertise of individuals and interest groups that share a common interest in preserving the natural resources of the Sanctuary. The structure of the program involves integrating a small Sanctuary staff with various management agencies and interest groups. An example of this integration includes coordination with the Sanctuary Advisory Council, made up of twenty-four representatives from public agencies and user interests plus specific working groups for research (22 marine institutions), education (20 educational institutions) and conservation (15 conservation organizations). The Sanctuary also is involved in developing a water quality protection program for the region that presently involves twenty-seven different agencies plus interest groups. Additionally, the public has opportunities for input into the program through council meetings, through representatives from working groups or council members, and through contact with Sanctuary staff. The MBNMS program is linked nationally with eleven other Sanctuaries and twenty-six Estuarine Research Reserves through the Sanctuaries and Reserves Division in Washington DC. This integrated approach has addressed numerous issues ranging from assessing former military exclusion zones and improving water quality to facilitating multiple resource use conflicts such as shark chumming. In this manuscript, I will outline the structure and process of the MBNMS integrated management approach and provide examples of resource management issues that have been addressed.",1998,,"CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD OCEAN '97 - TAKING A LOOK AT CALIFORNIA'S OCEAN RESOURCES: AN AGENDA FOR THE FUTURE, VOLS 1 AND 2, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS",,,594-599,WOS:000075224700083,,,#19816,Jackson 1998,,
"ACOUSTIC MAPPING AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT TOOL .1. DETECTION OF BARRELS OF LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE-WASTE, GULF-OF-THE-FARALLONES NATIONAL-MARINE-SANCTUARY, CALIFORNIA","KARL, HA; SCHWAB, WC; WRIGHT, ASC; DRAKE, DE; CHIN, JL; DANFORTH, WW; UEBER, E","The oceans have been and will continue to be disposal sites for a wide variety of waste products. Often these wastes are not dumped at the designated sites or transport occurs during or after dumping, and, subsequent attempts to monitor the effects the waste products have on the environment are inadequate because the actual location of the waste is not known. Acoustic mapping of the seafloor with sidescan sonar is a very effective technique for locating and monitoring dredge-spoil material and other debris. Sidescan sonar provides an acoustic image or sonograph of the sea floor that is similar to a satellite image of the Earth's land surface. In effect sidescan sonar allows the water column to be stripped from the sea floor, thereby providing a clear, unobstructed view of the sea bed.An example of the potential of this technique is summarized herein for the Gulf of the Farallones region. More than 47 800 drums (55 gallon) and other containers of low-level radioactive waste were dumped on the continental margin offshore the San Francisco Bay between 1946 and 1970. These drums now litter a large area (1200 km2) of the sea floor within the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS). The exact location of the drums and the potential hazard the drums pose to the environment are unknown. To evaluate the risk, samples of the sediment, biota and water must be collected near and distant from the concentrations of barrels. To do this the exact location of the barrels must be known prior to sampling. The USGS, through a cooperative research agreement with GFNMS, used sidescan sonar to map two areas within the sanctuary. Total sea-floor coverage was obtained and computer-processed sonographic mosaics were constructed on board ship. Many small nongeologic targets were distributed throughout the survey areas that covered about 70 km2 on the shelf and 120 kM2  on the slope. Analysis of the sidescan data suggests that the targets are 55-gallon drums. This interpretation was confirmed at one site with an underwater video and 35-mm camera system. Data were collected with both a 30-kHz and a 120-kHz sidescan system within a 15-km2 area on the shelf. We found that the barrels were more easily detected with the mid-range 30-kHz system than with the higher resolution 120-kHz system. Maps of barrel distribution derived from the sonographs are being used to design sampling schemes to evaluate the risk that the radioactivity may have on the biota and environment.",1994,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,22,3,201-227,WOS:A1994ND51900003,10.1016/0964-5691(94)90032-9,,#19817,KARL 1994,,

We aimed to determine whether melflufen plus dexamethasone would provide a progression-free survival benefit compared with pomalidomide plus dexamethasone in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. Methods In this randomised, open-label, head-to-head, phase 3 study (OCEAN), adult patients (aged >= 18 years) were recruited from 108 university hospitals, specialist hospitals, and community-based centres in 21 countries across Europe, North America, and Asia. Eligible patients had an ECOG performance status of 0-2; must have had relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, refractory to lenalidomide (within 18 months of randomisation) and to the last line of therapy; and have received two to four previous lines of therapy (including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by age, number of previous lines of therapy, and International Staging System score, to either 28-day cycles of melflufen and dexamethasone (melflufen group) or pomalidomide and dexamethasone (pomalidomide group). All patients received dexamethasone 40 mg orally on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle. In the melflufen group, patients received melflufen 40 mg intravenously over 30 min on day 1 of each cycle and in the pomalidomide group, patients received pomalidomide 4 mg orally daily on days 1 to 21 of each cycle. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by an independent review committee in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03151811, and is ongoing. Findings Between June 12, 2017, and Sept 3, 2020, 246 patients were randomly assigned to the melflufen group (median age 68 years [IQR 60-72]; 107 [43%] were female) and 249 to the pomalidomide group (median age 68 years [IQR 61-72]; 109 [44%] were female). 474 patients received at least one dose of study drug (melflufen group n=228; pomalidomide group n=246; safety population). Data cutoff was Feb 3, 2021. Median progression-free survival was 6middot8 months (95% CI 5middot0-8middot5; 165 [67%] of 246 patients had an event) in the melflufen group and 4middot9 months (4middot2-5middot7; 190 [76%] of 249 patients had an event) in the pomalidomide group (hazard ratio [HR] 0middot79, [95% CI 0middot64-0middot98]; p=0middot032), at a median follow-up of 15middot5 months (IQR 9middot4-22middot8) in the melflufen group and 16middot3 months (10middot1-23middot2) in the pomalidomide group. Median overall survival was 19middot8 months (95% CI 15middot1-25middot6) at a median follow-up of 19middot8 months (IQR 12middot0-25middot0) in the melflufen group and 25middot0 months (95% CI 18middot1-31middot9) in the pomalidomide group at a median follow-up of 18middot6 months (IQR 11middot8-23middot7; HR 1middot10 [95% CI 0middot85-1middot44]; p=0middot47). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were thrombocytopenia (143 [63%] of 228 in the melflufen group vs 26 [11%] of 246 in the pomalidomide group), neutropenia (123 [54%] vs 102 [41%]), and anaemia (97 [43%] vs 44 [18%]).Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 95 (42%) patients in the melflufen group and 113 (46%) in the pomalidomide group, the most common of which were pneumonia (13 [6%] vs 21 [9%]), COVID-19 pneumonia (11 [5%] vs nine [4%]), and thrombocytopenia (nine [4%] vs three [1%]). 27 [12%] patients in the melflufen group and 32 [13%] in the pomalidomide group had fatal treatment-emergent adverse events. Fatal treatment-emergent adverse events were considered possibly treatment related in two patients in the melflufen group (one with acute myeloid leukaemia, one with pancytopenia and acute cardiac failure) and four patients in the pomalidomide group (two patients with pneumonia, one with myelodysplastic syndromes, one with COVID-19 pneumonia).

"Defining deep-sea fishery stocks through multiple methods: The case of the red crab Chaceon notialis Manning & Holthuis, 1989 (Crustacea, Decapoda, Geryonidae) in the Southwestern Atlantic","Cortinhas, MCD; Ortega, I; Teodoro, SDA; Proietti, M; Masello, A; Kersanach, R; Barutot, R; Vieira, RRR; Firpo, C; Mauna, C; Dumont, LFC","The red crab Chaceon notialis is endemic to the Southwestern Atlantic (Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina), occurring from 200 to 1600 m deep. The species belongs to the Geryonidae family and exhibits a K-strategist life cycle. Due to its increased exploitation over recent decades, this marine resource requires attention regarding its conservation and management. In this work, were analyzed red crab populations from the three countries that cover the species' entire distribution range, assessing diversity and differentiation through morphometric and genetic analyses. The evaluated morphometric measurements were length and width of the carapace; length, width and height of the chelae propodus; and female abdomen width. For genetic evaluation, the following mitochondrial DNA regions were used: the partial 12S gene and the entire Control Region (861 bp); and the partial Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (1252 bp). The morphometric results showed two distinct phenotypic groups (one from Brazil/Uruguay and the other from Argentina), with significant differences in female abdomen width and chela size. Genetic analyses, however, revealed only a single panmictic population, with no genetic structuring among the analyzed stocks. These findings suggest that the management measures applied in each country will influence the population dynamics of the others, and that international cooperation is necessary for achieving sustainable fisheries of this valuable resource. Since commercial fishing of the red crab C. notialis is not conducted in Argentina, we propose that this area can act as a biological reserve for this species. Due to the commercial importance of this crab, knowledge of the species' diversity is of fundamental importance for its management, conservation, and to provide baselines for future biological and ecological studies.",2022,,DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS,179,,,WOS:000721033400002,10.1016/j.dsr.2021.103659,,#19819,Cortinhas 2022,,
The Efficacy of Management Measures to Reduce Vessel Noise in Critical Habitat of Southern Resident Killer Whales in the Salish Sea,"Burnham, RE; Vagle, S; O'Neill, C; Trounce, K","The inland waters around southern Vancouver Island and northern Washington State, known as the Salish Sea, host critical habitat for endangered southern resident killer whales (SRKW). This is, however, a highly traversed area, with approaches to industrial ports and coastal cities, international shipping lanes, ferry routes, and considerable recreational vessel traffic. Vessel noise is a key threat to SRKW prosperity, and so conservation measures directed to mitigate its effects have been explored annually since 2017. Here, we describe trials undertaken in 2020, which included spatially limited slowdown zones, exclusion areas as Interim whale Sanctuary Zones (ISZs), and a lateral displacement of tug transits to increase the distance between their route and SRKW foraging areas. To assess each of the measures we first considered the level of mariner participation using data from the Automated Identification Systems (AIS), mandatory for commercial vessels. Knowing this, the changes in soundscape were examined, focused on impacts on broadband (10 Hz to 100 kHz) ambient noise and the frequencies used by SRKW for communication (500 Hz to 15 kHz) and echolocation (15 to 100 kHz). A control period of two-months prior to trial initiation was used to quantify the changes. High levels (> 80%) of compliance were found for each measure, except ISZs, where observance was low. Median reduction in speeds ranged from 0.2-3.5 knots. Resulting sound reductions were most notable in the lower frequencies, although reductions were also recorded in SRKW pertinent ranges. Tug displacement also reduced ambient noise in these frequencies, despite making up a small portion of the overall traffic. The management trials were effective in reducing potential impacts singularly and in concert. Greater awareness and stakeholder engagement may increase compliance and, therefore, the efficacy of measures in the future.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000686134400001,10.3389/fmars.2021.664691,,#19820,Burnham 2021,,
Bioprospecting Antiproliferative Marine Microbiota From Submarine Volcano Tagoro,"Garcia-Davis, S; Reyes, CP; Lagunes, I; Padron, JM; Fraile-Nuez, E; Fernandez, JJ; Diaz-Marrero, AR","Marine ecosystems are unique and rich reservoirs of biodiversity with high potential toward improving the quality of human life. The extreme physical-chemical conditions of the oceans have favored marine organisms to produce a great variety of new molecules as a mechanism to ensure their survival, and such compounds possess great biopharmaceutical interest. In particular, marine microbiota represent a promising and inexhaustible source for the development of new drugs. This work presents the taxonomic study of the samples obtained from the underwater volcano Tagoro, which has allowed us to develop a collection of 182 marine bacterial strains. On October 10th, 2011, at La Restinga-El Mar de Las Calmas Marine Reserve, an underwater eruption gave rise to a novel shallow submarine volcano at 1.8 km south of the island of El Hierro, Canary Islands, Spain. During the first 6 months, extreme physical-chemical perturbations, comprising thermal changes, water acidification, deoxygenation, and metal enrichment, resulted in significant alterations of the marine ecosystem. After March 2012, the submarine volcano Tagoro entered an active hydrothermal phase that involved a release of heat, gases, metals, and micronutrients that continues till our present. During 2016, our research team had the opportunity to participate in one of the monitoring oceanographic cruises carried out in the area in order to isolate microorganisms associated with both rock samples and deep-sea invertebrates over Tagoro submarine volcano. In this study, Proteobacteria revealed as the most abundant Phylum with 70.2% among all isolated strains, followed by Firmicutes 19%, Actinobacteria 9.5%, and Bacteroidetes 1.2%. Furthermore, we present the results of the antiproliferative assays of the extracts obtained from small-scale cultures of selected bacterial strains. An analysis of the effects of culture conditions in the antiproliferative activity showed that strains grown in Marine Broth (MB) presented lower GI50 values than those cultured in a modified medium (MM1). This effect is improved when the strains are incubated under agitation conditions. The antiproliferative potential of genera such as Halobacilus, Kangiella, Photobacterium, and Halomonas is revealed. Their biotechnological development provides an excellent starting point to access novel secondary metabolites and enzymes with potential for pharmaceutical and industrial applications.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000677855000001,10.3389/fmars.2021.687701,,#19821,Garcia-Davis 2021,,
Supplementation with vitamin D and insulin homeostasis in healthy overweight and obese adults: A randomized clinical trial,"Ebadi, SA; Sharifi, L; Rashidi, E; Ebadi, SS; Khalili, S; Sadeghi, S; Afzali, N; Shiri, SM","Introduction: Hypovitaminosis D which is a frequent problem in overweight and obese individuals, seems to interfere with cells responsible for control of glycemic status. Therefore, the current research intended to study the impact of supplementation with vitamin D on insulin homeostasis among healthy obese and overweight individuals. Methods: The current study was conducted among obese or overweight individuals who had hypovita-minosis D. After separation of participants into two groups, one group received vitamin D pearls (50,000 IU/weekly) for eight weeks, whereas another group received a placebo over the same period. Next, the level of vitamin D, fasting blood sugar (FBS), fasting insulin, Homeostasis Model Assessment 2 for Insulin Resistance (HOMA2-IR), Function of p-cell (HOMA2-p), and Insulin Sensitivity (HOMA2-S) and lipid profile of participants were evaluated. Results: Overall, 67.2% of the participants were female. No considerable difference was observed concern-ing biochemical parameters among the study groups at baseline. After eight weeks, the mean (SD) level of vitamin D was significantly lower in the placebo group than those in the vitamin D group. (38.6 +/- 8.1 vs. 14.9 +/- 6.4; P < 0.001). The patients who received vitamin D had significant lower levels of FBS (P < 0.001), fasting insulin (P < 0.001), HOMA2-IR (P < 0.001), and HOMA2-P (P = 0.03), than the placebo group. The HOMA2-S was significantly enhanced in vitamin D group, while it reduced in another group (P < 0.001). However, no considerable decrease was found in triglyceride, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein or low-density lipoprotein.

Weight change adjusted equations for assessing resting metabolic rate in overweight and obese adults,"Nachmani, M; Lahav, Y; Zeev, A; Grosman-Rimon, L; Eilat-Adar, S","Background: Although over one hundred equations have been developed to predict the energy expenditure of individuals, none are sensitive to weight change in assessment of resting metabolic rate (RMR) before and after weight loss.Objective: To formulate adjusted equations for overweight and obese individuals and to compare their accuracy with existing prediction RMR equations before and after weight loss.Subjects/materials: This is historical prospective study. Participants included 39 overweight and obese men and women before and after losing 10-20% from baseline weight on a diet and physical activity regimen for at least three months. Pre and post weight loss measured RMR results were compared to estimated RMR using several existing prediction equations: Harris and Benedict, Ravussin and Bogardus, and Mifflin et al. To improve the accuracy of these prediction equations, we suggest new equations adjusted for weight loss, based on measured RMR and evaluated their accuracy.Results: Pre and post weight loss data indicated: significant fat reduction in both genders; reduction in free-fat mass only in men, and a significant decrease in measured RMR only in women. Our suggested equations were the most accurate and closest to measured RMR in both genders, in comparison to the Harris and Benedict, Ravussin and Bogardus, and Mifflin et al equation results. Estimated RMR using the latter equations was significantly lower than measured RMR in both genders at pre and post weight loss (P < 0.01).Conclusions: This study highlights the need for adjusting RMR equations before and after weight loss in overweight and obese individuals. Further research is needed to validate our suggested equations. (c) 2021 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Metabolic syndrome screening using visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from opportunistic MRI locations in a multi-ethnic population,"Villegas-Valle, RC; Lim, U; Maskarinec, G; Franke, AA; Ernst, T; Fan, B; Alvarez-Hernandez, G; Candia-Plata, MD; Diaz-Zavala, RG; Wilkens, LR; Monroe, KR; Valencia, ME; Le Marchand, L; Shepherd, JA","Objective: To determine if visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area measured through MRI can be used opportunistically to assess the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors and compare its performance to simpler adiposity measures.Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was carried out on a subset of 1683 participants (856 women) from the Adiposity Phenotype Study (mean age = 69.2y; range 59.9-77.4). The association of total VAT area (sum of four cross sections, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5) and each location, as well as BMI and body fat % (per SD) with the metabolic syndrome (MetSx) or its components was evaluated through logistic regression analysis.Results: Total VAT can be accurately predicted using all sites evaluated (R2 range = 0.82-0.96). In men, VAT did not show a superior association to MetSx compared to BMI in men. However, in women, VAT was consistently superior to BMI and body fat % in its association to MetSx, independent of ethnicity [odds ratio for BMI, body fat %and total VAT area = 2.25 (95% CI: 1.93-2.62); 1.66 (95% CI: 1.36-2.03); 6.20 (95% CI: 4.69-8.21) respectively in all women]. Ethnic-specific odds ratios to MetSx in women ranged from 5.38 to 8.63 for total VAT area and 2.12-4.08 for BMI.Conclusion: Total VAT area can be accurately predicted from individual VAT regions in men and women and offers superior association to BMI for MetSx in women but not in men for five ethnicities. Therefore, opportunistic screening for elevated VAT area in women may be warranted across multiple ethnic groups. (C) 2021 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

Effect of Vitamin D and/or Marine n-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation on Changes in Migraine Frequency and Severity,"Rist, PM; Buring, JE; Cook, NR; Manson, JE; Kurth, T","BACKGROUND: There is interest in whether supplements, including vitamin D and marine omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids, may be effective migraine prophylaxis. However, few studies have evaluated whether vitamin D or n-3 fatty acid supplementation may reduce migraine frequency or severity.METHODS: Participants in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) were assigned to vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d) or marine n-3 fatty acid (1 g/d) supplementation in a 2-by-2 factorial design. Lifetime history of migraine was assessed a median of 4.6 years after the start of the trial. Individuals were asked to self-report changes in migraine frequency (no change, more frequent, or less frequent) and severity (no change, more severe, less severe) in the past 5 years. We used x2 tests to compare proportions of individuals reporting changes in migraine frequency and severity between active and placebo groups.RESULTS: Among the 25,871 participants in VITAL, 1032 participants had a history of probable-migraine and provided information on changes in migraine frequency and severity. The percentage of individuals reporting decreases in migraine frequency did not differ between active (69.0%) and placebo vitamin D (68.4%) (P value = 0.54) or between active (67.8%) and placebo n-3 fatty acid (69.6%) (P value = 0.82). Similarly, the percentage of individuals reporting decreases in migraine severity did not differ between active (64.1%) and placebo vitamin D (65.0%) (P value = 0.86) or between active (64.5%) and placebo n-3 fatty acid (64.5%) (P value = 0.96).CONCLUSIONS: Neither vitamin D nor marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation, compared to placebo, affected migraine frequency or severity among middle-aged or older adults.

"A governance analysis of Ningaloo and Shark Bay Marine Parks, Western Australia: Putting the 'eco' in tourism to build resilience but threatened in long-term by climate change?","Jones, PJS","The governance frameworks for Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP) and Shark Bay Marine Park (SBMP) are explored, employing the MPA governance analysis framework. Both face similar conflicts typical of ecotourism, particularly related to the impacts of recreational fishing and marine wildlife tourism. A high diversity of incentives is found to be used, the combination of which promotes effectiveness in achieving conservation objectives and equity in governance. Highly evolved regulations have provided for depleted spangled emperor (Lethrinus nebulosus) stocks in NMP to stabilise and begin recovery, and pink snapper (Pagrus auratus) stocks in SBMP to recover from past depletions, though there are still concerns about recreational fishing impacts. The governance frameworks for marine wildlife tourism are considered extremely good practice. Some incentives need strengthening in both cases, particularly capacity for enforcement, penalties for deterrence and crossjurisdictional coordination. In NMP there was also a need to promote transparency in making research and monitoring results available, and to address tensions with the recreational fishing sector by building linkages to provide for their specific representation, as part of a strategy to build trust and cooperation with this sector. Both case studies represent world-leading good practice in addressing proximal impacts from local activities, but in the longer-term the foundation species of both marine parks are critically threatened by the distal impacts of climate change. A diversity of incentives has promoted resilience in the short-term, but global action to mitigate climate change is the only way to promote the long-term resilience of these iconic marine ecosystems.",2021,,MARINE POLICY,127,,,WOS:000663338400003,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103636,,#19826,Jones 2021,,
2018 worldwide survey of health-care providers caring for patients with narcolepsy WSS narcolepsy task force,"Rosenthal, L; Thorpy, MJ; Nevsimalova, S; Mayer, G; Han, F; Dauvilliers, Y","Background: There are limited data available on regional differences in the diagnosis and management of narcolepsy. In order to better understand worldwide trends in clinical assessment and management of narcolepsy, a survey of health-care providers was conducted by the World Sleep Society Narcolepsy task force.Methods: A total of 146 surveys that included items on the diagnosis and management of narcolepsy were completed by practitioners representing 37 countries.Results: Most of the participants were from Europe, North America, Oceania, Asia and Latin America. A consistent approach to applying the diagnostic criteria of Narcolepsy was documented with the exception of measurement of CSF hypocretin-1, which has limited availability. While the majority of practitioners (58%) reported not using the test, 1% indicated always evaluating CSF hypocretin-1 levels. There was much variability in the availability of currently recommended medications such as sodium oxybate and pitolisant; modafinil and antidepressants were the most commonly used medications. Amphetamines were unavailable in some countries.Conclusion: The results of the study highlight clinical and therapeutic realities confronted by worldwide physicians in the management of narcolepsy. While the diagnostic criteria of narcolepsy rely in part on the quantification of CSF hypocretin-1, few physicians reported having incorporated this test into their routine assessment of the condition. Regional differences in the management of narcolepsy appeared to be related to geographic availability and expense of the therapeutic agents. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Quantification and exposure assessment of microplastics in Australian indoor house dust,"Soltani, NS; Taylor, MP; Wilson, SP","Limited attention has been given to the presence of MPs in the atmospheric environment, particularly in indoor environments where people spend about 90% of their time. This study quantitatively assesses the prevalence, source and type of MPs in Australian homes with the goal of evaluating human health exposure potential. Thirty-two airborne indoor deposited dust samples were collected in glass Petri dishes from Sydney (Australia) homes, over a one-month period in 2019. Participants completed a questionnaire on their household characteristics. Samples were analysed using a stereomicroscope, a fluorescent microscope and micro-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for their colour, size, shape and composition. Inhalation and ingestion rates were modelled using US EPA exposure factors. Microplastic fibre deposition rates ranged from 22 to 6169 fibres/m(2)/day. Deposited dust comprised 99% fibres. The highest proportion of fibres (19%) were 200-400 mm in length. The majority were natural (42%); 18% were transformed natural-based fibres; and 39% were petrochemical based. A significant difference was observed between the deposition rate and the main floor covering (p-value <0.05). Polyethylene, polyester, polyamide, polyacrylic, and polystyrene fibres were found in higher abundance in homes with carpet as the main floor covering. Where carpet was absent, polyvinyl fibres were the most dominant petrochemical fibre type, indicating the role of flooring materials (e.g. wood varnishes) in determining MP composition. Vacuum cleaner use was significantly related to MP deposition rates (p value <0.05). MP ingestion rates peaked at 6.1 mg/kg-B-w/year for ages 1-6, falling to a minimum of 0.5 mg/kg-B-w/year in >20 years age group. Mean inhaled MP weight and count was determined to be 0.2 +/- 0.07 mg/kg-B-w/year and 12891 +/- 4472 fibres/year. Greatest inhalation intake rates were for the <0.5-yr age group, at 0.31 mg/kg-B-w/year. The study data reveal that MPs are prevalent in Australian homes and that the greatest risk of exposure resides with young children. Notwithstanding the limited number of global studies and the different methods used to measure MPs, this study indicates Australian deposition and inhalation rates are at the lower end of the exposure spectrum.

Socio-economic prospects and problems in under-exploited offshore marine fisheries: The case of Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) in Kenya coastal fisheries,"Onyango, HO; Ochiewo, JO; Karani, NJ","Existing fishing methods and traditional vessels used by artisanal fishers in Kenya coast confine them to overfished sheltered reef areas and are not efficient enough to harvest a scattered resource. Fish Aggregation Devices (FADs) have been proposed as a new technological frontier with better prospects for capture of high valued fish species like tuna, thus improving income to coastal fishers. However, the reception of this technology by artisanal fishers has not been assessed in spite of implementation of various experimental FADs projects in the region. This study provides socio-economics insights with which to view the current status of Kenya's FADs fishery. Survey data was collected through a combination of questionnaires and participant observations. Results reveal that fishing activities are still undertaken within the shallow protected waters of the barrier reef by artisans who operate small non-mechanized crafts. Fishing time is still relatively high (7hrs/day) even though the most prevalent gear is the traditional basket trap (43%). The modal daily income for fishers averaged at KES 400 (similar to US$3.9). Only 13% of the fishers were adequately aware of FADs, among whom, FAD fishers who had been engaged in previous experimental projects rated FADs as highly effective (72%). The shortcomings of FADs included: increase in theft and vandalism of equipment (50%), attraction of illegal fishers (25%), and fisher-fisher conflicts due to little sensitization. Overall, fishers viewed FADs projects as unsustainable, since the required expertise is scarce while the equipment is expensive. We recommend the need for development of a user-right friendly approach to communal fishing offered by the FADs framework, and the fabrication of these FADs from locally available materials in order to enable fishers and local industry to run and advance the technology.

"Pregestational obesity, maternal morbidity and risk of caesarean delivery in a country in an advanced stage of obstetric transition","Escobar, MBC; Contreras, JO; Bertoglia, MP; Bannout, MA","Objective: To evaluate whether pregestational obesity is associated with the risk of caesarean section in pregnant women living in a country in an advanced stage of the obstetric transition.Methods: Retrospective cohort study. Data were collected from prenatal and hospital records. Pregestational obesity was defined as: body mass index, [weight(k)/height (m(2))] >= 30, and caesarean sections were categorized as elective, emergency, or non-emergency/medically necessary. Biodemographic and sociodemographic characteristics, obstetric and perinatal pathologies, and maternal anthropometric variables were assessed. Chi-square and t-tests were used to compare qualitative and quantitative variables, respectively. Simple and adjusted generalized linear models were used to evaluate the association between pregestational obesity and caesarean delivery. Finally, population attributable risk was calculated. Data analysis was performed using STATA.v.14.0.Participants: 2309 pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy who gave birth at a public hospital in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, Chile in 2015.Results: The prevalence of pregestational obesity was 21.4%, and the incidence of caesarean deliveries was 34.8% (33% of which corresponded to elective, 46% to emergency, and 21% to non-emergency/medically necessary caesarean deliveries). Pregestational obesity increased the risk of caesarean delivery (aRR = 1.46; 95%CI. [1.19-1.79] as well as the risk of elective (aRR = 1.74; 95%CI. [1.23-2.45]) and emergency caesarean delivery (aRR = 1.44; 95%CI. [1.03-2.00]). The population attributable risk of pregestational obesity for caesarean section was 32%.Conclusion: Given the significant association between pregestational obesity and caesarean delivery, it is necessary to develop strategies to decrease obesity among women of childbearing age in order to decrease obstetric intervention.

"The use of anti-obesity medications in people with mental illness as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions - Effectiveness, tolerability and impact on eating behaviours: A 52-week observational study","Tham, M; Terence, WH; Jenkins, ZM; Castle, DJ","Objective: The increasing prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in people with mental illness (MI) is a global health priority. Anti-obesity medications (AOMs) may help with reducing medication induced hunger and weight gain when lifestyle changes are insufficient. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability, impact on eating behaviours and psychiatric safety of AOMs in this population.Methods: We conducted an observational study of 244 adults with MI with at least two risk factors for metabolic syndrome attending an obesity management clinic. Participants received standardised diet, exercise and psychological care, in addition to AOMs tailored to each participant's circumstances. Baseline and 12-month assessments encompassing physical, metabolic and psychological parameters were compared.Results: Over the course of the study, the average weight loss was 11.79 kg (12.1%), decrease in BMI was 3.90 kg/m(2) and reduction in waist circumference was 12.6 cm. Participants with good glycaemic control increased from 28.6% to 80.7%, hypercholesterolaemia reduced from 85.2%-29.9% and hypertension rates reduced from 88.9%-52.0%. Depression, anxiety and stress levels for the sample decreased significantly (all p < .01). Eating behaviours improved (all p < .001) at follow-up. Psychiatric side effects including deterioration of mood (28.2%) and suicidality (30.8%) were primarily experienced by those on topiramate.Conclusions: AOMs can be effective in achieving clinically meaningful weight loss, improved metabolic co-morbidities and eating behaviours in people living with MI, when combined with a comprehensive lifestyle program. The majority of AOMs are well tolerated but topiramate appears more likely to negatively impact mental health. (C) 2020 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Blood mercury and plasma polychlorinated biphenyls concentrations in pregnant Inuit women from Nunavik: Temporal trends, 1992-2017","Adamou, TY; Riva, M; Muckle, G; Sidi, EAL; Lemire, M; Ayotte, P","The Inuit of Nunavik (Northern Quebec, Canada) are exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury (Hg) through their consumption of marine country foods. A temporal trend study was initiated in 1992 to monitor circulating levels of PCBs and Hg in pregnant Inuit women, since the fetus is most at risk of adverse health effects. We set out (1) to describe temporal trends of PCBs and Hg levels in pregnant Nunavik women between 1992 and 2017; (2) to determine the prevalence of participants exceeding the guidance values in 2017; (3) to investigate relations between marine country food intake and contaminant levels over the study period. A total of 559 pregnant women provided a blood sample for contaminant analysis from 1992 to 2017. PCB congeners were quantified in plasma (serum) by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to electron capture detection or mass spectrometry (MS). We determined whole blood mercury concentration by cold vapor atomic absorption inductively-coupled plasma MS. We performed multilevel modeling to assess temporal trends in contaminant levels and relations with marine country food consumption. Concentrations of total PCBs and Hg decreased by 84% and 65% between 1992 and 2017, respectively. Nevertheless, 10% and 22% of women in 2017 exceeded guidance values for PCBs and Hg, respectively. While the decline in marine country food intake is the only factor associated with decreasing Hg levels, other factors may explain the decline in PCB levels. Despite the significant decline in PCBs and Hg levels from 1992 to 2017, exposure to these contaminants is still quite prevalent among pregnant Nunavik women. Most of the decline in Hg exposure is likely due to a shift away from marine country foods to store-bought foods, which is a concern given the cultural and nutritional importance of country foods and the high food insecurity that prevails in Nunavik.

Validity of the pediatric simple metabolic syndrome score,"Lee, YJ; Seo, MY; Kim, SH; Park, MJ","Aims: To compare the validity of the conventional continuous metabolic syndrome score (ccMS) and pediatric simple metabolic syndrome score (PsiMS) for the prediction of MS in Korean adolescents. Methods: A total of 2983 adolescents aged 10-18 years who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013-2017) were enrolled. The ccMS was calculated by aggregating the sex and age-specific z-scores of body mass index, systolic blood pressure (SBP), glucose, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. The PsiMS was calculated using the following formula: 2x(waist/height (cm) + glucose (mg/dL)/100 + triglycerides (mg/dL)/150 + SBP (mmHg)/130 HDL-C (mg/dL)/40 .Results: Mean PsiMS was significantly higher in subjects with MS compared with those without MS (3.24 vs. 1.93 in boys, 3.11 vs. 1.80 in girls; P < 0.001). Both ccMS and PsiMS were significantly higher in subjects with more MS components compared to adolescents with fewer components (P-for-trend<0.001). Among the adolescents without MS but in the PsiMS quintile 5, 33.5% presented two or more MS components. The receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated an equally good performance of ccMS (AUC = 0.975) and PsiMS (AUC = 0.958) for identifying adolescent MS risk. PsiMS showed a good stratification of MS risk in the generalized linear model.Conclusion: PsiMS is an accurate and efficient scoring system to assess and monitor the risk of adolescent MS in the research and clinical practice.

The Ecological Protection and Tourism Exploitation of Coast Resources in Macau,"Ding, H; Dai, JW; Jiang, XY","With the support of the Chinese government, the marine area of Macau has been further defined and enlarged, resulting in the rich and premium coast resources. Correspondingly, the Macau government should not only attach crucial importance to the coast resources, but also promote the ecological protection and exploit tourism. Based on the features of Macau's coast resources, the authors of this essay propose that in order to protect the coast resources and ecological environment successfully, the Macau government should create the landscape ecology texture between city and coast, keep full control of pollution sources as well as perfect integrated monitoring system, conduct research on the ecological protection of natural reserves and wetland park, and enhance the education of environment conservation. It is suggested that based on ecological protection and in order to make full use of the opportunity to change Macau into 'the center of tourism and entertainment in the world', top-level design is required and the tourism projects and products that integrates gambling industry, shopping, and cultural heritage should be created. In the meantime, the government, enterprises and relevant organizations should launch more projects and programs of leisure vacations and study travels, develop its tourism by cooperating fully with Hong Kong and other cities around Macau. In the future, the 'win-win' goal of protecting and exploiting coast resources could be achieved.",2020,,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,,,4-Jan,WOS:000576681900001,10.2112/JCR-SI110-001.1,,#19835,Ding 2020,,
Trajectories of depressive symptoms and relationships with weight loss in the seven years after bariatric surgery,"Smith, KE; Mason, TB; Cao, L; Crosby, RD; Steffen, KJ; Garcia, L; King, WC; Mitchell, JE","While depression generally improves after bariatric surgery, less is known regarding heterogeneity in long-term symptom change. Given that depressive symptoms have been associated with weight change following bariatric surgery, identifying and characterizing subgroups with more severe depressive symptoms may have prognostic utility for understanding post-surgical weight loss. This study sought to characterize patterns of change in depressive symptoms and evaluate associations with weight loss in the seven years following bariatric surgery.Methods: Participants were 2308 patients who underwent bariatric surgery as part of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study. Depressive symptoms (measured by the Beck Depression Inventory) and weight were assessed annually following surgery.Results: A group-based trajectory model identified six subgroups that evidenced distinct patterns of change in depressive symptoms, with the majority (87.0%) exhibiting stable low to average levels. Generalized linear mixed models indicated trajectory groups differed in percent total weight loss (%TWL), with trajectories characterized by initial decreases in depressive symptoms over the first two years (5.2% of participants) experiencing the highest %TWL (20.7% vs. 14.9-18.4% in the other trajectories at 7 years).Conclusions: Findings demonstrate meaningful heterogeneity in the pattern of changes in depressive symptoms after surgery. While most patients experience relatively low stable levels of depressive symptoms, those who have initial symptom improvement demonstrate the greatest magnitude of weight loss. Further research is necessary to explore the directionality of this association and the time-varying mechanisms by which depression and weight may mutually influence each other.

Visceral fat metabolic activity evaluated by F-18-FDG PET/CT is associated with osteoporosis in healthy postmenopausal Korean women,"Pahk, K; Kwon, Y; Kim, MK; Park, S; Kim, S","Background: Traditionally, obesity has been regarded as protective against osteoporosis. However, recent accumulating evidences suggest that visceral obesity can increase the risk of osteoporosis and obesity-driven dysfunctional metabolic activity in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is considered as a key underlying mechanism. Visceral obesity is known to increase during menopausal transition. F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-18-FDG PET/CT) is an established method to assess the degree of VAT metabolic activity. We aimed to investigate the association between VAT metabolic activity evaluated by F-18-FDG PET/CT and osteoporosis in healthy postmenopausal Korean women.Methods: A total of 115 postmenopausal women who underwent routine health check-up were enrolled in this study, retrospectively. They all underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and F-18-FDG PET/CT. Osteoporosis was defined as bone mineral density (BMD) T-score = -2.5 at either lumbar spine or femoral neck. VAT metabolic activity was defined as the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of VAT divided by the SUVmax of subcutaneous adipose tissue (V/S ratio).Results: The participants with osteoporosis showed significantly higher V/S ratio, age, body mass index, waist circumference, and postmenopausal period than the participants without osteoporosis. V/S ratio of 1.33 was proposed as an optimal cut-off value for identifying osteoporosis. Furthermore, V/S ratio was the most significant predictive factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal woman by uni-and multivariate analyses. Interestingly, V/S ratio showed significant positive correlation with high sensitivity C-reactive protein, a surrogate marker for systemic inflammation.Conclusion: VAT metabolic activity assessed by F-18-FDG PET/CT is associated with osteoporosis in healthy postmenopausal Korean women.

Understanding students' perception of sustainability in architecture education: A comparison among universities in three different continents,"Boarin, P; Martinez-Molina, A; Juan-Ferruses, I","Educational institutions around the globe have taken definitive steps to curtail the increasing dependence on energy in the built environment by promoting the education of sustainability-minded professionals. Since a large portion of the global energy dependence can be attributed to the building sector, integrating sustainability coursework within the curricula of architecture programmes is a logical development. This study takes a step forward in understanding how different architectural programmes implement sustainability education within their respective curricula. The research team investigated research-focussed and professionally-accredited undergraduate and postgraduate architectural programmes offered by three tertiary education providers in different continents (Oceania, Europe and North America) and assessed their respective impacts on student designs in regard to sustainability considerations. The researchers collected and analysed over 300 student opinions and evaluated their correlation with the educational programmes offered by the institutions through a mapping, an analysis and a comparison activity on the implementation of sustainability-related topics and courses. Results show that nearly all of the participating students generally consider sustainability a key aspect of their education; however, the particularities of student opinions with respect to sustainability outcomes in designs largely vary and seem to depend on the goals and design focus of each programme. This better understanding of the effects produced by the depth and distribution of courses across architecture curricula contributes to the assessment of teaching approaches and learning outcomes from the three universities against the global trends and, therefore, to support ongoing and future curriculum development activities.

Evaluating the association of free sugars intake and glycemic load on cardiometabolic outcomes: A prospective analysis throughout adolescence into early adulthood,"Marinho, AR; Severo, M; Ramos, E; Lopes, C","Purpose: To prospectively evaluate the relation of free sugars intake and glycemic load with adiposity and insulin resistance, from adolescence into early adulthood.Methods: Data from the population-based cohort EPITeen (Porto, Portugal) at 13 and 21 years old was used (n = 1034). At both ages, dietary assessment was obtained by food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). Added sugar of each food item was estimated based on a systematic methodology described by Louie et al. Free sugars (FS) were defined according to World Health Organization. To each food item of the FFQ, a calculated mean value of FS and glycemic index was assigned. Dietary glycemic load (GL) was determined for each participant. Sex- and age-specific body mass index z-score (BMIz) and waist-to-weight ratio (WWr) were used as measures of adiposity, and the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) as a measure of insulin resistance. A cross-lagged path analysis was performed to examine causal relationships between FS intake or dietary GL with BMIz, WWr or HOMA-IR.Results: No significant association was found between intake of FS and dietary GL at 13 years with BMIz, WWr or HOMA-IR at 21. A significant inverse association was found between BMIz at 13 and FS (beta = -0.595,95%CI -0.830, -0.359) and dietary GL (beta = -0.687,95%CI -0.937,-0.437) at 21 years. Intake of FS, dietary GL, as well as BMIz, WWr and HOMA-IR tracked from 13 to 21 years.Conclusion: No significant association was found between consumption of FS and GL at 13 years with cardiometabolic features at 21 years.

Effect of 8-weeks intensive lifestyle intervention on LDL and HDL subfractions,"Bajer, B; Radikova, Z; Havranova, A; Zitnanova, I; Vlcek, M; Imrich, R; Sabaka, P; Bendzala, M; Penesova, A","Objective: Atherogenic dyslipidemia is a cardinal feature of obesity and the metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Many interventional studies, describing the influence of weight loss on cardiometabolic risks, are bariatric surgery studies. The aim of our study was to analyze the effect of intensive lifestyle changes on LDL- and HDL-cholesterol subfractions and cardiometabolic risk factors in obese subjects.Methods: A group of 41 patients with obesity (11M/30F; 44.1 +/- 12.4 years; BMI 30.2 +/- 6.3 kg/m(2)) participated in an 8-week weight loss interventional program (NCT02325804), consisting of caloric intake reduced by 30% and physical activity (150 min/week). Insulin sensitivity was evaluated according to the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and physical fitness was measured using bicycle ergometry. Lipid subfractions were measured using the Lipoprint system (Quantimetrix Corp., CA, USA).Results: After the intervention, body weight was reduced by 5.4 +/- 4.5 kg, as well as body fat mass and waist circumference. Physical fitness improved, systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart rate decreased after the intervention. Insulin sensitivity improved after the intervention. Total, LDL, HDL cholesterol, as well as triglycerides decreased after the intervention. Regarding the lipoprotein subfractions, LDL2 and small HDL subfractions decreased, while others have not changed.Conclusion: Eight weeks of diet and physical activity intervention led to weight and fat mass loss and induced improvement of insulin sensitivity, as well as atheroprotective changes of lipid profile.

This study aimed to identify and prioritise activities for future work of the Joint Effort Initiative.Design: A survey was emailed to delegates of the 2018 OARSI World Congress attending a pre-conference workshop or with a known interest in OAMPs (n = 115). Delegates were asked about the most important issues regarding OAMP implementation. The top 20 issues were synthesised into 17 action statements, and respondents were invited to participate in a priority ranking exercise to determine the order of importance of the statements.Results: Survey respondents (n = 51, 44%) were most commonly female (71%), with an allied health background (57%), affiliated with universities (73%) from Oceania (37%), and Europe/UK (45%). The five highest ranked action statements were:i) Establish guidelines for the implementation of different OAMP models to ensure consistency of delivery and adherence to international best practice.ii) Develop and assess training and education programs for health care professionals (HCPs) delivering OAMPs.iii) Develop and evaluate the implementation and outcomes of novel models of OAMPs.iv) Develop and assess core skill sets and resources for HCPs delivering OA care.v) Develop a framework for enhancing the quality of care provided by OAMPs.Conclusion: Prioritising statements will bring focus to the future work of the Joint Effort Initiative in the future and provide a basis for longer-term actions.

Telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy for female patients 1-year post-bariatric surgery: A pilot study,"Sockalingam, S; Leung, SE; Hawa, R; Wnuk, S; Parikh, SV; Jackson, T; Cassin, SE","Objective: Although bariatric surgery is a durable treatment for patients with severe obesity, it does not directly address behavioural and psychological factors that potentially contribute to weight regain post-surgery. Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), can be challenging to access due to physical limitations and practical barriers. Telephone-based CBT (Tele-CBT) can improve eating psychopathology and psychological distress before and after surgery. Given the frequent occurrence/recurrence of problematic eating-related and psychological issues many patients face 1-year post-surgery, this open-trial pilot study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Tele-CBT delivered 1-year post-surgery as an adjunctive treatment to the usual standard of bariatric care.Methods: Patients (n=43) received six 1-h Tele-CBT sessions delivered weekly beginning at 1-year post-surgery. Patients completed questionnaire packages before and after the intervention to assess changes in binge eating (BES), emotional eating (EES), depression (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7).Results: Thirty-two patients completed Tele-CBT yielding a 74.4% completion rate. Participants reported significant improvements on the Binge Eating Scale (t(31) = 3.794, p= 0.001), Emotional Eating Scale (t(31)= 3.508, p= 0.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item Scale (z = -2.371, p= 0.018), and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 Item Scale (z = -3.546, p< 0.001) immediately following Tele-CBT.Discussion: The results demonstrate that Tele-CBT delivered 1-year post-surgery may improve binge eating, emotional eating, depression, and anxiety. Additional research is warranted to examine whether these changes translate into long-term improvements in bariatric surgery outcomes. (C) 2019 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

Problems and prospects of revitalizing marine pearl cultivation in highly urbanized coasts: A case study of Tolo Harbour in Hong Kong,"Yan, WT; Lau, CP; Leung, KMY; Davies, SNG","Pearl farming is part of Hong Kong's maritime heritage. Its history in the territory can be traced back irregularly for over a millennium, focussed on what was then known as the Tai Po Sea (now Tolo Harbour (Tolo Gang). For a short period in the 10th century AD Southern Han (during the turbulent Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, the pearl farming became a tightly guarded Imperial monopoly. Thereafter the detail is uncertain but pearl fishing would seem to have continued, if not on a large scale, until the British annexation of the New Territories in 1898, although the centre of gravity, focussed on edible oysters, had moved to Deep Bay. An attempt was made to begin a cultivated pearl industry in Tolo Harbour in the 1960s but it failed. In this paper we seek to reconstruct the history of that episode and reveal the reasons why the ventures failed based on interviews with participants, newspaper clippings, government records and records kept by the Hong Kong Heritage Project. Despite government support, key failings were an inability to find the way to cultivate oysters in Hong Kong and a deficiency of wild pearl oysters available for grafting. Based on this historical lesson, the feasibility of revitalizing the pearl cultivation industry in highly urbanized coastal cities like Hong Kong, including improvements to water quality via biofiltration, are evaluated and discussed. Some recommendations are made for enabling the industry to be viable and sustainable. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Decision framework for ocean thermal energy plant site selection from a sustainability perspective: The case of China,"Zhang, JY; Xu, CB; Song, ZX; Huang, Y; Wu, YN","Site selection is a key factor to the success of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) project. It is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem with a series of conflicting criteria involved. However, limited studies were found concerning this area and problems existing in classical MCDM methods tended to fail OTEC site selection decisions. Therefore, this paper proposes an extended MCDM method and establishes a new decision-making framework to select the optimal location. First, a comprehensive evaluation criteria system for OTEC site selection from the view of sustainability with 16 criteria involved is established. Second, feasible alternative sites for OTEC project are identified by PEST analysis. Third, an extended PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation) under intuitionistic fuzzy environment is proposed to avoid compensation assumptions. During the decision process, seven groups of experts shared the work and cooperated with each other according to their backgrounds. Finally, a real case is studied and sensitive analysis is conducted, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method. This study can effectively improve OTEC site selection decision making quality and also extends the domains of intuitionistic fuzzy PROMETHEE applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

"Neighbourhood socioeconomic circumstances, adiposity and cardiometabolic risk measures in children with severe obesity","Juonala, M; Harcourt, BE; Saner, C; Sethi, M; Saffery, R; Magnussen, CG; Burgner, DP; Sabin, MA","Background: It has recently been shown that neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood is associated with obesity, hypertension, fatty liver, and type 2 diabetes in adulthood. However, it is largely unknown whether neighbourhood socioeconomic circumstances are important predictors of adiposity and associated measures in children, especially in those with severe obesity. Therefore, we evaluated the associations between neighbourhood socioeconomic factors with the severity of obesity, and related cardiometabolic risk factors in a cohort of obese children.Methods: The Childhood Overweight BioRepository of Australia (COBRA) cohort study comprises 444 children (mean age 11.1 years, mean BMI z-score 2.5). Neighbourhood socioeconomic advantage/disadvantage was evaluated based on postcode information by the national Australian Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) scores. Participants/parents also completed self-administered questionnaires on neighbourhood related facilities, family education and family income.Results: In analyses adjusted for age, sex and pubertal status, SEIFA indicating neighbourhood education/occupation was negatively associated with BMI, waist circumference and body fat%. Higher family education was associated with lower BMI. Neighbourhood walkability was related to lower waist circumference. Good shopping facilities in the neighbourhood were associated with increased risk of dyslipidemia and fatty liver, and the existence of parks and playgrounds nearby was related to dyslipidemia.Conclusions: The present data suggest that neighbourhood-related issues are associated with less severe adiposity among children with established obesity. Concerning cardiometabolic risk factors, shopping facilities were related to dyslipidemia and fatty liver. These findings suggest that increased awareness and efforts are needed to diminish socioeconomic inequalities between neighbourhoods. (C) 2019 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

Male partners of subfertile couples in which the spouse is obese display adverse weight and lifestyle associated with reduced sperm quality,"Belan, M; Carranza-Mamane, B; Pesant, MH; AinMelk, Y; Duval, K; Jean-Denis, F; Langlois, MF; Baillargeon, JP","Objectives: To assess: 1-the spousal concordance of lifestyle and anthropometric characteristics between partners of infertile couples in which the woman is obese; and 2-in men, the influence of these characteristics on their conventional seminal parameters.Design: Cross-sectional study.Setting: Fertility clinic of the Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke, Canada, between January 2012 and February 2015.Patients: 97 infertile heterosexual couples in which women were obese and seeking fertility treatments.Intervention: Not applicable.Main outcome measures: Weight and percentage of fat mass were evaluated using a scale with foot-to-foot bio-impedance. Abdominal obesity was estimated with waist circumference and lifestyle habits, by a self-reported questionnaire. Seminal parameters were analysed and collected according to the WHO guidelines (Kruger's strict criteria for seminal morphology).Results: There was a significant spousal concordance for the percentage of fat mass, leisure activities and overall nutritional quality. Accordingly, male participants displayed anthropometric and lifestyle characteristics at higher risk than Canadian men of similar age. Moreover, BMI, daily consumption of fruits & vegetables and sleeping hours in men were independently associated to the total motile sperm count.Conclusion: This is the first study to report concordance for anthropometric and lifestyle characteristics between partners of infertile couples in which the woman is obese. These characteristics in men were more adverse than in the general population and were associated with reduced sperm quality. Altogether, our results suggest that male partners of infertile couples could benefit from participating in the lifestyle intervention that is already recommended for their spouse affected by obesity.Capsule: Because partners of subfertile couples in which the woman is obese share adverse anthropometric and lifestyle characteristics, male partners should be implicated in lifestyle interventions already indicated for their spouse.

"Assessment of coastal turbidity improvement potential by terrigenous sediment load reduction and its implications on seagrass inhabitable area in Banate Bay, central Philippines","Yamamoto, T; Malingin, MACL; Pepino, MM; Yoshikai, M; Campos, W; Miyajima, T; Watanabe, A; Tanaka, Y; Morimoto, N; Ramos, R; Pagkalinawan, H; Nadaoka, K","This paper demonstrates the effects of terrigenous sediment load reduction by watershed managements on coastal turbidity in Banate Bay, Iloilo located in central Philippines, using field observations and numerical simulations. Measurements of the total suspended solid and particulate organic carbon indicated that the bulk component of the coastal turbidity comprised terrigenous mineral particles rather than phytoplankton at the rise of the river after heavy rain. The suspended sediment concentration and underwater light intensity were simulated by an atmosphere-watershed-coastal ocean model to investigate the contribution of the terrigenous sediment load to the coastal turbidity in rainy season. The coastal sediment simulation indicated that the turbidity in Banate Bay is highly impacted by terrigenous sediment inputs from distant watersheds, which are transported to the bay by coastal currents. In contrast, the contributions of sediment loads from the adjacent watersheds to the bay turbidity were limited. The simulation also indicated that the majority of the bay is not inhabitable for seagrasses due to limited light availability caused by the high turbidity. Scenario analysis of the sediment load reduction demonstrated that significant reduction of turbidity and improvement of light penetration are conditionally expected only when the remediation is implemented with cooperative management of a series of neighboring watersheds because of the significant contributions of sediment loads from multiple basins.

Mobile health applications enhance weight loss efficacy following bariatric surgery,"Mangieri, CW; Johnson, RJ; Sweeney, LB; Choi, YU; Wood, JC","Introduction: With the epidemic of obesity numerous mobile health (mHealth) applications have been designed with the goal of facilitating weight loss. This technology has the potential to focus behavioral modification in a manner that's effective for weight loss. We examined the use of this mHealth technology in our bariatric surgery population to evaluate effects on weight loss following surgery.Methods: Single institution prospective randomized control trial performed at an academic center. 56 patients who recently underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) were enrolled into a control group with standard post-operative monitoring and a mHealth application group provided with iPad (c) minis with the MyFitnessPal (c) mHealth application. Participants were followed for 24 months. The primary outcomes were effect on weight loss as determined by excess body weight loss (%EWL) and excess BMI loss (%EBL).Results: Statistically significant differences in weight loss outcomes between the groups were present throughout the duration of the study. At 12 months, % EWL was 74.41% (control) vs 81.41% (mHealth) p value 0.047 and at 24 months, it was 59.10% (control) vs 71.47% (mHealth) p value 0.0078. % EBL findings at 12 months was 28.02% (control) vs 32.15% (mHealth) p value 0.0007 and at 24 months, it was 25.39% (control) vs 27.87% (mHealth) p value 0.048.Conclusion: Our results demonstrate mHealth applications are a useful adjunct to improve and maintain weight loss following bariatric surgery. We suggest mHealth applications should be utilized following bariatric surgery for improved outcomes. (C) 2019 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Recognizing major trends of change in coastal ecosystems and the importance of the linkages among them, our goal was to monitor synoptically with standardized methods the physical environment and to document trends in measures of the structure and functioning of coral reefs, seagrasses and mangroves. Between 1985 and 1993, the CARICOMP Steering Committee established a data management center and wrote a methods manual. Marine laboratories joined the program by appointing a Site Director and signing an agreement specifying the cost sharing and responsibilities of the laboratory. With significant outside funding in 1992, the program became fully functional and ultimately more than 30 institutions in 21 Caribbean countries participated. Monitoring lasted from 1992 to 2007, spanning many technological advances including the internet, automated in situ data logging and remote sensing. Annual CARICOMP meetings, organized at a different laboratory each year, were essential in standardization of methods and maintaining interest. Open access to the data was a goal from the start, although the members imposed an embargo to allow time to publish major results. At some of the sites, monitoring continues to this day, generating among the longest coastal monitoring data sets in the Caribbean, and possibly in the world. Over time, multi-authored papers were prepared for the Proceedings of the International Coral Reef Symposia and other journals, and independent scientists drew on the open database for regional analyses of ecosystem trends. Recently, active members have written summary papers based on the monitoring data covering physical parameters, coral reefs, seagrasses, and mangroves. Overall, the data reveal major differences across the region and changing rates and trends showing the dynamism and vulnerability of coastal ecosystems. The longer the monitoring continues, the more valuable the dataset becomes as a tool to discern the underlying factors driving the structure and functioning of Caribbean coastal ecosystems. Several recent workshops have concluded that the need for regionally cooperative monitoring and research has never been greater.",2019,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,5,,,WOS:000587335900001,10.3389/fmars.2018.00519,,#19852,Cortes 2019,,
MAKING INFORMAL LEARNING VISIBLE THROUGH BADGES: CASE STUDY OF BERLENGAS UNESCO BIOSPHERE RESERVE,"Mouga, T; Santos, MN; Lopes, MS; Moiteiro, G; Gamboa, R","Tourists visit a natural park or a museum for leisure, but in the meantime they also learn. Learning happens everywhere. Thus, the BADGES perspective is to give visibility to this informal leaning in heritage sites and increase the learning depth using an APP in the mobile phone, reflective questions and games as learning and validation tools. The final step is the issuing of a digital Badge to make the learning visible. This is the main idea behind the BADGES Erasmus strategic partnership project.The cultural & heritage sector will also benefit from the Badges approach because they gain visibility and importance in the sector of live long learning. Validation of learning in cultural sites can improve people's confidence, curiosity and motivation to learn more. Through inducting reflective thinking, using intriguing issues, people will become increasingly engaged and more participative in social and heritage related activities.The BADGES project developed a methodological frame that creates conditions for competence based non-formal/informal learning in cultural/heritage contexts. Inspired in the LEVEL 5 methodology of learning with the Head (Knowledge), the Hand (Skills) and the Heart (Attitudes) the Badges project defined a learning path for cultural & heritage sites with an easy, intermediate and advanced level for each dimension and competence. Then, test pilots were developed for different heritage/museum contexts and an online system for assessing the competence development of cultural learners was developed. First pilot was tested during the Loon exposition in the Belgian castle of Alden Biesen, in September 2018. Pilots were also developed for Torres Vedras municipal museum regarding the Napoleonic War, for the windmill heritage in the Netherlands (Schiedam) and for the Berlengas' Island UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in Portugal, among others. This paper will address this last example.The Berlengas project is related to sustainable use of protected marine areas. Main goal is to develop environmental awareness in tourists that visit the island, getting their attention to some important issues like: Island environment problems (water, energy, garbage, invasive species), the nursery effect, the endemic species and sustainable tourism in the island.Target group and learning path were defined and the implementation of a mobile application was made. Simple questions were used to decide the type of information to provide to the visitor, simple mobile games were implemented to develop knowledge and some intriguing themes and dilemmas were also used to induce reflective learning. The mobile application was developed using the Moodle learning management system and H5P activities.Two important points mark the visiting experience: before the visit to the island, people can prepare themselves with the help of the mobile application. First part shows some of the species that can be found on the trip but also gives some environmental advices on important attitudes. After the visit people can reflect on what they have seen and on the main problems of the island with games and the presentation of dilemmas and intriguing issues.If people reach to a specific stage of knowledge than a digital badge is issued with information about the achieved competence and the local where they were developed.Badges project main objective is, therefore, to disseminate the concept of recognizing long life learning acquired during leisure activities and build a network of heritage/cultural sites that can use this approach, contributing to make the learning visible while people enjoy heritage.",2019,,"12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI 2019)",,,5543-5550,WOS:000530109205095,,,#19853,Mouga 2019,,
Addressing environmental impact assessment challenges in Pacific island countries for effective management of deep sea minerals activities,"Bradley, M; Swaddling, A","Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an important instrument for management of deep sea minerals (DSM) activities in the Pacific islands region. However, effective EIA application is likely to be impeded by four challenges common among Pacific island countries: (1) human resource shortfalls; (2) insufficient quality control exercised over EIA reports; (3) weak compliance monitoring and enforcement; and (4) low levels of public engagement and participation in EIA. This paper identifies options for addressing the challenges, to improve EIA implementation and to ensure DSM activities are subject to appropriate regulation and oversight. Risks may be faced if the challenges are not addressed, including, failure to meet environmental management and governance obligations; loss of confidence in the regulatory system; environmental harm; and discouragement of sustainable development and investment. Pacific island countries that choose to engage with the DSM sector must apply EIA rigorously arid continually work at improving their EIA systems, if they seek to maximise positive development outcomes and to minimise adverse effects on other marine users and values.

Valuing environmental education as a cultural ecosystem service at Hudson River Park,"Hutcheson, W; Hoagland, P; Jin, D","The Hudson River and its estuary is once again an ecologically, economically, and culturally functional component of New York City's natural environment. The estuary's cultural significance may derive largely from environmental education, including marine science programs for the public. These programs are understood as ""cultural"" ecosystem services but are rarely evaluated in economic terms. We estimated the economic value of the Hudson River Park's environmental education programs. We compiled data on visits by schools and summer camps from 32 New York City school districts to the Park during the years 2014 and 2015. A ""travel cost"" approach was adapted from the field of environmental economics to estimate the value of education in this context. A small-but conservative-estimate of the Park's annual education program benefits ranged between $7500 and 25,500, implying an average capitalized value on the order of $0.6 million. Importantly, organizations in districts with high proportions of minority students or English language learners were found to be more likely to participate in the Park's programs. The results provide an optimistic view of the benefits of environmental education focused on urban estuaries, through which a growing understanding of ecological systems could lead to future environmental improvements.

Involvement of the dopaminergic system in the antidepressant-like effect of the lectin isolated from the red marine alga Solieria filiformis in mice,"Abreu, TM; Monteiro, VS; Martins, ABS; Teles, FB; Rivanor, RLD; Mota, EF; Macedo, DS; de Vasconcelos, SMM; Honorio, JER; Benevides, NMB","This study aimed at evaluating the antidepressant-like action of the marine alga Solieria filiformis lectin (SfL) and to investigate the participation of the monoaminergic system in this action. For this, male Swiss mice (n = 10) were pretreated with intravenous injections (i.v.) of SfL (1, 3 or 9 mg/kg) and submitted to open field (OFT), tail suspension (TST), forced swimming (FST), elevated plus-maze (EPMT) and hole-board tests (HBT). As controls, mice received sterile saline (i.v.), imipramine (10 or 30 mg/kg; intraperitoneally - i.p.) or diazepam (1 mk/kg; i.p.). To assess the involvement of the monoaminergic system in SfL effects, the FST was conducted in mice pretreated with PCPA, an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, or noradrenergic and dopaminergic receptors specific antagonists. The results showed that SI has an antidepressant-like effect, with no psychostimulant and anxiolytic-like effects. When denatured or combined with mannan, SfL lost the ability to reduce the immobility time in the FST. In addition, SfL antidepressant-like effect was inhibited by the pretreatment of mice with SCH 23390, a dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist, and by sulpiride, a dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist. Thus, SfL produced an antidepressant-like effect, which is probably dependent on its interaction with the dopaminergic system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Current knowledge and future research directions for the monitoring and management of visitors in recreational and protected areas,"Pickering, C; Rossi, SD; Hernando, A; Barros, A","Visitation to recreation and protected areas is increasing globally and in many regions, including Europe, so is research on visitation. But who, where, what and how is the research done and what are the trends and key research gaps? The systematic quantitative review of 758 oral abstracts from the first seven conferences on Monitoring and Management of Visitors in Recreation and Protected Areas answers research questions on methods, goals and locations presented in the last decade as well as discussing trends and recommendations for the future. These major multi-disciplinary conferences are held every two years in different countries in Europe. Most (72%) of the research was from Europe, predominantly from countries where English is not the dominant language. Nearly every abstract was from terrestrial natural areas, often terrestrial protected areas (56%), with only three marine studies. Most abstracts (85%) were in the social sciences, either assessing visitor profile data along with motivations, satisfaction and experiences or focused on psychological aspects such as the attitudes, perceptions and behavior of visitors. Environmental research (32% abstracts) was mostly on vegetation, wildlife and landscape features with limited research on aquatic systems. Technology is driving research, with the analysis of big data from social media transforming where and how visitors can be monitored. Important gaps remain including research from countries and regions with large protected area systems and high levels of visitation including in Asia, South America and Africa, as well as some countries in Europe such as France.Management implications: The article describes the previous trends in this conference series on outdoor recreation. The findings suggest that future conferences could:enhance the attendance and representation of researchers from parts of Europe so far under represented and different parts of the world such as Asia, the Russian Federation and Africa to make the conference truly international,strengthen the relevance of the conference for practitioners and managers, andcommunicate the value of research, including how new methods and technologies can enhance sustainable decision making.",2018,,JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,21,,18-Oct,WOS:000428135700002,10.1016/j.jort.2017.11.002,,#19859,Pickering 2018,,
Reduced gene expression of sirtuins and active AMPK levels in children and adolescents with obesity and insulin resistance,"Sadeghabadi, ZA; Nourbakhsh, M; Pasalar, P; Emamgholipour, S; Golestani, A; Larijani, B; Razzaghy-Azar, M","Background: Sirtuins, including SIRT1 and SIRT2, are longevity-associated deacetylase enzymes that modulate metabolic homeostasis in response to the cellular energy state. Adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) and SIRT1 are interrelated and share several common target pathways. This study aimed to evaluate the SIRT1 and SIRT2 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as plasma levels of AMPK, in obese children and adolescents.Materials and methods: Participants included 60 children and adolescents (30 obese and 30 age- and gender-matched control subjects). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to assess the SIRT1 and SIRT2 gene expression in PBMCs. Serum phospho-AMPK and insulin were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and insulin resistance (IR) was calculated by the Homeostasis Model of Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). Glucose and lipid profile were also measured.Results: SIRT1 gene expression and phospho-AMPK plasma levels were significantly diminished in obese subjects compared to the control group, and both SIRT1 and SIRT2 were significantly lower in obese children with IR compared to those without IR. SIRT1 expression revealed significant negative correlations with body mass index and waist circumference as well as insulin and HOMA-IR and a positive correlation with AMPK. SIRT2 negatively correlated with SIRT1 and positively correlated with high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C).Conclusion: SIRT1 and SIRT2 expression and AMPK levels decrease in children with obesity and IR. Targeting SIRT1 can be valuable in preventing obesity-associated IR in childhood and adolescence. (c) 2017 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Advection of Karenia brevis blooms from the Florida Panhandle towards Mississippi coastal waters,"Soto, IM; Cambazoglu, MK; Boyette, AD; Broussard, K; Sheehan, D; Howden, SD; Shiller, AM; Dzwonkowski, B; Hode, L; Fitzpatrick, PJ; Arnone, RA; Mickle, PF; Cressman, K","Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) of Karenia brevis have been documented along coastal waters of every state bordering the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Some Gulf Coast locations, such as Florida and Texas, suffer from recurrent intense and spatially large blooms, while others such as Mississippi seem to rarely observe them. The main objective of this work is to understand the dynamics that led to the K. brevis bloom in Mississippi coastal waters in fall 2015. Blooms of K. brevis from the Florida Panhandle region are often advected westward towards the Mississippi-Alabama coast; however there is interannual variability in their presence and intensity in Mississippi coastal waters. The 2015 K. brevis bloom was compared to the 2007 Florida Panhandle K. brevis bloom, which showed a westward advection pattern, but did not intensify along the Mississippi coast. Cell counts and flow cytometry were obtained from the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources, Alabama Department of Public Health, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and The University of Southern Mississippi. Ocean color satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Aqua satellite was used to detect and delineate the blooms in 2007 and 2015. Two different regional applications of NCOM-Navy Coastal Ocean Model (1-km resolution NCOM-GoM/Gulf of Mexico and 6-km resolution NCOM-IASNFS/Intra Americas Sea Nowcast Forecast System) were used to understand the circulation and transport pathways. A Lagrangian particle tracking software was used to track the passive movement of particles released at different locations for both bloom events. Ancillary data (e.g., nutrients, wind, salinity, river discharge) from local buoys, monitoring stations and coincident oceanographic cruises were also included in the analysis. The blooms of K. brevis reached the Mississippi coast both years; however, the bloom in 2007 lasted only a few days and there is no evidence that it entered the Mississippi Sound. Two major differences were observed between both years. First, circulation patterns in 2015 resulting from an intense westward-northwestward that persisted until December allowed for continuous advection, whereas this pattern was not evident in 2007. Second, local river discharge was elevated throughout late fall 2015 while 2007 was below the average. Thus, elevated discharge may have provided sufficient nutrients for bloom intensification. These results illustrate the complex, but important interactions in coastal zones. Further, they emphasize the importance in establishing comprehensive HAB monitoring programs, which facilitate our understanding of nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics, and stress the importance for multi-agency cooperation across state boundaries.

Circulation pattern-based assessment of projected climate change for a catchment in Spain,"Gupta, HV; Sapriza-Azuri, G; Jodar, J; Carrera, J","We present an approach for evaluating catchment-scale hydro-meteorological impacts of projected climate change based on the atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs) of a region. Our approach is motivated by the conjecture that GCMs are especially good at simulating the atmospheric circulation patterns that control moisture transport, and which can be expected to change in response to global warming. In support of this, we show (for the late 20th century) that GCMs provide much better simulations of ACPs than those of precipitation amount for the Upper Guadiana Basin in central Spain. For the same period, four of the twenty GCMs participating in the most recent (5th) IPCC Assessment provide quite accurate representations of the spatial patterns of mean sea level pressure, the frequency distribution of ACP type, the 'number of rainy days per month', and the daily 'probability of rain' (they also reproduce the trend of 'wet day amount', though not the actual magnitudes). A consequent analysis of projected trends and changes in hydro-climatic ACPology between the late 20th and 21st Centuries indicates that (1) actual changes appear to be occurring faster than predicted by the models, and (2) for two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) the expected decline in precipitation volume is associated mainly with a few specific ACPs (primarily directional flows from the Atlantic Ocean and Cantabric Sea), and with decreasing probability of rain (linked to increasing temperatures) rather than wet day amount. Our approach is a potentially more insightful alternative for catchment-scale climate impacts assessments than the common approach of statistical downscaling and bias correction.

Challenges and future trends in marine robotics,"Zereik, E; Bibuli, M; Miskovic, N; Ridao, P; Pascoal, A","Spawned by fast paced progress in marine science and technology, the past two decades have witnessed growing interest in ocean exploration and exploitation for scientific and commercial purposes, the development of technological products for the maritime and offshore industries, and a host of other activities in which the marine environment takes center stage. In this context, marine robotics has steadily emerged as a key enabling technology for the execution of increasingly complex and challenging missions at sea. Intensive research and development in this field have led to major advances and shown unequivocally the effectiveness and reliability of marine robotics solutions in several domains. This progress goes hand in hand with the availability of increasingly sophisticated acoustic networks for multiple, cooperative missions involving surface and underwater robots. At the root of this trend is the fruitful dialogue between robotic systems developers and end-users with the capacity to convert general mission objectives into functional and technical specifications that serve as application-driven requirements for engineering development. The result is the tremendous progress observed in the consolidated methodologies and procedures adopted and the consequent impact on science, industry, and the society at large. In spite of the progress in the area, however many challenges must still be faced and novel applications will continue to set further requirements for future generations of marine robots and their enabling systems. The time is therefore appropriate to overview recent trends in the field of marine robotics and assess their impact on several important application domains. With these objectives in mind, in the present paper we highlight key technological achievements in the field, analyze some of the shortcomings encountered, and indicate specific issues that warrant further research and development effort. To this end, we review a number of highly representative projects in the field, with due account for the theoretical frameworks upon which technological developments build upon. Finally, the paper concludes with an outlook on the future of marine robotics, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint, and describes recently initiated projects that hold promise for the development of advanced tools and systems for ocean exploration and exploitation.

Benchmarking sensor fusion capabilities of an integrated instrumentation package,"Cotter, E; Murphy, P; Polagye, B","Quantifying and mitigating environmental risks presented by marine energy conversion systems requires a variety of sensors (active acoustic, passive acoustic, and optical). The operation of these sensors must satisfy three directives to be effective: (1) do not alter the environment through operation of sensors; (2) capture rare events; and (3) do not accrue unmanageable volumes of low-value data. This requires integrating sensors into a single package, rather than operating them independently. The Adaptable Monitoring Package is an integrated instrumentation package that combines a multibeam sonar, acoustic camera, current profiler, optical cameras, and an array of hydrophones. The capabilities and limitations of the AMP sensors were benchmarked using cooperative targets, and real-time target tracking and detection was used to detect opportunistic targets (e.g., diving birds, seals). During an initial deployment, automatic detection of opportunistic targets achieved a 58% true positive rate and a 99% true negative rate (100% corresponding to an ideal system in both cases). In post-processing, target tracking data were used to evaluate automatic target classification capabilities using a k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Results suggest that real-time target classification should be possible and enable integrated instrumentation systems to meet the monitoring needs of marine energy deployments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Geographical characterization of the Zanzibar coastal zone and its management perspectives,"Khamis, ZA; Kalliola, R; Kayhko, N","The coastal zone of Zanzibar, Tanzania, is culturally, socially, economically, and ecologically unique but there is a lack of baseline information about its state characteristics as a whole. This paper provides a holistic assessment of the environmental and socio-economic settings of the Zanzibar coastal zone with its unusual physiographic characteristics and key habitats such as coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass meadows. The human livelihood of Zanzibar is unmistakably coastal with its many cultural adaptations but the most recent decades have shown drastic changes in the prevailing seaborne and coastal activities. This development has not been without disputes among the different interest groups. The driver pressure -state-impact-response approach allows to scrutinize the socio-ecological system circles of the Zanzibar coastal zone. Systematically, the approach provides interlink of the drivers and with their impacts on the socio-economic systems and the appropriate responses necessary to combat the impacts. The main drivers identified to be the population increase, urbanization with settlement expansion, and the rapid expansion of the shore-dwelling tourism with its associated infrastructures. These factors are adversely impacting the coastal and marine nature and the traditional socio-economic systems. The Zanzibar government has put forward several initiatives to protect the health of the coastal ecosystems and the endurance of the traditional cultures. The effective implementation of measures, for example, the Zanzibar Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning as part of the National Land Use Plan, have not yet been sufficient to restore the situation. However, there are also signs of commitment being fostered and an improvement in the know-how for making changes. We conclude by asserting the need for coastal and marine spatial planning as the holistic and robust approach for sustainable coastal and marine planning while emphasizing community participation throughout the process.

Comparison of an electronic versus traditional food diary for assessing dietary intake-A validation study,"Fuller, NR; Fong, M; Gerofi, J; Ferkh, F; Leung, C; Leung, LS; Zhang, SY; Skilton, M; Caterson, ID","Background: Paper-based estimated food diaries are often used in research to collect dietary data, despite this method being burdensome for both participants and researchers. Such food diaries are often time consuming, labour intensive, and rely on participant literacy and therefore may lead to greater rates of under-reporting.Methods: This study assessed the validity of the 'Boden Food Plate', a novel web-based electronic application, compared to a paper-based three-day estimated food diary. Participants were also asked to rate their satisfaction with the new electronic diary. Sixty-seven participants with overweight or obesity completed both the electronic and paper-based diaries at two different time-points.Results: Baseline BMI of participants (mean +/- standard deviation (SD)) was 30.4 +/- 2.9 kg/m(2), body weight was 87.6 +/- 13.4 kg, and age was 42.3 +/- 7.7 years. Fifty four percent (n = 41) of the cohort were female. Bland Altman plots for total energy, and percentage of total energy intake from fat, carbohydrate, and protein, indicated wide limits of agreement between the two methods of dietary data collection, and in some analyses there were a few cases that did not lie within the 95% confidence intervals. Approximately 70% of participants rated the electronic food diary as easier to use and more fun when compared to the traditional paper-based estimated food diary.Conclusion: Innovative and visual dietary collection applications such as the 'Boden Food Plate' provide an enjoyable and interactive means of measuring nutritional intake in a time efficient manner. Further validation studies incorporating micronutrient analysis and to improve the applications validity are warranted. (C) 2017 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

"The association between ethnicity, socioeconomic status and compliance to pediatric weight-management interventions - A systematic review","Ligthart, KAM; Buitendijk, L; Koes, BW; van Middelkoop, M","Background: High dropout rates and low compliance to pediatric weight management programs have been reported. Socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnicity have been suggested as potentially important determinants of dropout and non-compliance. This review aims to assess the association between SES, ethnicity and study- and intervention dropout and non-compliance among participants in pediatric weight-management programs.Methods: PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane, Web-of-Science and Google Scholar were searched for eligible studies up to March 2014. Included were randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled clinical trials and cohort studies evaluating pediatric weight-management programs. Studies had to report dropout or non-compliance to the study or intervention with regard to ethnicity or SES. Associations between SES and ethnicity and dropout and non-compliance were analysed descriptively.Results: Fourteen RCTs and 16 cohort studies were included, studying 7264 children and adolescents, aged 2-20 years. Twenty-four studies presented data on dropout or non-compliance regarding ethnicity and 26 studies presented data regarding SES. Black participants showed higher dropout rates in weight-management interventions (range 65-67%) than White participants (range 22-27%), and low family income was associated with lower compliance to weight-management interventions.Conclusions: Black ethnicity and low family income seemed to be associated with higher dropout and lower compliance to pediatric weight-management interventions. Future qualitative studies may be needed to assess underlying reasons for increased dropout and non-compliance in the sesub-populations. (C) 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

"Indicator-Driven Conservation Planning Across Terrestrial, Freshwater Aquatic, and Marine Ecosystems of the South Atlantic, USA","Pickens, BA; Mordecai, RS; Drew, CA; Alexander-Vaughn, LB; Keister, AS; Morris, HLC; Collazo, JA","Systematic conservation planning, a widely used approach to identify priority lands and waters, uses efficient, defensible, and transparent methods aimed at conserving biodiversity and ecological systems. Limited financial resources and competing land uses can be major impediments to conservation; therefore, participation of diverse stakeholders in the planning process is advantageous to help address broad-scale threats and challenges of the 21st century. Although a broad extent is needed to identify core areas and corridors for fish and wildlife populations, a finescale resolution is needed to manage for multiple, interconnected ecosystems. Here, we developed a conservation plan using a systematic approach to promote landscape-level conservation within the extent of the South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative. Our objective was to identify the highest-ranked 30% of lands and waters within the South Atlantic deemed necessary to conserve ecological and cultural integrity for the 10 primary ecosystems of the southeastern United States. These environments varied from terrestrial, freshwater aquatic, and marine. The planning process was driven by indicators of ecosystem integrity at a 4-ha resolution. We used the program Zonation and 28 indicators to optimize the identification of lands and waters to meet the stated objective. A novel part of our study was the prioritization of multiple ecosystems, and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach. The evaluation of indicator representation within prioritizations was a useful method to show where improvements could be made; some indicators dictated hotspots, some had a limited extent and were well represented, and others had a limited effect. Overall, we demonstrate that a broad-scale (408,276 km(2) of terrestrial and 411,239 km(2) of marine environments) conservation plan can be realized at a fine-scale resolution, which will allow implementation of the regional plan at a local level relevant to decision making.",2017,,JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,8,1,219-233,WOS:000403145300018,10.3996/062016-JFWM-044,,#19869,Pickens 2017,,
Long-term sulphate and inorganic nitrogen mass balance budgets in European ICP Integrated Monitoring catchments (1990-2012),"Vuorenmaa, J; Augustaitis, A; Beudert, B; Clarke, N; de Wit, HA; Dirnbock, T; Frey, J; Forsius, M; Indriksone, I; Kleemola, S; Kobler, J; Kram, P; Lindroos, AJ; Lundin, L; Ruoho-Airola, T; Ukonmaanaho, L; Vana, M","Empirical evidence based on integrated environmental monitoring including physical, chemical and biological variables is essential for evaluating the ecosystem benefits of costly emission reduction policies. The international multidisciplinary ICP IM (International Cooperative Programme on Integrated Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Ecosystems) programme studies the integrated effects of air pollution and climate change on ecosystems in unmanaged and calibrated forested catchments. We calculated site-specific annual input-output budgets for sulphate (SO4) and total inorganic nitrogen (TIN=NO3N + NH4-N) for 17 European ICP IM sites in 1990-2012. Temporal trends for input (deposition) and output (runoff water) fluxes and the net retention/net release of SO4 and TIN were also analysed. Large differences in the input and output fluxes of SO4 and TIN reflect important gradients of air pollution effects in Europe, with the highest deposition and runoff water fluxes at IM sites located in southern Scandinavia and in parts of Central and Eastern Europe and the lowest fluxes at more remote sites in northern European regions. A significant decrease in the total (wet + dry) deposition of non-marine SO4 and bulk deposition of TIN was found at 90% and 65% of the sites, respectively. Output fluxes of non-marine SO4 in runoff decreased significantly at 65% of the sites, indicating positive effects of the international emission abatement actions in Europe during the last 20 years. Catchments retained SO4 in the early and mid 1990s, but this shifted towards a net release in the late 1990s, which may be due to the mobilization of legacy S pools accumulated during times of high atmospheric SO4 deposition. Despite decreased deposition, TIN output fluxes and retention rates showed a mixed response with both decreasing (9 sites) and increasing (8 sites) trend slopes, and trends were rarely significant. In general, TIN was strongly retained in the catchments not affected by natural disturbances. The long-term annual variation in net releases for SO4 was explained by variations in runoff and SO4 concentrations in deposition, while a variation in TIN concentrations in runoff was mostly associated with a variation of the TIN retention rate in catchments. The net release of SO4 from forest soils may delay the recovery from acidification for surface waters and the continued enrichment of nitrogen in catchment soils poses a threat to terrestrial biodiversity and may ultimately lead to a higher TIN runoff through N-saturation. Continued monitoring and further evaluations of mass balance budgets are thus needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Fostering fisheries management efficiency through collaboration networks: the case of the Kanan Kay Alliance in the Mexican Caribbean,"Moreno, A; Bourillon, L; Flores, E; Fulton, S","After decades of implementation of territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFs) and other fisheries management measures around the world, it is clear that monitoring their progress and results in biological and socioeconomic terms is necessary, and that involving fishers in the design and implementation will improve their likelihood of success. However, what receives less attention is the importance of multistakeholder collaboration, communication, and shared vision that increase management implementation capacity and effectiveness, while achieving an efficient use of the limited resources available to fisheries managers. Five years ago, an initiative called ""Kanan Kay Alliance"" emerged in Mexico: a voluntary, multistakeholder collaborative network formed by 40+ organizations (fishing cooperatives, government, non-governmental organizations, researchers, and philanthropic foundations). The alliance established a shared vision and collaborative work plan focused on the establishment of fish refuges (no-take zones) within TURFs across the Mexican Caribbean. The Kanan Kay Alliance offers a unique opportunity for dialogue, promotes value-added collaborative actions, and reinforces key initiatives.

Measuring what we value: The utility of mixed methods approaches for incorporating values into marine social-ecological system management,"Murray, G; D'Anna, L; MacDonald, P","Recent shifts towards ecosystem-based management and other holistic and participatory forms of oceans governance and management have come with demands for ways to better incorporate social data into decision-making processes such as integrated ecosystem assessments. This includes information related to a wide range of values associated with different aspects of marine social-ecological systems. This paper addresses that demand by first discussing various notions of value in the literature, and then presenting two case studies from British Columbia, Canada that illuminate some of the opportunities and complexities of using a mix of quantitative and qualitative approaches to bear on the challenge. Findings suggest that values are diverse and are contextually dependent, varying at small scales. Findings further suggest that values are hierarchically arranged and grouped differently by individuals into what might be called perspectives. Finally, the findings highlight that mixed-methods approaches featuring qualitative and quantitative elements may, provide a step towards resolving tensions between, on one the one hand, a need to distil complex systems into observable, measurable indicators where the inevitable tradeoffs involved in resource management can be articulated, weighed, and on the other hand, a sense that characterizing the broad range of values that are relevant in shaping attitudes and conceptions of ""what should be"" in marine systems requires holistic thinking and attention to scale, context, relationality, subjectivity and rich detail.

The lessons learned from MSP over the last decade revealed the importance of applying multidisciplinary approaches to expand and deepen the involvement of stakeholders from economic and political decision-making spheres, as well as considering social and cultural dimensions.As part of the MSP process in the western tropical Pacific region, a participatory and prospective method was undertaken (the territory game). The method is based on the collective construction of spatial. representations by a pool of relevant stakeholders. Both, the spatial outputs, as well as the discussions leading to them, were analysed to evaluate the stakeholders' current and future visions of the territory.During the methodological pathway, visions developed ranging from a local scale to areas that covered all oceanic compartments, as well as some even considering the entire region. Local and intangible knowledge and opinions were taken into consideration, and helped to create a comprehensive understanding of the context. In the course of the project, participants proposed socio-ecological management solutions with innovative spatial scales. Furthering this effort, the proposals were shaped to the action capacity of the states concerned; in addition, certain Pacific countries were identified as potential leaders for steering some of the proposed actions.This approach can help to promote local actors' involvement in MSP by a collective analysis as well as to strengthen integration of cultural and social aspects. The whole process is based on biophysical and geopolitical scientific information to improve the credibility of the results. The suggested actions could thus be implemented by each state and the Western Pacific region. Though the integration of the results into high-level decision making was not tested yet, the presented approach would allow an increased acceptance of suggested directions and actions by taking into account the different spatial visions of the relevant actors.

Shifting paradigms in coastal restoration: Six decades' lessons from China,"Liu, ZZ; Cui, BS; He, Q","With accelerating degradation of coastal environment worldwide, restoration has been elevated as a global strategy to enhance the functioning and social services of coastal ecosystems. While many developing countries suffer from intense coastal degradation, current understanding of the science and practice of their coastal restorations is extremely limited. Based on analysis of >1000 restoration projects, we provide the first synthesis of China's coastal restorations. We show that China's coastal restoration has recently entered a rapidly developing stage, with an increasing number of restoration projects carried out in multiple types of coastal ecosystems. While long-term, national-level restorations enforced by the government appear promising for some coastal ecosystems, especially mangroves, restorations of many other coastal ecosystems, such as salt marshes, seagrasses and coral reefs, have been much less implemented, likely due to under-appreciation of their ecosystem services values. Furthermore, the planning, techniques, research/assessment, and participation models underlying current restorations remain largely inadequate for restoration to effectively halt rapid coastal degradation. To promote success, we propose a framework where paradigms in current restorations from planning to implementation and assessment are transformed in multiple ways. Our study has broad implications for coastal environmental management policies and practices, and should inform sustainable development of coupled human-ocean systems in many countries.

Bacteria as part of bioluminescence emission at the deep ANTARES station (North-Western Mediterranean Sea) during a one-year survey,"Martini, S; Michotey, V; Casalot, L; Bonin, P; Guasco, S; Garel, M; Tamburini, C","Bioluminescent bacteria have been studied during a one-year survey in 2011 at the deep ANTARES site (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea, 2000 m depth). The neutrino underwater telescope ANTARES, located at this station, has been used to record the bioluminescence at the same depth. Together with these data, environmental variables (potential temperature, salinity, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon and oxygen) have been characterized in water samples. The year 2011 was characterized by relatively stable conditions, as revealed by minor variability in the monitored oceanographic variables, by low bioluminescence and low current speed. This suggests weak eukaryote participation and mainly non-stimulated light emission. Hence, no processes of dense water have affected the ANTARES station during this survey. Abundance of bioluminescent bacteria belonging to Photobacterium genus, measured by qPCR of the luxF gene, ranged from 1.4 x 10(2) to 7.2 x 10(2) genes mL(-1). Their effective activity was confirmed through mRNA luxF quantification. Our results reveal that bioluminescent bacteria appeared more active than the total counterpart of bacteria, suggesting an ecological benefit of this feature such as favoring interaction with macro-organisms. Moreover, these results show that part of the bioluminescence, recorded at 2000 m depth over one year, could be due to bioluminescent bacteria in stable hydrological conditions.

Integrated terrestrial and marine planning in England's coastal inter-tidal zone: Assessing the operational effectiveness of the Coastal Concordat,"Turner, J; Essex, S","In many countries, the regulation of activities and development in the marine environment has begun to evolve from a compartmentalised, fragmented, sectoral and uncoordinated system into a more strategic, comprehensive, integrated and transparent one. A remaining challenge, however, is the effective integration Of marine and terrestrial planning, because the tools and mechanisms necessary for its achievement have been slow to be implemented. The introduction of the England's Coastal Concordat in 2013, as a voluntary framework for better integrating marine and terrestrial planning consents, represents an atypical mechanism to secure these goals. This paper is a preliminary survey of the perceived effectiveness. of the Coastal Concordat, based on a survey of 32 professionals from the terrestrial planning"" authorities, marine statutory agencies and marine-sector businesses. While this evaluation is made less than two years after the introduction of the Coastal Concordat, it is important to undertake a preliminary examination, from various stakeholder perspectives, of the factors likely to be influential in the integration of regulatory systems, before the approach is 'rolled out' across other parts of England's intertidal coastal zone. The results indicate that the Coastal Concordat has produced benefits for marine planning in coastal areas, but that these improvements are largely experienced within the public sector in terms of better communication, early engagement, and a single point of contact. The marine sector businesses are more neutral about the benefits of the Concordat. It is clear, however, that Marine sector businesses must participate in the formulation of any reforms if an effective integrated system of planning and managenient of coastal"" environments is to be achieved.

This includes improved collaborations within the scientific community but also enhanced dialogue between scientists and societal stakeholders, especially with Arctic communities. As a contribution to the Third International Conference on Arctic Research Planning (ICARPIII), the Arctic in Rapid Transition (ART) network held an international workshop in France, in October 2014, in order to discuss high-priority requirements for future Arctic marine and coastal research from an early-career scientists (ECS) perspective. The discussion encompassed a variety of research fields, including topics of oceanographic conditions, sea-ice monitoring, marine biodiversity, land-ocean interactions, and geological reconstructions, as well as law and governance issues. Participants of the workshop strongly agreed on the need to enhance interdisciplinarity in order to collect comprehensive knowledge about the modern and past Arctic Ocean's geo-ecological dynamics. Such knowledge enables improved predictions of Arctic developments and provides the basis for elaborate decision-making on future actions under plausible environmental and climate scenarios in the high northern latitudes.

"Evaluation of the performance of the first marine reserve in Chile, La Rinconada, in the field of conservation on its focal species, the scallop Argopecten purpuratus","Avendano, M; Cantillanez, M","We evaluated the performance of the first marine reserve in Chile, created in La Rinconada, Antofagasta, based on biotic indicators (abundance; population structure and recruitment success) of its focal species the scallop Argopecten purpuratus. This was attained by analyzing species population information, acquired during 2001, 2002, 2005 and 2009, by direct assessment diving, and on spat settlement into artificial collectors. The results show variation in the density of the specimens, which strongly affects the total abundance of the population, with a significant decrease in their average size in time, which is a decrease of individuals on the minimum legal size (90 mm) from 2.6 x 10(6) individuals in 2001 to 1.5 x 10(5) individual in 2009. This reduction has generated a drastic decline in their spawning stock, which has seriously impacted on the uptake of seed, descending from 15,340 ind. collector(-1) in 2001 to 1,157 ind. collector-1 in 2009. The analysis of these results through 3 indicators, indicates that the measures of conservation have failed to recover its density and size structure, to enhance the availability of seeds and breeding adults, which were the main purposes for the creation of this marine reserve. While the main reason that inspired its creation was the conservation of the resource A. purpuratus, this measure has resulted in increased interest for illegal exploitation. The need for implementing measures that allow effective participation is concluded, with equity regarding resource utilization, considering that after 20 years of fishing ban, regulatory measures imposed by the State, have not had the expected results.",2016,,REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA MARINA Y OCEANOGRAFIA,51,2,407-420,WOS:000382151100017,10.4067/S0718-19572016000200017,,#19883,Avendano 2016,,
North and equatorial Pacific Ocean circulation in the CORE-II hindcast simulations,"Tseng, YH; Lin, HY; Chen, HC; Thompson, K; Bentsen, M; Boning, CW; Bozec, A; Cassou, C; Chassignet, E; Chow, CH; Danabasoglu, G; Danilov, S; Farneti, R; Fogli, PG; Fujii, Y; Griffies, SM; Ilicak, M; Jung, T; Masina, S; Navarra, A; Patara, L; Samuels, BL; Scheinert, M; Sidorenko, D; Sui, CH; Tsujino, H; Valcke, S; Voldoire, A; Wang, Q; Yeager, SG","We evaluate the mean circulation patterns, water mass distributions, and tropical dynamics of the North and Equatorial Pacific Ocean based on a suite of global ocean-sea ice simulations driven by the CORE-II atmospheric forcing from 1963-2007. The first three moments (mean, standard deviation and skewness) of sea surface height and surface temperature variability are assessed against observations. Large discrepancies are found in the variance and skewness of sea surface height and in the skewness of sea surface temperature. Comparing with the observation, most models underestimate the Kuroshio transport in the Asian Marginal seas due to the missing influence of the unresolved western boundary current and mesoscale eddies. In terms of the Mixed Layer Depths (MLDs) in the North Pacific, the two observed maxima associated with Subtropical Mode Water and Central Mode Water formation coalesce into a large pool of deep MLDs in all participating models, but another local maximum associated with the formation of Eastern Subtropical Mode Water can be found in all models with different magnitudes. The main model bias of deep MLDs results from excessive Subtropical Mode Water formation due to inaccurate representation of the Kuroshio separation and of the associated excessively warm and salty Kuroshio water. Further water mass analysis shows that the North Pacific Intermediate Water can penetrate southward in most models, but its distribution greatly varies among models depending not only on grid resolution and vertical coordinate but also on the model dynamics. All simulations show overall similar large scale tropical current system, but with differences in the structures of the Equatorial Undercurrent. We also confirm the key role of the meridional gradient of the wind stress curl in driving the equatorial transport, leading to a generally weak North Equatorial Counter Current in all models due to inaccurate CORE-II equatorial wind fields. Most models show a larger interior transport of Pacific subtropical cells than the observation due to the overestimated transport in the Northern Hemisphere likely resulting from the deep pycnocline.

Best options for the exposure of traditional and innovative moss bags: A systematic evaluation in three European countries,"Capozzi, F; Giordano, S; Aboal, JR; Adamo, P; Bargagli, R; Boquete, T; Di Palma, A; Real, C; Reski, R; Spagnuolo, V; Steinbauer, K; Tretiach, M; Varela, Z; Zechmeister, H; Fernandez, JA","To develop an internationally standardized protocol for the moss bag technique application, the research team participating in the FP7 European project ""MOSSclone"" focused on the optimization of the moss bags exposure in terms of bag characteristics (shape of the bags, mesh size, weight/surface ratio), duration and height of exposure by comparing traditional moss bags to a new concept bag, ""Mossphere"". In particular, the effects of each variable on the metal uptake from the air were evaluated by a systematic experimental design carried out in urban, industrial, agricultural and background areas of three European countries with oceanic, Mediterranean and continental climate. The results evidenced that the shape, the mesh size of the bags and the exposure height (in the tested ranges), did not significantly influence the uptake capacity of the transplanted moss. The aspects more affecting the element uptake were represented by the density of the moss inside the bags and the relative ratio between its weight and the surface area of the bag. We found that, the lower the density, the higher the uptake recorded. Moreover, three weeks of exposure were not enough to have a consistent uptake signal in all the environments tested, thus we suggest an exposure period not shorter than 6 weeks, which is appropriate in most situations. The above results were confirmed in all the countries and scenarios tested. The adoption of a shared exposure protocol by the research community is strongly recommended since it is a key aspect to make biomonitoring surveys directly comparable, also in view of its recognition as a monitoring method by the EU legislation.

"Demographic factors, weight management behaviours, receipt of healthcare professional's counselling and having knowledge in basic anthropometric measurements associated with underassessment of weight status in overweight and obese type 2 diabetes patients","Mogre, V; Nsoh, JA; Wanaba, P; Apala, P","Objectives: To describe the prevalence of underassessment of weight status and weight management behaviours and to evaluate how underassessment of weight status is associated with demographic factors, receipt of healthcare professional's weight management counselling, weight management behaviours and having knowledge in basic anthropometric measurements.Methods: This cross-sectional study included 222 overweight and obese type 2 diabetes patients. Participants' weight and height were determined using appropriate tools. Demographic characteristics, knowledge in basic anthropometric measurements and self-assessment of weight status were determined using a questionnaire.Results: They were more overweight (65.8%) than obese (34.2%) participants. Sixty percent reported receipt of weight management counselling from health care professionals. The majority (50.5%) of the participants did not know which category of weight status they were, 30.6% assessed themselves as normal weight and 18.0% assessed themselves as overweight/obese. Prevalence of underassessment was 63.6%. Participants underassessing (2.9% vs. 20%; p = 0.004) their weight status were less likely to be able to measure their weight and calculate BMI than their counterparts who accurately self-assessed their weight status. Overweight participants were 3 times more likely to underassess their weight status than obese participants. Underassessment of weight status was less likely in females and in participants who reported receipt of weight management counselling than in those who did not receive weight management counselling.Conclusion: Underassessment of weight status was more common in overweight than in obese participants. Receipt of weight management counselling was associated with having accurate assessment of weight status. Lack of knowledge in anthropometric measurements was widespread.

Information preferences for the evaluation of coastal development impacts on ecosystem services: A multi-criteria assessment in the Australian context,"Marre, JB; Pascoe, S; Thebaud, O; Jennings, S; Boncoeur, J; Coglan, L","Ecosystem based management requires the integration of various types of assessment indicators. Understanding stakeholders' information preferences is important, in selecting those indicators that best support management and policy. Both the preferences of decision-makers and the general public may matter, in democratic participatory management institutions. This paper presents a multi-criteria analysis aimed at quantifying the relative importance to these groups of economic, ecological and socio-economic indicators usually considered when managing ecosystem services in a coastal development context. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied within two nationwide surveys in Australia, and preferences of both the general public and decision-makers for these indicators are elicited and compared. Results show that, on average across both groups, the priority in assessing a generic coastal development project is for the ecological assessment of its impacts on marine biodiversity. Ecological assessment indicators are globally preferred to both economic and socio-economic indicators regardless of the nature of the impacts studied. These results are observed for a significantly larger proportion of decision-maker than general public respondents, questioning the extent to which the general public's preferences are well reflected in decision-making processes.

An indicator framework for assessing progress in land and marine planning in Colombia and Cuba,"Botero, CM; Fanning, LM; Milanes, C; Planas, JA","Achievement of environmental management goals and objectives in coastal areas, including how to measure success, remains a significant subject for discussion among scholars and practitioners, meanwhile four distinct management efforts potentially converge within the coastal zone: land-use planning (LUP), river basin management (RBM), marine spatial planning (MSP) and integrated coastal management (ICM). This paper examines the general lack of attention being paid to overlapping spatial boundaries within the landward and marine areas and proposes an indicator-based framework to measure the effectiveness of the individual planning instruments, as opposed to specific initiatives, in achieving management goals. The six indicators used in the framework (planning; participation; communication; integration; responsibility and balance) are based on a modified version of the Coastal Sustainability Standard methodology described by Gallagher (2010). The framework provides for four scenarios of progress in three geographical dimensions (river, municipality and marine area) to be assessed. For this study, the Caribbean coast of Colombia and Cuba were identified as the areas to test the feasibility and relevance of the indicator framework to monitor progress in the different management approaches established to achieve coastal sustainability. Several key observations and-lessons from the indicator-based framework are discussed in order to analyze the overlapping of the four space-based instruments, identify areas for targeted intervention and improve their integration.

Managing marine wildlife tourism activities: Analysis of motivations and specialization levels of divers and whale watchers,"Bentz, J; Lopes, F; Calado, H; Dearden, P","This paper reports findings derived from two samples, each of which numbered over 400 respondents. The first was of divers and the second of whale watchers, and both samples were from the Azores, a major diving and whale watching tourist location in the northeast Atlantic ocean. Distinctions were made between generalists and specialists in the recreational activities with the objective of assessing differences in perceptions and behaviors. While there are commonalities in concerns over environmental issues distinct differences were found. The findings also question previous studies that suggest higher degrees of involvement are related to greater frequencies of a given activity. With reference to the passive activity of whale watching no such relationship was found, but the behaviors of divers are consistent with such hypotheses, and it is suggested that the requirement for training is one determining factor that reinforces involvement as people become more specialized and skilled.

"Fatty acids' profiles as indicators of stress induced by of a common herbicide on two marine bivalves species: Cerastoderma edule (Linnaeus, 1758) and Scrobicularia plana (da Costa, 1778)","Goncalves, AMM; Mesquita, AF; Verdelhos, T; Coutinho, JAP; Marques, JC; Goncalves, F","In Europe, mainly the Mediterranean region, intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides has been recorded over the past 30 years, exceeding, in some cases, the limits of contamination authorized by the European Union. The intensive use of pollutants in fields near ecological coastal wetlands has led to implementation of pesticide monitoring programs to recover aquatic systems such as the Mondego estuary (Figueira da Foz, Portugal). According to information from the agricultural cooperatives of the Mondego valley, Primextra(R) Gold TZ is the most-used herbicide in corn crop fields. Biomarkers, such fatty acids (FAs), proved to be new and potentially powerful tools to detect, illustrate, and evaluate exposure to and the effects of contamination hazards. They play important roles in establishing neural levels in organisms' biochemical and physiological responses and are considered good bio-indicators of stress and potential indicators of ecosystem health. Bivalves are currently used in ecotoxicological bioassays because of their ecological importance, wide geographic distribution, ease of handling in the laboratory and in the field, and their ability to filter and ingest large volumes of water and sediment particles. Thus, the main goal of this work was to determine the toxic and biochemical (namely fatty acid profiles) responses of two size classes (small and big) of the two marine bivalve species Cerastoderma edule and Scrobicularia plane to the herbicide Primextra Gold. Furthermore, we aimed to compare the fatty acid contents, and thus the nutritive values, of both species and size classes collected in the field with those under laboratory conditions. Results show S. plana is more sensitive to the herbicide than C edule. In general, among the larger-sized specimens in the field, S. plum is more nutritive than C. edule, but among the smaller-sized specimens, the opposite tendency is seen, where C. edule presents a greater abundance of FAs.

"Mercury levels assessment and its relationship with oxidative stress biomarkers in children from three localities in Yucatan, Mexico","Rangel-Mendez, JA; Arcega-Cabrera, FE; Fargher, LF; Moo-Puc, RE","Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant that is released into the environment from geologic and anthropogenic sources. Once it enters an organism, it generates several toxicity mechanisms and oxidative stress has been proposed as the main one. Metal susceptibility is greater in children, which is a result of their physiology and behavior. In Yucatan, Mexico, burning of unregulated garbage dumps and household trash, ingestion of top marine predators, and pottery manufacturing are among the conditions that could promote Hg exposure. However, for Yucatan, there are no published studies that report Hg levels and associated oxidative stress status in children. Therefore, this study aimed to assess Hg levels in blood and urine and oxidative stress biomarkers levels in a sample of 107 healthy children from three localities in Yucatan, Mexico, as well as investigate the relationship between these parameters. Hg was detected in 11(10.28%) of blood samples and 38 (35.51%) of urine samples collected from the participating children. Fourteen subjects showed Hg above recommended levels. The oxidative stress biomarkers were slightly elevated in comparison with other studies and were statistically different between the sampling sites. No linear correlation between Hg levels and oxidative stress,biomarkers was found. Nevertheless, exploratory univariate and multivariate analysis showed non-linear relations among the measured variables. Globally, the study provides, for the first time, information regarding Hg levels and their relationship with oxidative stress biomarkers in a juvenile population from Mexico's southeast (Yucatan) region. In agreement with worldwide concern about Hg, this study should stimulate studies on metal monitoring in humans (especially children) among scientists working in Mexico, the establishment of polices for its regulation, and the reduction of human health risks.

"Underwater noise assessment in the Gulf of Trieste (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) using an MSFD approach","Codarin, A; Picciulin, M","In the marine environment underwater noise is one of the most widespread input of man-made energy. Recently, the European Commission has stressed the necessity of establishing threshold levels as a target for the descriptor 112.1 ""Continuous low frequency sounds"" in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). In 2012, a monthly underwater noise monitoring programme was conducted in the Gulf of Trieste (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy); the collected acoustic samples (frequency range: 10-20,000 Hz) were analysed in the 1/3 octave bands. The stations have been further clustered following the 63 and 125 Hz bands noise levels. Average SPL levels resulted similar to those previously computed for proximate areas, indicating that the Adriatic Sea sub-region experiences high noise pressure in the marine waters. In its turn this claims for a scientific and technical international cooperation, as requested by the EU programme. No seasonal variation in local noise levels has been found. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Aging causes morphological alterations in astrocytes and microglia in human substantia nigra pars compacta,"Jyothi, HJ; Vidyadhara, DJ; Mahadevan, A; Philip, M; Parmar, SK; Manohari, SG; Shankar, SK; Raju, TR; Alladi, PA","Age being a risk factor for Parkinson's disease, assessment of age-related changes in the human substantia nigra may elucidate its pathogenesis. Increase in Marinesco bodies, alpha-synuclein, free radicals and so forth in the aging nigral neurons are clear indicators of neurodegeneration. Here, we report the glial responses in aging human nigra. The glial numbers were determined on Nissl-stained sections. The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100 beta, 2', 3'-cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase, and Iba1 was assessed on cryosections of autopsied midbrains by immunohistochemistry and densitometry. The glial counts showed a biphasic increase, of which, the first prominent phase from fetal age to birth could be physiological gliogenesis whereas the second one after middle age may reflect mild age-related gliosis. Astrocytic morphology was altered, but glial fibrillary acidic protein expression increased only mildly. Presence of type-4 microglia suggests possibility of neuroinflammation. Mild reduction in 2', 3'-cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase-labeled area denotes subtle demyelination. Stable age-related S100 beta expression indicates absence of calcium overload. Against the expected prominent gliosis, subtle age-related morphological alterations in human nigral glia attribute them a participatory role in aging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Management of marine resources through a local governance perspective: Re-implementation of traditions for marine resource recovery on Easter Island,"Aburto, JA; Gaymer, CF; Haoa, S; Gonzalez, L","Easter Island (Rapa Nui) is one of the most isolated places in the world. The local Rapanui people have noticed an extreme decline in marine resources, which is due to the exploitation of these resources. Top-down regulations (e.g. fisherman and boat registrations and restrictions on catch-length and fishing season and location) implemented by the central fishery authorities located similar to 4000 km from the island do not represent the cultural heritage and interests of the Rapanui people. According to the local people, one of the traditional ways to protect marine resources was the taboo (or tapu in Rapa Nui) that regulated the fish harvest. Key informants were interviewed to assess what they knew about the tapu in fisheries and so that the feasibility of its implementation could be assessed based on current local conditions. The tapu that had the greatest potential impact on regulating open water resources, especially tuna, was the traditional belief that consumption of open-water fish during winter months would cause asthma. According to the interviewees, the real reason for this tapu was to protect the fish during its reproductive period, and the asthma threat was only a way to enforce the restriction. At present, tapu is not respected because of the high economic activity related to the tourism that demands fish like tuna all year. Even though many Rapanui people agree that tapu re-implementation would be the best alternative to recover marine resources, people also think it is difficult to implement under modern conditions. We propose to promote a participatory process for development of a local governance structure that will use local traditions and beliefs, including tapu, to support the local decision-making process for reverting the decline of marine resources.

Benchmarking for data-limited fishery systems to support collaborative focus on solutions,"Stratoudakis, Y; Azevedo, M; Farias, I; Macedo, C; Moura, T; Polvora, MJ; Rosa, C; Figueiredo, I","Stakeholder participation is a key feature in risk-based frameworks used to assess and promote sustainable exploitation in fishery systems, but participants usually have a limited opportunity to influence the scope and rules of interaction. Here, an extension of this approach of stakeholder engagement is described and tested in a context where the scope and rules of interaction are decided by the participants themselves. Demonstration is based on a deep-water long-line fishery for black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) off mainland Portugal. Managers, scientists and fishery representatives were invited to interact within a facilitated environment with the aim of improving understanding of main problems in the system and of negotiating solutions meaningful to all participants. Mismatches between the scale of biological processes and those at which exploitation is assessed and managed across the Northeast Atlantic and other weaknesses of the fishery system were rapidly identified during an interactive workshop of benchmarking against the Marine Stewardship Council sustainability standard. Specific proposals for action were iteratively developed within the group and evaluated in terms of perceived cost and scope for action. Finally, problems were prioritized in terms of a cumulative score of gravity of anticipated impact, urgency of action and likely degradation rate during a period of inaction to highlight issues most likely to be resolved by the group. The stage-wise approach presented here can be replicated to create or to revise strategies for resolving problems in data-limited fisheries and can be extended to incorporate other critical stakeholders and other tools to stimulate group interaction and joint deliberation.

Study and Test of a New Bundle-Structure Riser Stress Monitoring Sensor Based on FBG,"Xu, J; Yang, DX; Qin, C; Jiang, YJ; Sheng, LX; Jia, XY; Bai, Y; Shen, XH; Wang, HY; Deng, X; Xu, LB; Jiang, SQ","To meet the requirements of riser safety monitoring in offshore oil fields, a new Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)-based bundle-structure riser stress monitoring sensor has been developed. In cooperation with many departments, a 49-day marine test in water depths of 1365 m and 1252 m was completed on the HYSY-981 ocean oil drilling platform. No welding and pasting were used when the sensor was installed on risers. Therefore, the installation is convenient, reliable and harmless to risers. The continuous, reasonable, time-consistent data obtained indicates that the sensor worked normally under water. In all detailed working conditions, the test results show that the sensor can do well in reflecting stresses and bending moments both in and in magnitude. The measured maximum stress is 132.7 MPa, which is below the allowable stress. In drilling and testing conditions, the average riser stress was 86.6 MPa, which is within the range of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) mechanical simulation results.",2015,,SENSORS,15,11,29648-29660,WOS:000365686400117,10.3390/s151129648,,#19900,Xu 2015,,
Perceptions on incentives for compliance with regulation. The case of Spanish fishermen in the Atlantic,"Garza-Gil, MD; Amigo-Dobano, L; Suris-Regueiro, JC; Varela-Lafuente, M","Illegal and unreported fishing undermines efforts to preserve marine resources because regulators may not be able to achieve their management objectives. The European Commission and the Spanish government have implemented a regulatory framework to try to deter illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing based on sanctions for those who do not comply. This work analyses the perceptions of Spanish fishermen who fish in the Atlantic, regarding monetary and non-monetary incentives/disincentives. In addition, the participation of various institutions in the process for the development and control of fishing regulations and the possible participation of fishermen and other stakeholders is analyzed. The results show that fishermen give a higher value to sanctioning defaulters than to rewarding compliers. In the decision-making process they also significantly value a greater involvement of the fishermen themselves and of the regional governments. However, fishermen value positively that the monitoring be carried out by public institutions and not by other agents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The associations of anthropometric measurements with subsequent gestational diabetes in Aboriginal women,"Sina, M; Hoy, WE; Callaway, L; Wang, ZQ","Problem: To evaluate the associations of different anthropometric measurements on earlier exam with subsequent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in Aboriginal women.Methods: This is a nested case-control study. Anthropometric measurements were conducted at baseline from 1992 to 1995 in a remote Aboriginal community. All subsequent pregnancies among the original participants were identified through review of hospital records of 20 years. Thirty-two women developed GDM and 99 women were hospitalised for pregnancy-related conditions other than GDM. The association between body mass index (BMI), weight, height, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-height ratio with subsequent GDM was examined.Results: Our results showed an increased risk of GDM with increase in one standard deviation of BMI (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.3, 3.1), weight (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.7), waist circumference (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.0) and waist-to-height ratio (OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.4, 3.9). High BMI (BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)) was associated with subsequent GDM (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.0, 7.8).Conclusions: BMI and waist-to-height ratio are better predictors than other anthropometric indices of GDM in Aboriginal women. Given that these measures are associated with future GDM, interventions to reduce BMI, weight and waist circumference in young women need to be assessed for their potential to prevent GDM.

"Youth and the sea: Ocean literacy in Nova Scotia, Canada","Guest, H; Lotze, HK; Wallace, D","Improving public awareness about the ocean can benefit the environment, economy, and society. However, low levels of 'ocean literacy' have been identified in many countries and can be a barrier for citizens to engage in environmentally responsible behavior or consider ocean-related careers. This study assessed the level of ocean valuation, knowledge, interaction and interest of public school students grade 7-12 (ages 12-18) in Nova Scotia, Canada, a region with strong connections with the sea. A survey was used in 11 public schools, with a total of 723 students participating in a quiz and survey. Many quiz questions were aligned with the 'Ocean Literacy Principles' established by the Ocean Literacy Campaign in the United States. Although the average quiz score was below 50%, students reported a high valuation of the marine environment and diverse interest in the oceans, including jobs and careers. There was a distinct difference in knowledge of biology-related questions and abiotic-related questions, with students having more knowledge of and interest in topics concerning ocean life. A significant positive correlation between knowledge and value indicated that ocean-literate students might value the marine environment more strongly. Students reporting greater interaction with the ocean also demonstrated higher knowledge levels, and students with higher knowledge levels were more likely to be interested in ocean-related jobs and careers. Participants' high valuation of the marine environment and interest in ocean jobs and careers suggests important links between ocean literacy and environmental and economic benefit, respectively. Enhancing interactions with the ocean through experiential learning could be the most effective way of improving ocean literacy as well as marine citizen- and stewardship. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Capability-oriented robot architecture for maritime autonomy,"Insaurralde, CC; Petillot, YR","Advanced ocean systems are increasing their capabilities and the degree of autonomy more and more in order to perform more sophisticated maritime missions. Remotely operated vehicles are no longer cost-effective since they are limited by economic support costs, and the presence and skills of the human operator. Alternatively, autonomous surface and underwater vehicles have the potential to operate with greatly reduced overhead costs and level of operator intervention. This paper proposes an Intelligent Control Architecture (ICA) to enable multiple collaborating marine vehicles to autonomously carry out underwater intervention missions. The ICA is generic in nature but aimed at a case study where a marine surface craft and an underwater vehicle are required to work cooperatively. They are capable of cooperating autonomously towards the execution of complex activities since they have different but complementary capabilities. The architectural foundation to achieve the ICA lays on the flexibility of serviceoriented computing and agent technology. An ontological database captures the operator skills, platform capabilities and, changes in the environment. The information captured, stored as knowledge, enables reasoning agents to plan missions based on the current situation. The ICA implementation is verified and early validated in simulations by means of a team of two above autonomous marine robots. This paper also presents architectural details and evaluation scenarios of the ICA, results of simulations from different maritime operations, and future research directions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Experiments on sampling/patrolling with two Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"Marino, A; Antonelli, G","In this paper, an experimental investigation of the sampling/patrolling tasks by means of cooperative underwater vehicles is presented. Both in the case of sampling and patrolling, the mission consists in periodically visiting proper locations of the environment in order to estimate the field of interest or check for unexpected events. In previous work of the same authors, it has been shown that these tasks can be addressed by a proper combination of Gaussian Processes and Voronoi tessellation tools. The Gaussian Processes allow to put these tasks in a probabilistic framework, while the Voronoi tessellation allows to distribute the overall strategy as well as the handling of asynchronous communication or possible loss or adjunct of vehicles. The approach was already tested in simulation by varying all the parameters of interest as well as on a set-up composed by three marine surface vehicles. In this paper, experiments are extended to the still challenging scenario of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) communicating by acoustic modems and moving in the 3D space. The experiments were run in the La Spezia harbour, in Italy, as demo of the European project CO(3)AUV5. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Global patterns in the bycatch of sharks and rays,"Oliver, S; Braccini, M; Newman, SJ; Harvey, ES","This study comprised a meta-analysis of elasmobranch bycatch in commercial longline, trawl, purse-seine and gillnet fisheries in order to obtain a general perspective of bycatch patterns, and to expose knowledge gaps and identify management and research priorities. Two bycatch ratios were considered: the number and the weight of elasmobranch bycatch relative to that of the target species captured. Patterns were determined through machine learning algorithms with gear type, oceanic region, habitat and the presence or absence of bycatch management measures as candidate predictors. There are considerable information gaps. Most of the current information on elasmobranch bycatch is for the North Atlantic, which is not where the greatest fishing pressure is exerted, so several fisheries were largely under-represented. Overall for sharks, gear type was the most important predictor with pelagic longline fisheries in the South Atlantic displaying the highest bycatch ratios. No patterns were found for ray bycatch ratios. For the fisheries considered in this study, pelagic longlines, and deep-sea and coastal trawl fisheries had the largest total annual shark and ray bycatch, respectively. Blue sharks (Prionace glauca, Carcharhinidae) dominated the total annual bycatch of longline fisheries. For other fishing gears, the annual species-specific bycatch composition varied across oceanic regions. Many of the fisheries with the largest elasmobranch bycatch operate over large spatial scales and often in international waters. International management, mitigation and cooperation are an essential component for the sustainability of elasmobranch bycatch species. Data collection systems and data availability are required at a global scale to improve assessments of elasmobranch bycatch and this should be a high priority for ongoing management and monitoring.

The pace and progress of adaptation: Marine climate change preparedness in Australia's coastal communities,"Bradley, M; van Putten, I; Sheaves, M","This study provides an assessment of local government progress in adaptation to marine climate change in Australia's coastal communities. Globally, coastal communities are vulnerable to a diversity of marine climate change impacts, and adaptation responses will need to be tailored to suit each unique socio-ecological situation. The responsibility of adaptation planning is largely placed on municipal councils, yet much of this activity goes unreported in the peer-reviewed literature. Through a meta-analysis of municipal planning documents this study reveals that in general, progress is in the early stages. Many councils have no plans, and the presence of plans seems to be related to the magnitude of council income as well as participation in regional or international adaptation networks. Of those councils that do have plans, only half have progressed beyond the 'understanding the problem' phase. Additionally, the focus of marine adaptation planning is generally restricted to one driver - sea level rise. Changing sea surface temperatures and ocean acidification were largely ignored, despite predicted impacts on coastal ecosystems and the communities that interact and depend on them. While it is often assumed that developed countries have the capacity to adapt to climate change, this study indicates that for some important aspects of marine change in Australia, this capacity is not always translated into action by local councils. The development and refinement of progress indicators such as those used in this study will be increasingly important as tools for establishing baselines and tracking adaptation into the future.

An experimental analysis of assignment problems and economic rent dissipation in quota managed fisheries,"Emery, TJ; Tisdell, J; Green, BS; Hartmann, K; Gardner, C; Leon, R","Assignment problems may remain in quota managed fisheries due to variation in the productivity of the stock across space and time. Unless fishers can agree to coordinate their fishing effort, they will compete amongst themselves and over-exploit the stock where or when the quota unit value is highest, leading to economic rent dissipation. Coordination may be made more difficult in a dynamic marine environment when groups are heterogeneous and cannot communicate amongst themselves. To investigate this supposition, a series of economic experiments were conducted using university students. Participants took on the role of either a quota owner or lease quota fisher and in the presence or absence of communication were asked to make individual harvesting decisions, which allowed researchers to assess the relative influence of these factors on group coordination. This study found that participants were more likely to make socially optimal decisions to prevent rent dissipation when they could communicate and were in an experimental group containing solely quota owners. Participants who were lease quota fishers were less likely to make socially optimal decisions due to: (i) inequality in wealth; (ii) insecurity of tenure; and (iii) asymmetric information exchange. As participants were aware of these disparities, it negatively affected the ability of heterogeneous groups to establish trust and a sense of identity, despite being able to communicate. While requiring further exposition in the field, these results provide a theoretical insight into the difficulties heterogeneous fishers may have in solving assignment problems in a dynamic environment.

Ornamental reef fish fisheries: New indicators of sustainability and human development at a coastal community level,"Germain, N; Hartmann, HJ; Melo, FJFR; Reyes-Bonilla, H","Ensuring sustainable fisheries and community development requires integrating and harmonizing the environmental, social and economic issues which in turn might lead to effective management plans. This paper describes a new methodology based on the Human Development Index (HDI). We transformed the HDI to adapt it to local and specific purposes and create a new set of indicators for assessing the sustainability of ornamental fish fisheries and the human development at a community level for the inhabitants linked to this activity. We chose a women-owned and operated marine ornamental fish business located along the coast of the Gulf of California as a study case. Socio-economic data, obtained in 2011 from the women associates and the inhabitants of their coastal community, show that monthly income and living conditions were still very modest. Results indicated an intermediate development and financially unsustainable but ecologically sustainable fisheries for the aquarium market. As captures, based on authorized and managed quotas by the Mexican Government, revealed an under-exploitation, a participatory SWOT analysis of the ornamental fish cooperative was carried out in order to provide information about the cooperative's current situation which helped to produce future business strategies to optimize the company's operations in a sustainable way. Our conclusion is that the cooperative is still ""young"" and needs time to stabilize in order to generate enough profits that would enable its women associates to increase their standard of living while respecting the sustainability of the marine resources. We also noted that such a business activity can be a good employment opportunity in small communities, regardless of gender, and that its sustainability is closely linked to ecological, and socio-economic factors.

Introduction to CCE-LTER: Responses of the California Current Ecosystem to climate forcing,"Goericke, R; Ohman, MD","The California Current Ecosystem Long Term Ecological Research (CCE-LTER) site has been in existence since 2004. One of its primary objectives is to understand the response of the southern California Current ecosystem to climate forcing. The CCE-LTER site cooperates with the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program and complements CalCOFI's work through more extensive observations, process studies, and a modeling program. This special issue is focused on the long-term observations made by the CCE-LTER and CalCOFI programs, describing and understanding long-term changes in the physical, chemical, and biotic environment in the region. The papers in this issue highlight the climatological conditions during recent years and employ modeling to diagnose the principal forcing of meridional currents and eddy transport, both of which affect biotic responses. Changes in source waters in the region, and altered flushing of the Santa Barbara Basin, are considered. Temporal variations in inherent optical properties and in higher trophic levels, including seabirds and marine mammals, are presented. Key methodological developments presented include the incorporation of subsurface phytoplankton and light distributions in order to improve remotely sensed measures of primary production, and the validation of multi-frequency acoustic estimates of mesopelagic fish biomass. Results also highlight significant spatial differences across the CCE-LTER region, including cross-shore trends in microbial assemblages, and glider-resolved frontal features and zones of mixing associated with abrupt topography. Alterations to the spatial structure of the pelagic ecosystem must also be considered when evaluating future climate-related changes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Testing the water: Understanding stakeholder readiness for strategic coastal and marine management,"Mason, CM; Lim-Camacho, L; Scheepers, K; Parr, JM","We argue that stakeholder commitment and cooperation is essential for the success of strategic coastal and marine management initiatives and draw upon social identity theory to explain how inter-group relationships can either support or hinder cooperation across stakeholder groups. We analyse data from interviews carried out with 24 coastal and marine stakeholders from the Northern Territory, Australia, looking at how stakeholders describe their objectives for coastal and marine management and evidence of social identity effects either facilitating or impeding cooperation between stakeholders. While most participants sought improvements to coastal and marine management, only some were thinking in terms of a more regional-scale, forward-looking and integrated approach. Strong social identity effects inhibiting cooperation between stakeholders were evident in many of the interviews. However, the interviews also revealed shared objectives (e.g., the need for more data, to avoid duplication of effort, and more transparent and systematic decision-making) that could serve as a basis for developing a common social identity, and fostering the commitment and cooperation needed for strategic coastal and marine management initiatives.

Private incentives for the emergence of co-production of offshore wind energy and mussel aquaculture,"Griffin, R; Buck, B; Krause, G","Technological solutions to increase the efficiency of spatial use can play a key role as part of the toolbox of marine spatial planning. Co-locating of multiple ocean uses can potentially increase the production and enjoyment of the ocean while limiting impacts. However, a basic precondition for co-locating or coproduction is that all parties' private incentives are aligned. We use a case study of co-locating an offshore wind energy firm and a mussel aquaculture firm to assess the incentive structure for cooperation and to demonstrate that social benefits from co-locating exist. We find that there is room for cooperation between firms based on potential cost sharing and that the demonstrated social benefits may arise without government intervention. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluating conditions for transboundary Marine Spatial Planning: Challenges and opportunities on the island of Ireland,"Flannery, W; O'Hagan, AM; O'Mahony, C; Ritchie, H; Twomey, S","Transboundary cooperation is viewed as an essential element of Marine Spatial Planning (MSP). While much of the MSP literature focuses on the need for, and benefits of, transboundary MSP, this paper explores the political and institutional factors that may facilitate the effective transition to such an approach. Drawing on transboundary planning theory and practice, key contextual factors that are likely to expedite the transition to transboundary MSP are reviewed. These include: policy convergence in neighbouring jurisdictions; prior experience of transboundary planning; and good working relations amongst key actors. Based on this review, an assessment of the conditions for transboundary MSP in the adjoining waters of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is undertaken. A number of recommendations are then advanced for transboundary MSP on the island of Ireland, including, the need to address the role of formal transboundary institutions and the lack of an agreed legal maritime boundary. The paper concludes with some commentary on the political realities of implementing transboundary MSP. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper, which was produced under IAEA's Environmental Modelling for Radiation Safety (EMRAS) II programme, describes an evaluation of how models can be applied to radionuclide contaminated wetlands. Participants used combinations of aquatic and terrestrial model parameters to assess exposure. Results show the importance of occupancy factor and food source (aquatic or terrestrial) included. The influence of soil saturation conditions on external dose rates is also apparent. In general, terrestrial parameters provided acceptable predictions for wetland organisms.

Regional cooperation for European seas: Governance models in support of the implementation of the MSFD,"van Tatenhove, J; Raakjaer, J; van Leeuwen, J; van Hoof, L","During the implementation process of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), Member States are expected to cooperate and coordinate at the regional sea level as wells as arrange stakeholder involvement. However, the MSFD does not specify any governing structures to do so. The aim of this paper is to address these key challenges of the MSFD by developing four governance models for regional cooperation and assess their impact on governance performance. The four models are based on the building blocks of stakeholder involvement (low or high) and decision-making power (binding or nonbinding decisions): (1) Cross-border platforms; (2) Regional Sea Convention-PLUS; (3) Advisory Alliance and (4) Regional Sea Assembly. Secondly, the paper will do an ex ante assessment on how the alternative models will have an impact on governance performance. The assessment criteria for governance performance are: (a) costs to set up and run a model; (b) capacity to cooperate; (c) policy coordination; (d) institutional ambiguity; and (e) implementation drift. In addition to this assessment of the performance based on expert judgement (i.e. scientists of WP7 of the ODEMM project), 4 roundtable discussions have been undertaken in which stakeholders from the four regional seas did an assessment of the four models. The main conclusion is that increasing stakeholder participation, a much desired development in regional organisation of marine management as expressed by the stakeholder community, will increase the costs of the policy making process. If stakeholder participation is not embedded in a wider institutional setting in which the participation of stakeholders is directly related to the policy process and the degree to which decisions taken are binding, the increase of costs does not lead to a more smoothly running model.

The current status of west sea fisheries resources and utilization in the context of fishery management of Korea,"Zhang, CI; Lim, JH; Kwon, Y; Kang, HJ; Kim, DH; Seo, YI","Many fisheries resources in Korean waters are known to be depleted, and thus annual catch and catch per unit of effort of Korean coastal and offshore fisheries have shown a declining pattern. Moreover, some ecological indices have exhibited continuous declines, indicating degraded conditions in quality as well as quantity of fisheries resources. Considering the current circumstances, in this paper we review the marine ecosystem, fisheries resources, the history of fisheries management, and the present status of assessment and management of Korean west sea (the eastern part of the Yellow Sea) fisheries. Then, we attempt to identify problems and issues for the fisheries management. This paper introduces an ecosystem-based fisheries assessment and management approach as an alternative and applies it to a Korean coastal ecosystem in the west sea, Korea. Policy implications are suggested, which can be drawn from the discussions on the problerhs and concerns in current fisheries assessment and management in general. These suggestions include an efficient assessment and management system to prevent overfishing, protect biodiversity and habitat quality, and support expanded research, data collection, monitoring, and a multidisciplinary international cooperation with neighboring countries, such as China and Japan.

Cooperation and compliance control in areas beyond national jurisdiction,"Englender, D; Kirschey, J; Stofen, A; Zink, A","Past decades have shown a constant increase in the number of international agreements regulating marine areas. Environmental changes as well as technological developments resulting in an increased use of oceans ensure the need for further governance in the future of high seas. At the same time, compliance by States with international obligations remains a considerable challenge in international law. In particular, regulations governing areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) are at risk of not being obeyed due to factual challenges posed to the control of high seas territories and the (legal) limits of the law of the sea. This article evaluates a stronger cooperation between States through the incorporation of compliance control systems in agreements regulating ABNJ in order to enhance compliance by States. For this purpose, provisions on compliance control measures which have already been established in two agreements regulating ABNJ, namely the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement, are analyzed. It is argued that the incorporation of compliance control elements into agreements regulating ABNJ is a promising avenue to secure improved compliance among States Parties and further implementation of this approach is recommended.

Participation and post-normal science in practice? Reality check for hazardous chemicals management in the European marine environment,"Udovyk, O; Gilek, M","This study analyses whether science-policy interactions linked to the management of hazardous chemicals in the European marine environment have developed in accordance with general theories on public involvement in policymaking in general and post-normal science (PNS) in particular. Special attention is given to a comparison between key EU policy frameworks, namely the ""polluter-oriented"" registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH) and the ""environment-oriented"" Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), based on in-depth analysis of key policy-related documents and interviews with scientists and policy actors.The results outline that in spite of a substantial amount of rhetoric in EU sources about recommending wide and ambitious public involvement, current participation and deliberation practices are rather undeveloped in the studied EU policy frameworks. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the introduction of more radical approaches to knowledge co-production and participation (like PNS) would require epistemological, institutional and constitutional changes that are not feasible in the foreseeable future, at least not in respect to chemicals management.This study generates empirical data with regard to the management of chemicals in the European marine environment, specifically data on participation, the role of science, and uncertainty treatment at the science-policy interface. These data provide empirical information that can be used by environmental managers involved in the development of EU marine policy. At the same time, the results can be used theoretically to reflect on and problematise the current state of wider public participation in EU environmental policies and PNS development in particular cases.

Using the integrated ecosystem assessment framework to build consensus and transfer information to managers,"Fletcher, PJ; Kelble, CR; Nuttle, WK; Kiker, GA","Ecosystem-based management is widely regarded as a method to improve the way we manage our coastal marine resources and ecosystems. Effective ecosystem-based management relies upon synthesizing our scientific knowledge and transferring this knowledge into management actions. Integrated ecosystem assessment is a framework to conduct this scientific synthesis and transfer information to resource managers. Portions of the framework were applied to build consensus on the focal ecosystem components and processes that are characteristic of a sustainable South Florida coastal ecosystem that is producing ecosystem services at the level society desires. Consensus was developed through facilitated meetings that aimed to conceptualize the ecosystem, develop ecosystem indicators, and conduct risk analysis. Resource managers, researchers, academics, and non-governmental organizations participated in these meetings and contributed to the synthesis of science and a myriad of science communications to transfer information to decision makers and the public. A proof of concept Bayesian Belief Network was developed to explore integrating the results of this assessment into an interactive management scenario evaluation tool. The four year effort resulted in the development of a research and management coordination network in South Florida that should provide the foundation for implementing ecosystem-based resource management across multiple agencies.

Securing blue wealth: The need for a special sustainable development goal for the ocean and coasts,"Visbeck, M; Kronfeld-Goharani, U; Neumann, B; Rickels, W; Schmidt, J; van Doom, E; Matz-Luck, N; Ott, K; Quaas, MF","The ocean regulates the global climate, provides humans with natural resources such as food, materials, important substances, and energy, and is essential for international trade and recreational and cultural activities. Together with human development and economic growth, free access to, and availability of, ocean resources and services have exerted strong pressure on marine systems, ranging from overfishing, increasing resource extraction, and alteration of coastal zones to various types of thoughtless pollution. Both economic theory and many case studies suggest that there is no ""tragedy of the commons"" but a ""tragedy of open access"". With high likeliness, structures of open access are non-sustainable. International cooperation and effective governance are required to protect the marine environment and promote the sustainable use of marine resources in such a way that due account can be taken of the environmental values of current generations and the needs of future generations. For this purpose, developing and agreeing on one Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) specifically for the Ocean and Coasts could prove to be an essential element. The new SDGs will build upon the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and replace them by 2015. Ensuring environmental sustainability in a general sense is one of the eight MDGs but the ocean is not explicitly addressed. Furthermore, the creation of a comprehensive underlying set of ocean sustainability targets and effective indicators developed within a global Future Ocean Spatial Planning (FOSP) process would help in assessing the current status of marine systems, diagnosing ongoing trends, and providing information for inclusive, forward-looking, and sustainable ocean governance.

Developing a rapid method for undertaking the World Ocean Assessment in data-poor regions - A case study using the South China Sea Large Marine Ecosystem,"Feary, DA; Fowler, AM; Ward, TJ","The United Nations Environment Program, World Ocean Assessment, requires rapid assessment of the state of marine ecosystems at regional scales, yet a practical method for achieving this in data-poor regions has not been developed. We present a method that is capable of synthesising information across a broad range of ecosystem components in a timely manner, while also overcoming the paucity of empirical data available at large spatial scales. We develop a hierarchical and adaptable assessment framework that encompasses 'Biodiversity', 'Ecosystem health' and 'Environmental pressure' components, which are further divided into parameters (representing the structure and/or function of each component) and indicators (which indicate the spatial distribution of the assessed parameter). We argue that this framework is best utilised within an expert elicitation process. To determine the validity of this framework in undertaking a WOA, this approach was applied to the South China Sea Large Marine Ecosystem during a 3-day pilot workshop held in Bangkok. Thailand, 2012. Forty-five experts from 11 countries in the region participated in assessing the biodiversity, ecosystem health and environmental pressures structuring 104 pre-identified ecosystem variables. The majority of areas within the SCS were graded as 'Poor' in terms of their biodiversity, with biodiversity in decline within 64% of these variables. In contrast, most areas were graded as 'Good' for ecosystem health, with 51% of variables considered stable in terms of ecosystem health. However, most areas were graded as 'Poor' for ecosystem pressures, with pressures either stable or increasing. Ecosystem variables in 'Poor' or 'Very Poor' condition in Most (80%) of areas were identified as conservation priorities. These variables were primarily associated with groups of taxa, including elasmobranch fauna, inner-shelf demersal fishes, squid and large invertebrate species inhabiting reefs (e.g., giant clam). A range of iconic species (e.g., dugong), key habitats (e.g., coral reefs), and key ecosystem processes (e.g., benthic productivity) were also graded as 'Poor' in Most (80%) of areas. Confidence in condition and trend scores was assessed to be medium or high for 86% of variables assessed. The rapid method developed here assessed and conveyed to policy-makers a broad-scale overview of the condition, trends and issues in the SCS. The method provides a way forward for future World Ocean Assessments of large data-poor marine ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Association of body mass index and prostate cancer mortality,"Haque, R; Van Den Eeden, SK; Wallner, LP; Richert-Boe, K; Kallakury, B; Wang, RY; Weinmann, S","Objectives: Inconsistent evidence exists on whether obesity is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer death post-radical prostatectomy. We examined data from three large health plans to evaluate if an increased body mass index (BMI) at prostate cancer diagnosis is related to prostate cancer mortalitySubjects and methods: This population-based case-control study included 751 men with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy. Cases were men who died due to prostate cancer (N = 323) and matched controls (N = 428). We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess the association between BMI at diagnosis and prostate cancer mortality, adjusted for Gleason score, PSA, tumour characteristics, and matching factors.Results: Study subjects were classified into the following BMI (kg/m(2)) categories: healthy (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9) and obese (>= 30). Nearly 43% of the participants had a BMI >= 25 at diagnosis. A higher fraction of cases (30%) were obese compared to controls (22%). Overall, obese men had more than a 50% increase in prostate cancer mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 1.50 [95% CI, 1.03-2.19]) when compared to men with healthy BMI. After stratifying by Gleason score, the odds of mortality generally rose with increasing BMI. The strongest effect was observed in the Gleason score 8+ category (2.37, 95% CI: 1.11-5.09). These associations persisted after adjusting for PSA at diagnosis and other tumour characteristics.Conclusions: These results suggest that BMI at diagnosis is strongly correlated with prostate cancer mortality, and that men with aggressive disease have a markedly greater odds of death if they are overweight or obese.

Radio-ecological characterization and radiological assessment in support of regulatory supervision of legacy sites in northwest Russia,"Sneve, MK; Kiselev, M; Shandala, NK","The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority has been implementing a regulatory cooperation program in the Russian Federation for over 10 years, as part of the Norwegian government's Plan of Action for enhancing nuclear and radiation safety in northwest Russia. The overall long-term objective has been the enhancement of safety culture and includes a special focus on regulatory supervision of nuclear legacy sites. The initial project outputs included appropriate regulatory threat assessments, to determine the hazardous situations and activities which are most in need of enhanced regulatory supervision. In turn, this has led to the development of new and updated norms and standards, and related regulatory procedures, necessary to address the often abnormal conditions at legacy sites.This paper presents the experience gained within the above program with regard to radio-ecological characterization of Sites of Temporary Storage for spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste at Andreeva Bay and Gremikha in the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia. Such characterization is necessary to support assessments of the current radiological situation and to support prospective assessments of its evolution. Both types of assessments contribute to regulatory supervision of the sites. Accordingly, they include assessments to support development of regulatory standards and guidance concerning: control of radiation exposures to workers during remediation operations; emergency preparedness and response; planned radionuclide releases to the environment; development of site restoration plans, and waste treatment and disposal. Examples of characterization work are presented which relate to terrestrial and marine environments at Andreeva Bay. The use of this data in assessments is illustrated by means of the visualization and assessment tool (DATAMAP) developed as part of the regulatory cooperation program, specifically to help control radiation exposure in operations and to support regulatory analysis of management options. For assessments of the current radiological situation, the types of data needed include information about the distribution of radionuclides in environmental media. For prognostic assessments, additional data are needed about the landscape features, on-shore and off-shore hydrology, geochemical properties of soils and sediments, and possible continuing source terms from continuing operations and on-site disposal. It is anticipated that shared international experience in legacy site characterization can be useful in the next steps. Although the output has been designed to support regulatory evaluation of these particular sites in northwest Russia, the methods and techniques are considered useful examples for application elsewhere, as well as providing relevant input to the International Atomic Energy Agency's international Working Forum for the Regulatory Supervision of Legacy Sites.

Patient and physician characteristics associated with the provision of weight loss counseling in primary care,"Dutton, GR; Herman, KG; Tan, F; Goble, M; Dancer-Brown, M; Van Vessem, N; Ard, JD","Background: A variety of physician and patient characteristics may influence whether weight loss counseling occurs in primary care encounters.Objectives: This study utilized a cross-sectional survey of primary care patients, which examined patient characteristics, physician characteristics, and characteristics of the physician patient relationship associated with weight loss counseling and recommendations provided by physicians.Participants: (N = 143, mean age = 46.8 years, mean BMI = 36.9 kg/m2, 65% Caucasian) were overweight and obese primary care patients participating in a managed care weight loss program.Measures: Participants completed self-report surveys in the clinic prior to the initial weight loss session. Surveys included items assessing demographic/background characteristics, weight, height, and a health care questionnaire evaluating whether their physician had recommended weight loss, the frequency of their physicians' weight loss counseling, and whether their physician had referred them for obesity treatment.Results: Patient BMI and physician sex were most consistently associated with physicians' weight loss counseling practices. Patients seen by female physicians were more likely to be told that they should lose weight, received more frequent obesity counseling, and were more likely to have been referred for obesity treatment by their physician. Length and frequency of physician patient contacts were unrelated to the likelihood of counseling.Conclusions: These findings add to previous evidence suggesting possible differences in the weight loss counseling practices of male and female physicians, although further research is needed to understand this potential difference between physicians.

Pollution status of the Bohai Sea: An overview of the environmental quality assessment related trace metals,"Gao, XL; Zhou, FX; Chen, CTA","It is well recognized that the ecosystem of the Bohai Sea is being rapidly degraded and the Sea has basically lost its function as a fishing ground. Billions of funds have been spent in slowing down, halting and finally reversing the environmental deterioration of the Bohai Sea. Although trace metals are routinely monitored, the data with high temporal resolution for a clear understanding of biogeochemical processes in the ecosystem of the Bohai Sea are insufficient, especially in the western literature. In this review, status of trace metal contamination in the Bohai Sea is assessed based on a comprehensive review of their concentrations recorded in the waters, sediments and organisms over the past decades. Studies show that metal contamination in the Bohai Sea is closely associated with the fast economic growth in the past decades. Concentrations of trace metals are high in coastal areas especially in the estuaries. Alarmingly high metal concentrations are observed in the waters, sediments and organisms from the western Bohai Bay and the northern Liaodong Bay, especially the coasts near Huludao in the northernmost area of the Bohai Sea, which is being polluted by industrial sewage from the surrounding areas. The knowledge of the speciation and fractionation of trace metals and the influence of submarine groundwater discharge on the biogeochemistry of trace metals in the Bohai Sea is far from enough and related work needs to be done urgently to get a better understanding of the influence of trace metals on the ecosystem of the Bohai Sea. A clear understanding of the trace metal pollution status of the Bohai Sea could not be achieved presently for lack of systematic cooperation in different research fields. It is quite necessary to apply the environmental and ecological modeling to the investigation of trace metals in the Bohai Sea and then provide foundations for the protection of the environment and ecosystem of the Bohai Sea.

Measurement of body composition changes during weight loss in obese men using multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis and multi-compartment models,"Johnstone, AM; Faber, P; Gibney, ER; Lobley, GE; Stubbs, RJ; Siervo, M","Background: The accurate measurement of changes in body composition is important to assess the contribution of fat and fat free mass to total body mass change as a measure of the effectiveness of weight loss programmes. Bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) is a rapid and non-invasive technique which could be applied to assess body composition changes. The aim of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of the BIS for the measurement of fat mass (FM), total body water (TBW) and extracellular water (ECW) changes induced by different degrees of caloric deficit in obese men.Methods: Three groups of six, obese men participated in either (i) a total fast (for 6 days); (ii) a VLCD (2.5 MJ/day for 3 weeks); or (iii) LCD (5.2 MJ/day for 6 weeks). FM was measured using a 4-compartment (4-C) model. TBW and ECW were determined by dilution methods, respectively. TBW, ECW and FM were also assessed with BIS.Results: Body weight loss in the fasting group was 6.0 +/- 1.3 kg over 6 days; the VLCD group lost 9.2 +/- 1.2 kg over 21 days and the LCD group lost 12.6 +/- 2.4 kg over 42 days. BIS underestimated FM changes (bias = -3.3 +/- 3.8 kg) and overestimated changes in TBW and ECW by +1.8 +/- 4.8 kg and +2.3 +/- 6.4 kg, respectively. The measurement error was consistently larger in the fasting group and the magnitude of the bias interacted significantly with the rate of weight loss.Conclusion: Rapid weight loss affects the accuracy of the BIS in detecting changes in body composition. A careful interpretation of the results is needed when sizable changes in body water compartments occurs. (c) 2012 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of New Zealand's High-Seas Bottom Trawl Closures Using Predictive Habitat Models and Quantitative Risk Assessment,"Penney, AJ; Guinotte, JM","United Nations General Assembly Resolution 61/105 on sustainable fisheries (UNGA 2007) establishes three difficult questions for participants in high-seas bottom fisheries to answer: 1) Where are vulnerable marine systems (VMEs) likely to occur?; 2) What is the likelihood of fisheries interaction with these VMEs?; and 3) What might qualify as adequate conservation and management measures to prevent significant adverse impacts? This paper develops an approach to answering these questions for bottom trawling activities in the Convention Area of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) within a quantitative risk assessment and cost : benefit analysis framework. The predicted distribution of deep-sea corals from habitat suitability models is used to answer the first question. Distribution of historical bottom trawl effort is used to answer the second, with estimates of seabed areas swept by bottom trawlers being used to develop discounting factors for reduced biodiversity in previously fished areas. These are used in a quantitative ecological risk assessment approach to guide spatial protection planning to address the third question. The coral VME likelihood (average, discounted, predicted coral habitat suitability) of existing spatial closures implemented by New Zealand within the SPRFMO area is evaluated. Historical catch is used as a measure of cost to industry in a cost : benefit analysis of alternative spatial closure scenarios. Results indicate that current closures within the New Zealand SPRFMO area bottom trawl footprint are suboptimal for protection of VMEs. Examples of alternative trawl closure scenarios are provided to illustrate how the approach could be used to optimise protection of VMEs under chosen management objectives, balancing protection of VMEs against economic loss to commercial fishers from closure of historically fished areas.",2013,,PLOS ONE,8,12,,WOS:000328735700052,10.1371/journal.pone.0082273,,#19929,Penney 2013,,

Simple and clearcut answers on environmental issues require synthesis of the field information using statistics, simulation models and multiple criteria analysis (MCA). Statistics is easy to apply whereas simulation models enable researchers to forecast future trends as well as test different scenarios. MCA allows the co-estimation of socio-economic variables providing a compromise between scientists' and policy makers' priorities.

"Plutonium concentration and Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratio in biota collected from Amchitka Island, Alaska: recent measurements using ICP-SFMS","Bu, KX; Cizdziel, JV; Dasher, D","Three underground nuclear tests, including the Unites States' largest, were conducted on Amchitka Island, Alaska. Monitoring of the radiological environment around the island is challenging because of its remote location. In 2008, the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Legacy Management (LM) became responsible for the long term maintenance and surveillance of the Amchitka site. The first DOE LM environmental survey occurred in 2011 and is part of a cycle of activities that will occur every 5 years. The University of Alaska Fairbanks, a participant in the 2011 study, provided the lichen (Cladonia spp.), freshwater moss (Fontinalis neomexicanus), kelp (Eualaria fistulosa) and horse mussel (Modiolus modiolus) samples from Amchitka Island and Adak Island (a control site). These samples were analyzed for (PU)-P-239 and Pu-240 concentration and Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratio using inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry (ICP-SFMS). Plutonium concentrations and Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratios were generally consistent with previous terrestrial and marine studies in the region. The (230)+Pu-240 levels (mBq kg(-1), dry weight) ranged from 3.79 to 57.1 for lichen, 167-700 for kelp, 27.9-148 for horse mussel, and 560-573 for moss. Lichen from Adak Island had higher Pu concentrations than Amchitka Island, the difference was likely the result of the higher precipitation at Adak compared to Amchitka. The Pu-240/Pu-239 atom ratios were significantly higher in marine samples compared to terrestrial and freshwater samples (t-test, p < 0.001); lichen and moss averaged 0.184 +/- 0.007, similar to the integrated global fallout ratio, whereas kelp and mussel (soft tissue) averaged 0.226 +/- 0.003. These observations provide supporting evidence that a large input of isotopically heavier Pu occurred into the North Pacific Ocean, likely from the Marshall Island high yield nuclear tests, but other potential sources, such as the Kamchatka Peninsula Rybachiy Naval Base and Amchitka Island underground nuclear test site cannot be ruled out.

The target population was composed with students aged 12-16 years schooled in colleges of Sousse in Tunisia. To evaluate the intervention, a sampling was used to include 2200 students who participated to the questionnaire. All the students of intervention group received a standardized program with information about healthy nutrition and physical activity. An Arabic pre-tested and auto-administered questionnaire was used to assess nutrition and physical activity intention and behavior before and after the intervention.Results: The intervention group's posttest knowledge and behavioral intention were significantly higher than the control group's posttest. No significant differences occurred in posttest attitudes between the control and intervention groups. A multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the predictors of students' ""healthy behavior"".Conclusion: This school based intervention improved eating and physical activity intentions and behaviors among schoolchildren. ""Healthy behaviors"" were determined by age, father's profession and home characteristics. This finding could direct future interventions to disadvantaged categories.

Communicating environmental information to the stakeholders in coastal and marine policy-making: Case studies from Nova Scotia and the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy region,"Soomai, SS; MacDonald, BH; Wells, PG","This study examined the awareness of, use by, and influence on stakeholders in coastal and marine policy-making in Eastern Canada and the United States of environmental publications produced by government agencies. Research was conducted in collaboration with government agencies and the publications evaluated were: (1) The 2009 State of Nova Scotia's Coast Report, released by the Government of Nova Scotia: and (2) The State of the Gulf of Maine Report, released by the Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment. Studying the use and influence of such reports is essential to assure accountability for use of public funds and for environmental protection. Interviews and surveys, web analytics, media scans, and citation analysis were conducted shortly after public release of the reports. The views of multiple stakeholders were considered, including policy and decision makers, scientists, industry, and the public. While produced for different audiences and in different formats, the two reports are important sources of baseline information on regional coastal issues. The methods used to promote awareness of the reports targeted the ""interested public"", which included individuals and groups who usually respond to government requests for input, who may be better able to inform policy, and who are already active in coastal zone conservation. Raising awareness and use of information was challenged by the need to communicate environmental information to diverse audiences and to engage the general public (stakeholders and individuals outside of established networks).

Practical tools to support marine spatial planning: A review and some prototype tools,"Stelzenmuller, V; Lee, J; South, A; Foden, J; Rogers, SI","Marine planners use spatial data to assess planning options. They need analytical approaches, methods, applications and practical software tools to enable assessment of the relationships between human uses and ecosystem components. Here the results of a two-stage process, aimed at developing practical and GIS-based tools for direct use by planners, are presented. First, some available tools for use in the early stages of plan development were reviewed; for example, to identify interaction between activities to reduce potential conflicts or assist in zone delineation, methods to facilitate a risk assessment of the cumulative effect of human pressures and tools offering decision support. Second, a stakeholder workshop was organised to identify routine marine planning tasks and the technical tools required to support those tasks. From the 39 practical tools reviewed, mostly published in peer-reviewed literature between 1998 and 2009, the majority have been applied in the marine environment in Europe, USA and Australia. It was observed that many of the tools are designed to be used by scientists, programmers or strategic planners with only a few that could be used by case officers (regulators). Together with the results of the stakeholder workshop a suite of prototype tools were developed that offer utility to marine planners. Thus the developed tools provide a solid basis for future development as they are a result of a transparent and participatory process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Physiological and behavioural outcomes of a randomised controlled trial of a cognitive behavioural lifestyle intervention for overweight and obese adolescents,"Brennan, L; Walkley, J; Wilks, R; Fraser, SF; Greenway, K","Aim: This study evaluates the efficacy of the CHOOSE HEALTH program, a family-based cognitive behavioural lifestyle program targeting improved eating and activity habits, in improving body composition, cardiovascular fitness, eating and activity behaviours in overweight and obese adolescents.Method: The sample comprised 29 male and 34 female overweight (n = 15) or obese (n = 48) adolescents aged 11.5-18.9 years (M = 14.3, SD = 1.9). Participants were randomly allocated to treatment or waitlist control conditions; waitlist condition participants were offered treatment after 6 months. DEXA-derived and anthropometric measures of body composition; laboratory-based cycle ergometer and field-assessed cardiovascular fitness data; objective and self-report physical activity measures; and self-report measures of eating habits and 7-day weighed food diaries were used to assess treatment outcome. Adherence to treatment protocols was high.Results: Treatment resulted in significant (p < .05) and sustained improvements in a range of body composition (body fat, percent body fat, lean mass) and anthropometric measures (weight, BMI, BMI-for-age z-score and percentiles). Minimal improvements were seen in cardiovascular fitness. Similar results were obtained in completer and intention-to-treat analysis. Poor adherence to assessment protocols limits conclusions that can be drawn from physical activity and dietary data.Conclusions: Participation in the CHOOSE HEALTH program resulted in significant improvement in body composition. Longer-term follow up is required to determine the durability of intervention effects. Alternative approaches to the measurement of diet and physical activity may be required for adolescents.

"But are tourists satisfied? Importance-performance analysis of the whale shark tourism industry on Isla Holbox, Mexico","Ziegler, J; Dearden, P; Rollins, R","The objective of this paper is to understand the motivations and satisfactions of whale shark tour participants on Isla Holbox, Mexico in order to assess the success of this industry in meeting customer expectations. Whale shark tour participants were provided with a list of environmental and setting features and asked to rate the importance of, and satisfaction with, each feature. Importance-performance (IP) analysis was used to compare these scores and identify areas of management concern. The IP analysis identified key issues with false advertising, lack of educational information, perceived crowding, and tour cost. These factors are representative of larger issues related to the uncontrolled growth of the whale shark tourism industry on Holbox. Management should focus on limiting the growth of the industry, ensuring the equitable distribution of economic benefits within the industry, and developing and implementing effective guide training and interpretation programs.

Insomnia is associated with impaired quality of life among bariatric surgery candidates,"O'Brien, EM; Dalrymple, K; Hrabosky, J; Chelminski, I; Young, D; Zimmerman, M","Little is known about the prevalence or impact of insomnia symptoms in obese individuals pursuing bariatric surgery. The present study from the Rhode Island Bariatric Surgery (RIBS) project examined insomnia symptoms among 2300 individuals pursuing bariatric surgery. Patients were evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID), Schedule for Affective Disorders (SADS), Rhode Island Bariatric Surgery Interview (RIBSI), and the SF-36 as a measure of quality of life. The presence of insomnia symptoms was determined via ratings for the SCID items assessing initial, middle, and terminal insomnia symptoms, and the SADS insomnia item was used to measure severity of insomnia symptoms. Clinical and demographic variables were obtained from the SCID and self-report measures. Insomnia symptoms were endorsed by 25.8% of participants. Bariatric patients with insomnia symptoms were rated as having a more severe clinical presentation and lower functioning, and were more likely to have a history of psychiatric treatment and/or hospitalization, compared to bariatric patients without insomnia. Linear regression analyses demonstrated that insomnia severity was a significant predictor for scores on each of the 8 SF-36 subscales after accounting for age, gender, race, education level, BMI, depression severity, and sleep apnea. Additionally, a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) controlling for depression severity and sleep apnea demonstrated significantly poorer scores on 6 of the 8 SF-36 subscales for bariatric patients with current insomnia symptoms. Results revealed that insomnia symptoms are common among bariatric patients and are associated with reduced quality of life and poorer current functioning. This suggests that insomnia symptoms are an important clinical target in bariatric patients prior to surgery. (C) 2011 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A set of criteria, derived from collaborative planning theory, is employed to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. The advisory council meets some criteria for effective stakeholder participation but is found to be lacking in key elements, including shared purpose and interdependency.

A review of environment problems in the coastal sea of South China,"Han, QY; Huang, XP; Xing, QG; Shi, P","The coastal sea of South China provided an important habitat for protection and propagation of marine organisms. Rapid economic development and human activities, such as wastewater discharge, reclamation, overfishing and aquaculture in the South China Sea had already resulted in environmental degradation, and thus caused sharp contradictions between exploitation and protection of the coastal sea of South China. In this present article, the main environment problems and degradation trends were reviewed based on literatures and other sources of information, which mainly referenced nutrient pollution, persistent organic pollution and metal pollution, decrease of biodiversity, reduction of marine habitat and frequent natural and ecological disasters. The current efforts in China on protecting the environment in the coastal sea of South China were discussed, which included improving legislation by formulating a series of laws and regulations at national or local level, setting up natural reserves, and supporting research projects. There were many challenges regarding policy, management and science research to protect and sustain the coastal sea of South China, such as imperfect legal and administrative systems, lack of public participation, poor financial support and lack of monitoring and evaluation. Finally, some recommendations were put forward for the sake of the sustainable use of the environment in the coastal sea of South China, including reinforcing the planning of marine resource exploitation and use through integrated coastal zone management, strengthening the marine environment and protection awareness of the public, and scientifically establishing the fishery spawning spots and aquatic reserves.",2012,,AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT,15,2,108-117,WOS:000306323300002,10.1080/14634988.2012.687611,,#19942,Han 2012,,
"Dysmetabolic signals in ""metabolically healthy"" obesity","Manu, P; Ionescu-Tirgoviste, C; Tsang, J; Napolitano, BA; Lesser, ML; Correll, CU","Background: Obesity is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity, atherogenic dyslipidemia and hypertension, but clinical studies have also identified a ""metabolically healthy"" obese phenotype.Objective: To compare the characteristics of so-called ""metabolically healthy"" obese (MHO), normal weight subjects (MHNW) and obese with insulin resistance in the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2004 (NHANES).Design, setting and participants: Insulin resistance was defined by a homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) value in the upper tertile for the entire NHANES cohort. ""Metabolic health"" was defined as the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and lipid-lowering therapy. The study evaluated the 314 MHO, 1173 MHNW and 843 insulin-resistant obese from among the 6485 non-diabetic, non-pregnant adults aged 20-79 years.Main outcome measures: Demographic, metabolic, nutrition and physical activity features.Results: MHO and MHNW groups were similar regarding age, and fasting glucose and triglyceride levels. MHO had higher insulin (P < 0.0001), insulin resistance as measured with the homeostatic model (P < 0.0001), non-HDL cholesterol (P = 0.002 in females and P = 0.049 in males) and C-reactive protein levels (P < 0.0001 in females and P = 0.038 in males), and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels (P < 0.002). In addition, MHO females had higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (P = 0.012) and systolic blood pressure (P = 0.02), and lower intake of dietary fiber (P = 0.0009) and levels of physical activity (P = 0.002).

In the context of a validation campaign for the SMOS mission, intensive airborne and in situ observations were performed in southwestern France for the SMOS CAL/VAL, from April to May 2009 and from April to July 2010. The CAROLS (Cooperative Airborne Radiometer for Ocean and Land Studies) bi-angular (34 degrees-0 degrees) and dual-polarized (V and H) L-band radiometer was designed, built and installed on board the French ATR-42 research aircraft. During springs of 2009 and 2010, soil moisture observations from the SMOSMANIA (Soil Moisture Observing System-Meteorological Automatic Network Integrated Application) network of Meteo-France were complemented by airborne observations of the CAROLS L-band radiometer, following an Atlantic-Mediterranean transect in southwestern France. Additionally to the 12 stations of the SMOSMANIA soil moisture network, in situ measurements were collected in three specific sites within an area representative of a SMOS pixel. Microwave radiometer observations, acquired over southwestern France by the CAROLS instrument were analyzed in order to assess their sensitivity to surface soil moisture (w(g)). A combination of microwave brightness temperature (T(b)) at either two polarizations or two contrasting incidence angles was used to retrieve w(g) through regressed empirical logarithmic equations with good results, depending on the chosen configuration. The regressions derived from the CAROLS measurements were applied to the SMOS T(b) and their retrieval performance was evaluated. The retrievals of w(g) showed significant correlation (p-value < 0.05) with surface measurements for most of the SMOSMANIA stations (8 of 12 stations) and with additional field measurements at two specific sites, also.

"Toothfish crises, actor diversity and the emergence of compliance mechanisms in the Southern Ocean","Osterblom, H; Sumaila, UR","Illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing is a challenging form of non-compliance in many marine ecosystems. IUU fishing has attracted substantial political attention in the Southern Ocean, where a series of crises created windows of opportunity for change. A crises-response framework was used for examining these dynamics between 1995 and 2009. Crises were defined in relation to their perceived threat, decision time and surprise. Published material was combined with the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLRs) expert interviews, to evaluate changing perceptions of IUU fishing and corresponding actions. A first crisis led to an increased use of informal shortcuts and a concentration of power. A second crisis created windows of opportunities for policy entrepreneurs and stimulated policy innovation. A third crisis led to the implementation of existing contingency plans. These responses were consistent with predictions from the crisis-response framework used. The series of crises threatened the credibility of CCAMLR and changed the incentives for engaging in coalitions, which led to the development of both management and enforcement approaches to compliance. State and non-state actors became increasingly involved in developing these diverse compliance mechanisms, thereby actively contributing to the adaptive capacity of CCAMLR. Synergies between fisheries industry, environmental conservation, and state sovereignty interests were effectively utilized. Individual actors, organizations and countries providing leadership had strong incentives for doing so. Trust and reputation was important for the compliance mechanisms leading to a substantial reduction of IUU fishing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Reorienting Systematic Conservation Assessment for Effective Conservation Planning,"Sewall, BJ; Freestone, AL; Moutui, MFE; Toilibou, N; Said, I; Toumani, SM; Attoumane, D; Iboura, CM","Systematic conservation assessment (an information-gathering and prioritization process used to select the spatial foci of conservation initiatives) is often considered vital to conservation-planning efforts, yet published assessments have rarely resulted in conservation action. Conservation assessments may lead more directly to effective conservation action if they are reoriented to inform conservation decisions. Toward this goal, we evaluated the relative priority for conservation of 7 sites proposed for the first forest reserves in the Union of the Comoros, an area with high levels of endemism and rapidly changing land uses in the western Indian Ocean. Through the analysis of 30 indicator variables measured at forest sites and nearby villages, we assessed 3 prioritization criteria at each site: conservation value, threat to loss of biological diversity from human activity, and feasibility of reserve establishment. Our results indicated 2 sites, Yimere and Hassera-Ndrenge, were priorities for conservation action. Our approach also informed the development of an implementation strategy and enabled an evaluation of previously unexplored relations among prioritization criteria. Our experience suggests that steps taken to ensure the closer involvement of practitioners, include a broader range of social data, encourage stakeholder participation, and consider the feasibility of conservation action can improve the relevance of assessments for conservation planning, strengthen the scientific basis for conservation decisions, and result in a more realistic evaluation of conservation alternatives.",2011,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,25,4,688-696,WOS:000292907500005,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01697.x,,#19946,Sewall 2011,,
Eliciting cognitive processes underlying patterns of human-wildlife interactions for agent-based modelling,"Chion, C; Lamontagne, P; Turgeon, S; Parrott, L; Landry, JA; Marceau, DJ; Martins, CCA; Michaud, R; Menard, N; Cantin, G; Dionne, S","Integrating humans in our perception of ecosystems is of critical importance to adequately protect natural resources. This poses the challenge of understanding human decision making in the context of decisions potentially threatening nature's integrity. We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model that simulates commercial whale-watching vessel movements based on a representation of the captains' decision making process when observing marine mammals in and around the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park in Quebec, Canada. We focus here on the human part of the global model, the submodel of whale movements having been developed and validated independently (Lamontagne, 2009). The objective of this study is to select and validate a model of whale-watching captains' decision making using the pattern-oriented modelling approach (POM): three models of cognitive heuristics (satisficing, tallying and Take The Best) along with a null model (random choice) were tested. These concurrent decision making models were built upon knowledge extracted from data collected during field investigations, including interviews with whale-watching captains and park wardens, onboard and shore-based observations, and analyses of a multi-year dataset of sampled whale-watching excursions. Model selection is performed by statistically comparing simulated and real patterns of boat trajectories (excursion length), spatial hotspots (kernel home range 50%), and excursion content (species observed, time allocated to different activities). The selection process revealed that the Take The Best heuristic was the best performing model. We used the distribution of the number of whale-watching boats in the vicinity (2000 m) of each vessel as a secondary pattern to validate the ability of each decision making model to reproduce real observations. Given the prevalence of the species attribute in the choice of which whale to observe, the Take The Best heuristic's ability to deal with non-compensatory information partly explains its overall best performance. Moreover, implementation of communication abilities between modelled captains led to the emergence of persistent observation sites in the park, which is a well-known collective spatiotemporal characteristic of the whale-watching industry; thus validating the fundamental assumption that cooperation is an important mechanism behind the pattern of whale-watching boat dynamics. The relatively good performance of the satisficing and tallying heuristics supports both field evidence and literature on bounded rationality in that humans likely use collections of heuristics (adaptive toolbox) to solve decision problems in different contexts. The POM strategy appears suitable to build up an informative ABM regarding the management of human activities in a natural environment so that further developments will be assessed following the same approach.

"Ichthyofauna monitoring using higher taxa in Cabo Pulmo National Park, Mexico","Saldivar-Lucio, R; Reyes-Bonilla, H","Ichthyofauna monitoring using higher taxa in Cabo Pulmo National Park, Mexico. The uses of biological indicators allow to save time, resources and staff efforts when monitoring programs are conducted. The reef fishes are among the species with biggest potential as indicators since they are conspicuous, easy to identify in the field and have ecological and economical importance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of higher taxa to predict fish ecological indices in Cabo Pulmo reef. We generated multiple step-wise regression equations with species abundance data grouped at genera and family levels as factors, and using ecological indices (H', J', Delta*) as dependent variables. To test the efficiency of the models, the expected indexes were compared with those observed in the field during independent test surveys. Results showed that all models were highly significant, and the best fit occurred at genus level to H', while those used for Delta*, based on family data level, were less precise. The proportion of variables required to apply prediction models of any ecological index never exceeded 41% of the total taxa (genera or families). In conclusion, the use of regression methods to determine higher taxa indicators is adequate and represents a good potential to be used in monitoring programs. In addition, the use of genera and families as indicators provide logistic benefits as training for monitors is less intense and expensive. Finally, the use of expected-observed comparisons to measure the quality of the evaluations can be useful for managers in order to interpret and communicate results of the scientific endeavors to the society, so they in turn can participate and help to improve and facilitate",2011,,REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,59,2,871-885,WOS:000291835900026,,,#19948,Saldivar-Lucio 2011,,
"Relationships between body fat accumulation, aerobic capacity and insulin resistance in Japanese participants","Yoshimura, E; Kumahara, H; Tobina, T; Ayabe, M; Matono, S; Anzai, K; Higaki, Y; Kiyonaga, A; Tanaka, H","Aim: This study evaluated the relationships between body fat accumulation, aerobic capacity and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in 61 Japanese participants.Method: The participants were middle-aged to elderly (age: 33-73; BMI: 21.6-38.5). Body fat mass (FM) was evaluated by hydrostatic weighing. Computed tomography was used to evaluate visceral and subcutaneous fat areas (VFA and SFA), liver to spleen ratio (L/S), and low-density muscle area (LDMA). To assess aerobic capacity, VO2 at the lactate threshold (VO2@LT) and VO2 (peak) were measured using a bicycle ergometer.Results: FM, VFA, SFA, LDMA and L/S significantly correlated with HOMA-IR, but VO2@LT and VO2 (peak) did not. Analysis of covariance after adjustment for VFA or other body fat distribution and aerobic capacity showed that HOMA-IR had a significant linear trend across the tertile groups of L/S. However, for FM, VFA, SFA, LDMA and VO2@LT or VO2 (peak), no significant trend was observed between the tertiles and insulin resistance.Conclusions: Ectopic fat deposition in the liver may influence insulin resistance independently of other body fat accumulation and aerobic capacity in Japanese participants.

"The human impact on natural rock reserves using basalt, anorthosite, and carbonates as raw materials in insulation products","Dahl, TW; Clausen, AU; Hansen, PB","Typical crustal rocks such as basalt, limestone, and anorthosite are used in stone wool insulation products. The raw materials for stone wool production are not specific to any rare mineral source but depend upon the mixture of materials having the correct chemical composition, exemplified by 40 wt% basalt, 20 wt% anorthosite, and 40 wt% cement-bonded renewable materials. This study provides an overview of the natural cycle of these resources, including their abundances in nature, and sets the consumption by the stone wool industry and other human activities in perspective. Basalt, anorthosite, and carbonates are widespread on all continents. Although basaltic rocks cover most of the ocean floor, these reserves are hidden below several kilometres of water and therefore are regarded as inaccessible. Instead, large igneous provinces on land constitute major basaltic reserves useful for human rock exploration. Globally, anorthositic provinces comprise smaller volumes than do limestone or basalt, but still occur in sufficient amounts to supply for the production of insulation materials indefinitely. An evaluation of the modern consumption rates and reserves shows that the crustal inventories of these rock types are so large that they could supply current human demand for millions of years. The natural degradation of surface rocks occurs by physical and chemical weathering creating sediment that is transported along rivers and deposited in the ocean. Sediments are either obducted with continental lithosphere or subducted with oceanic crust and recycled through the mantle by plate tectonics. Insulation products have a chemical composition similar to average crustal rocks and participate in the natural rock cycle. However, these products need not accumulate in nature, inasmuch as old insulation materials serve as excellent source materials for new products. Moreover, current production lines exploit more than 30 natural and 20-30 synthetic source materials that circumvent regional depletion and contribute to the recycling of other industrial materials.",2011,,INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW,53,8,894-904,WOS:000289246300002,10.1080/00206810903233058,,#19950,Dahl 2011,,
Protecting Marine Parks and Sanctuaries from Aquatic Nuisance Species Releases from Ballast During Emergency Response Events,"Green, PA","Commercial shipping activities that release aquatic invasive species are recognized globally as a dominant transport vector for marine invasions. Aquatic nuisance species (ANS) introductions have resulted in billions of dollars of damages and immeasurable biological devastation within the Great Lakes. National Park Service managers are working with United States Geological Survey scientists to develop and refine emergency response options for ballast from high risk ships. This is to aid Parks in reducing risk from high risk ships either during an emergency response or when de-ballasting as part of ship operations within Park waters. The National Park Service is working on developing a salvors' guide to provide guidelines for emergency treatment of ballast within Park waters if conditions require ballast discharge. Discharges of live non-native species are currently prohibited within U.S. National Park boundaries, but permanent treatment of ballast to comply with this regulation may be as far off as 2021. Having potential tools to treat ballast on a short term basis will allow ship owners/operators to comply with mandatory regulations within Park boundaries or to participate voluntarily. In addition, accidental groundings make it imperative that procedures are developed to (1) assess whether the ballast is high risk, and (2) ensure management as part of an emergency incident in a timely way. This paper will present a review of a prototype draft risk assessment, methods previously used to treat ballast, and a summary of future work designed to address this critical need.

Changes in thoracolumbar kinematics and centre of pressure when performing stationary tasks in moving environments,"Duncan, CA; MacKinnon, SN; Albert, WJ","Wave induced platform motions observed in marine environments pose a significant risk to offshore workers' safety. While the strenuous and potentially dangerous nature of the many offshore occupations does play a role, the wave induced platform motions observed in marine environments and their effects on postural stability also contribute to this risk. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of platform motions on thoracolumbar kinematics and foot centre of pressures during stationary standing and load holding tasks. Twelve participants (9 male, 3 female) completed two tasks in four distinct sea conditions. While performing these tasks, thoracolumbar kinematics and foot centre of pressures were measured using the Lumbar Motion Monitor and F-Scan foot pressure system, respectively. Thoracolumbar kinematics and foot centre of pressures measurements increased in magnitude as platform motion magnitudes increased. Furthermore, in tasks where the subject experienced a motion induced interruption dependent measurement magnitudes further increased. Results suggest that wave induced perturbations have a significant effect on biomechanical measures used to assess balance and stability during the performance of stationary standing and load holding activities. These measures suggest that the body is less stable while performing standing and holding tasks in moving environment, particularly as a change-in-support corrective strategy must be initiated regularly to maintain postural stability.

Each stage of the approach is controlled by a Graphical User Interface which allows a team of non-expert modellers to compare the outcomes of multiple model simulations and to decide what further simulation is needed.A distinguishing feature of the method is that it allows the goal of the management strategies to arise as a result of the interaction between the user and the model, rather than being defined a priori, as well as to change during the process in response to the information and the insight such modelling may provide. We envisage that a management team, rather than a single user, may also employ the method as an avenue for communication, in order to discuss the potentially conflicting aspects of different model outcomes along the path to finding workable compromises. We discuss an application of the approach to the sustainable management of a recreational fishery in a marine park in Western Australia. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Characteristics of metabolic syndrome and its clinical components among diabetic Vietnamese patients: A survry at two institutions in Ho Chi Minh City,"Yokokawa, H; Goto, A; Khue, NT; Nam, TQ; Trung, TT; Khoa, VT; Nguyen, TBN; Minh, PN; Vinh, NQ; Okayama, A; Yasumura, S","Objective: The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among Vietnamese diabetic patients and to investigate their characteristics.Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 652 outpatients who were recruited from one public general hospital (People Hospital 115) and one private clinic (Medic Center) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We obtained informed consent from participants, collected clinical information from medical files, and conducted patient interviews. We evaluated the collected information descriptively and diagnosed metabolic syndrome according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Worldwide Definition of the Metabolic Syndrome.Results: A total of 517 eligible patients (175 men and 342 women) were analyzed. Mean age was 54.6 years for men and 60.7 years for women. Metabolic syndrome was observed in 39.4% of men and 70.5% of women. Central obesity was more prevalent among women (72.5%) compared to men (39.4%). Participants with metabolic syndrome were less likely to endorse a sense of general well-being, and women with metabolic syndrome were likely to have less diabetes-related distress.Conclusions: this study revealed a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome in diabetic Vietnamese patients, especially among women, and revealed central obesity as a key feature. A prospective study should be conducted in this population in order to assess impacts of metabolic syndrome on disease outcome. (C) 2010 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.

Stakeholder consultation during the planning phase of scientific programs,"Human, BA; Davies, A","Stakeholder consultation is being adopted as standard practice in the planning and management of natural resource management programs. While the utility of stakeholder participation has been investigated for the evaluation and implementation phases of natural resource management programs, few studies have examined the utility of stakeholder consultation during the initial phases of developing such programs. This paper presents a case study from a project developing a marine and coastal monitoring program for the Pilbara and Kimberley region of northern Western Australia. Via a series of workshops held in the region, stakeholders were asked to prioritise future research needs using several voting procedures. During the analyses of the results from the different voting procedures, it became apparent that there were high levels of inconsistency, poor correlation, and contradiction, between participants' responses. Despite the rigour of the selection process used to identify 'suitable' stakeholders for the workshops, these results show that stakeholders did not have the technical or broader contextual knowledge about marine ecosystems to effectively and objectively contribute to the research prioritisation and planning process. Based on the outcomes of this study, we argue that project designers need to be clear about why they are involving stakeholders in a project, particularly in light of the costs involved (financial, time, resources, costs to the stakeholder) in stakeholder consultation. stakeholder involvement may be appropriate in later stages of developing natural resource management programs (implementation and management), however, stakeholder involvement is not appropriate in the initial phases of such programs, where scientific expertise is essential in formulating scientific concepts and frameworks.

THE SPATIAL DIMENSIONS OF FISHERIES: PUTTING IT ALL IN PLACE,"Lorenzen, K; Steneck, RS; Warner, RR; Parma, AM; Coleman, FC; Leber, KM","Explicit consideration of space and place in fisheries science and governance holds great promise for addressing management failures caused by inappropriately defined boundaries, disregard for spatial dynamics in assessments, and incompatible ocean uses. Most importantly, it can foster the emergence of sustainable, rights-based governance regimes and protected areas to aid conservation and restoration of marine ecosystems. The proceedings of the 2008 Mote Symposium in Fisheries Ecology review and synthesize recent progress in spatial fisheries science as a basis for effective space- and place-based governance. Ecological, social, and governance systems operate at multiple, nested scales. Identification of these scales and fostering of multiscale linkages and feedback loops is a key challenge in spatial governance. Spatial management measures provide opportunities for effective regulation and conservation at low transaction costs. They also provide new opportunities as well as challenges for fisheries assessment. Effective implementation of spatial governance benefits from participatory planning involving all legitimate stakeholders and responsive, adaptive, learning approaches.",2010,,BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE,86,2,169-177,WOS:000278021900003,,,#19958,Lorenzen 2010,,
Show me the way: Inclination towards governance attributes in the artisanal fisheries of Sierra Leone,"Baio, A","A decentralised artisanal fisheries resource stewardship framework brings the decision-making process closer to users, obliging the downward transfer of stewardship power sharing and incorporating local stakeholder input in assessing outstanding needs. Local councils were instrumental in implementing this strategy in Sierra Leone and their dissolution in 1972 impacted negatively on local participation. Their reintroduction in 2004 was rushed, and desired outcomes are yet to be realised. The relative importance of stakeholders in the artisanal fisheries of Sierra Leone and that of governance attributes have been evaluated using the Analytical Hierarchy Process methodology under two scenarios (the current stewardship arrangement and a theoretical reformed system). The objective of the study is to elicit stakeholder's opinions on stewardship arrangement in order to evaluate attributes which may aid (or deter) governance thereby creating a baseline against which changes from governance reform can be measured. Results indicate that the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources currently wields disproportionate power over the stewardship of fisheries resources scoring the highest normalised geometric mean of 43% compared to about 20% reported for the University of Sierra Leone. The Ministry of Local Government scored 13.5% but all other stakeholders scored less than 10%. The Ministry of Fisheries saw a drop in its rating to about 24% under a reformed system whilst the Ministry of Local Government increased in stature to 17% as the University of Sierra Leone remained unchanged. Endowment attribute was the most dominant at 72% under the current system, but political and institutional attributes were more important with about 40 and 31% respectively under the reformed scenario (compared to 17% for endowment attribute). A receptive Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources sharing power and responsibility in a reformed system is sought. The communities perceive equity in the political and institutional governance attributes as the means of achieving equity in the endowment and economic attributes as the end. Reforms could only succeed in the spirit of the ministry's quest to effectively implement the fisheries policy by empowering and facilitating institutions best suited to carry out stewardship functions at the local level.

Ring test for whole-sediment toxicity assay with -a- benthic marine diatom,"Araujo, CVM; Tornero, V; Lubian, LM; Blasco, J; van Bergeijk, SA; Canavate, P; Cid, A; Franco, D; Prado, R; Bartual, A; Lopez, MG; Ribeiro, R; Moreira-Santos, M; Torreblanca, A; Jurado, B; Moreno-Garrido, I","This work presents the results of an interlaboratory proficiency exercise for whole-sediment toxicity assays with the benthic marine diatom Cylindrotheca closterium. An assay protocol was established and followed by all participating laboratories. Cell growth after 72 h exposure was the endpoint used. Four sediment samples of unknown toxicity were assayed. The main problem encountered during this exercise was the differences in the cell growth of algae exposed to reference sediment. Those differences may be associated with changes in the physiological status of the initial culture due to temperature changes during transport to the other laboratories. In general, the method proposed presented good replicability (precision between replicates) and reproducibility (interlaboratory precision). Around 80% (17 out of 21) of results obtained were classified as satisfactory (Z-scores <2). The whole-sediment assay with C closterium presented here can be considered sufficiently successful for possible use as a standard toxicity test. The assay is simple to perform, the proposed species is ecologically relevant as an integral component of microphytobenthos, and is widely distributed around the world. These positive factors suggest that the whole-sediment assay with the benthic marine diatom C. closterium can be used as a reliable tool in marine sediment quality assessment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Health benefits of a 4-month group-based diet and lifestyle modification program for individuals with metabolic syndrome,"Pettman, TL; Buckley, JD; Misan, GMH; Coates, AM; Howe, PRC","Background: Individualised highly prescriptive lifestyle programs for obesity management tend to be limited by resource constraints and difficulty with uptake. Aim: To evaluate the health benefits of a minimally prescriptive group-based lifestyle intervention in participants with the metabolic syndrome (MetS).Methods: 153 obese adults with MetS were randomised to intervention (INT) or control (CON) for 16 weeks. INT was provided with education, practical strategies and group-based support to achieve diet and physical activity (PA) modifications based on Australian national guidelines. Anthropometric, cardio-metabolic, physical fitness and diet assessments were undertaken at baseline and 16 weeks.Results: Compared with CON, INT demonstrated greater improvements in weight, BMI, body fat mass and percent, abdominal fat mass (AbdoFat) and waist circumference; systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure; total cholesterol and tow-density lipoprotein cholesterol; physical work capacity (PWC) and handgrip strength (p < 0.01, group x time for all). Energy intake and % energy from saturated fat (%Sfat) decreased in both groups (p < 0.05 for time). Dietary glycemic index (GI) decreased more in INT (p < 0.01, group x time). Reductions in weight, waist and AbdoFat were associated with reductions in %Sfat (r = 0.379, 0.306, 0.319, respectively; p < 0.01) and GI (r = 0.308, 0.411, 0.296, respectively; p < 0.01). Reductions in AbdoFat were inversely related to increased PWC (r = -0.385; p < 0.001). Withdrawals were similar in INT (6%) and CON (14%) (p = 0.48).Conclusions: A group-based minimally prescriptive lifestyle modification program with a high retention rate achieved significant improvements in body composition, physical and cardio-metabolic fitness. Group-based programs may provide an achievable and effective, but less resource intensive, method for obesity and MetS management than individualised approaches.

The structure and evolution of the coastal migrant fishery of Kenya,"Fulanda, B; Munga, C; Ohtomi, J; Osore, M; Mugo, R; Hossain, MY","The current study was carried out over a period of one year to characterise the coastal migrant fishery of Kenya. The study looked at gears and vessels used, and ownership, demographic factors including ages of the fishers and family sizes, migrant activity and resource conservation at two main fishing villages in Kenya: Vanga and Mayungu in the south and north coasts, straddling at 4.663 degrees S and 39.215 degrees E and 3.214 degrees S and 40.135 degrees E respectively. Further, the fishers were categorised with regard to fishing, gear and vessel operation and trade, and evolution upon entry into the fishery was also assessed in order to define fisher-stake in the fishery for resource management and conservation planning. Structured questionnaires were used to interview the fishers, and data and information recorded from 1018 fishers during the survey. Migrants accounted for over 63% of the fishers in the two study sites, with majority of the fishers lying in the 15-45 year age bracket. Dependence level averages at 4-6 person families per fisher. Entry to the fishery was mainly at seamen level, progressing to fishermen and finally to fish dealers (tajiris), with the latter holding >62% capital in the fishery. Resource management in the fishery was low and only similar to 10% of the fishers were active participants in marine conservation and community beach management issues. Fisher migrations were mainly monsoon season-linked (>58%) although social factors such as family location determined to a great extent the expanse of the migrations. The revival of fisheries cooperatives and active participation in community resource management and conservation groups is envisaged as the key to the sustainability of both the marine resources and the economies associated with this high mobility, cross-border fishery.

Collaboration versus communication: The Department of Energy's Amchitka Island and the Aleut Community,"Burger, J; Gochfeld, M; Pletnikoff, K","Increasingly managers and scientists are recognizing that solving environmental problems requires the inclusion of a wide range of disciplines, governmental agencies, Native American tribes, and other stakeholders. Usually such inclusion involves communication at the problem-formulation phase, and at the end to report findings. This paper examines participatory research, the differences between the traditional stakeholder involvement method of communication (often one-way, at the beginning and the end), compared to full collaboration, where parties are actively involved in the scientific process. Using the Department of Energy's (DOE) Amchitka Island in the Aleutians as a case study, we demonstrate that the inclusion of Aleut people throughout the process resulted in science that was relevant not only to the agency's needs and to the interested and affected parties, but that led to a solution. Amchitka Island was the site of three underground nuclear tests from 1965 to 1971, and virtually no testing of radionuclide levels in biota, subsistence foods, or commercial fish was conducted after the 1970s. When DOE announced plans to close Amchitka, terminating its managerial responsibility, without any further testing of radionuclide levels in biota, there was considerable controversy, which resulted in the development of a Science Plan to assess the potential risks to the marine environment from the tests. The Consortium for Risk Evaluation with Stakeholder Participation (CRESP) was the principle entity that developed and executed the science plan. Unlike traditional science, CRESP embarked on a process to include the Alaskan Natives of the Aleutian Islands (Aleuts), relevant state and federal agencies, and other stakeholders at every phase. Aleuts were included in the problem-formulation, research design refinement, the research, analysis of data, dissemination of research findings, and public communication. This led to agreement with the results, and to developing a path forward (production of a biomonitoring plan designed to provide early warning of any future radionuclide leakage and ecosystem/human health risks). The process outlined was successful in resolving a previously contentious situation by inclusion and collaboration with the Aleuts, among others, and could be usefully applied elsewhere to complex environmental problems where severe data gaps exist.

EMSO: European multidisciplinary seafloor observatory,"Favali, P; Beranzoli, L","EMSO has been identified by the ESFRI Report 2006 as one of the Research Infrastructures that European members and associated states are asked to develop in the next decades. It will be based on a European-scale network of multidisciplinary seafloor observatories from the Arctic to the Black Sea with the aim of long-term real-time monitoring of processes related to geosphere/biosphere/hydrosphere interactions. EMSO will enhance our understanding of processes, providing long time series data for the different phenomenon scales which constitute the new frontier for Study of Earth interior, deep-sea biology and chemistry, and ocean processes. The development of an underwater network is based on past EU Projects and is supported by several EU initiatives, such as the on-going ESONET-NoE, aimed at strengthening the ocean observatories' Scientific and technological Community. The EMSO development relies on the synergy between the scientific community and industry to improve European competitiveness with respect to Countries Such as USA, Canada and Japan. Within the FP7 Programme launched in 2006, a call for Preparatory Phase (PP) was issued in order to support the foundation of the legal and organisational entity in charge of building Lip and managing the infrastructure, and coordinating the financial effort among the countries.

Calibration and validation of these PP models are not straightforward, however, and comparative studies show large differences between model estimates. The goal of this paper is to compare PP estimates obtained from 30 different models (21 SatPPMs and 9 BOGCMs) to a tropical Pacific PP database consisting of similar to 1000 C-14 measurements spanning more than a decade (1983-1996). Primary findings include: skill varied significantly between models, but performance was not a function of model complexity or type (i.e. SatPPM vs. BOGCM); nearly all models underestimated the observed variance of PR specifically yielding too few low PP (< 0.2 g Cm-2 d(-1)) values; more than half of the total root-mean-squared model-data differences associated with the satellite-based PP models might be accounted for by uncertainties in the input variables and/or the PP data; and the tropical Pacific database captures a broad scale shift from low biomassnormalized productivity in the 1980s to higher biomass-normalized productivity in the 1990s, which was not successfully captured by any of the models. This latter result suggests that interdecadal and global changes will be a significant challenge for both SatPPMs and BOGCMs. Finally, average root-mean-squared differences between in situ PP data on the equator at 140 degrees W and PP estimates from the satellite-based productivity models were 58% lower than analogous values computed in a previous PP model comparison 6 years ago. The success of these types of comparison exercises is illustrated by the continual modification and improvement of the participating models and the resulting increase in model skill.

Protection measures implemented by New Zealand for vulnerable marine ecosystems in the South Pacific Ocean,"Penney, AJ; Parker, SJ; Brown, JH","Interim measures for bottom fisheries adopted by the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization (SPRFMO) require participants to limit bottom fishing to currently fished areas and prevent significant adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs). The New Zealand bottom trawl footprint consists of two hundred 20 min latitude x 20 min longitude blocks trawled over the period 2002-2006 within which New Zealand flagged vessels reported 11 425 tows, primarily targeting orange roughy Hoplostethus atlanticus. Past effort and seabed impact levels differ substantially between these blocks, ranging from lightly (<3 tows block(-1)) to heavily trawled (>50 tows block(-1)), with a maximum of 1417 tows in the most heavily trawled block. Effort data were used to stratify the bottom trawl footprint into 3 effort tiers as the basis for a management approach tailored to levels of past impact: (1) adequate and representative spatial closure of areas likely to support VMEs, with emphasis on less impacted areas; (2) a move-on rule in areas where likelihood of encounter with a VME is unknown; and (3) constraining fishing effort to remaining open areas most impacted by past fishing, Sixty-two lightly trawled blocks were closed to prevent impact in these areas; 69 moderately trawled blocks were subjected to a move-on rule; and 69 heavily trawled blocks were designated as open to fishing. A further 20 blocks were closed to provide representative protection within the moderately and heavily trawled tiers. In the absence of seabed biodiversity data, biologically important physical factors, primarily depth range and topography, were used to select interim precautionary closures and to evaluate representativity Of closed in comparison with open areas.

Weight reduction and maintenance in a specialized outpatient health care center,"Giel, KE; Binkele, M; Becker, S; Stubler, P; Zipfel, S; Enck, P","Objective: To prospectively evaluate the amount of weight loss and subsequent maintenance and to identify correlates of successful weight reduction in overweight and obese outpatients treated in a specialized health care center.Treatment: A treatment program involving diet, exercise and behavior modification was provided in an outpatient setting. Twenty-four treatment courses with a total of 177 participants (age: 45.5 +/- 12.2 year; BMI: 36.7 +/- 5.6 kg/m(2)) were run.Measurements: Weight and baseline characteristics were recorded at start of program; weight was re-assessed at the end of treatment and 1 year after the end of treatment.Results: Patients achieved a significant weight toss of 5.6 +/- 7.9 kg (5.1 +/- 6.4% of initial body weight) in the course of 1 year. An average of 80.8% or 4.8 kg of initial weight loss was maintained a year after treatment, representing a significant weight regain. A higher initial BMI, intake of venlafaxin, a higher percentage of course attendance, course completion and hypertension were associated with greater weight loss. The interaction of the specific treatment course and the percentage of attendance explained 25% of the variance of percental total weight toss.Conclusion: Significant weight losses can be achieved by overweight and obese patients after a treatment program in specialized health care addressing diet, exercise and behavioral aspects. Weight loss maintenance remains difficult for patients. The specific treatment group itself and attendance of course sessions are critical for weight loss and should be considered in the design and evaluation of group-based treatment programs.(c) 2008 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity, Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The laboratories were able to determine total HBCD concentrations in the marine samples with satisfying quality (RSD < 35%). However, the analysis of samples with low HBCD contamination (< about 2 ng g (- 1) lipid weight) should be improved.

Microcosm experiments of oil degradation by microbial mats. II. The changes in microbial species,"Lliros, M; Gaju, N; de Oteyza, TG; Grimalt, JO; Esteve, I; Martinez-Alonso, M","The influence of microbial mats on the degradation of two crude oils (Casablanca and Maya) and the effect of oil pollution on the mat structure were assessed using model ecosystems, prepared under laboratory conditions subject to tidal movements, from pristine Ebro Delta microbial-mat ecosystems. Both selected oils are examples of those currently used for commercial purposes. Casablanca crude oil is aliphatic with a low viscosity; Maya represents a sulphur-rich heavy crude oil that is predominantly aromatic. In the unpolluted microcosms, Microcoleus chthonoplastes-, Phormidium- and Oscillatoria-like were the dominant filamentous cyanobacterial morphotypes, whilst Synechoccocus-, Synechocystis- and Gloeocapsa-like were the most abundant unicellular cyanobacteria. After oil contamination, no significant changes of chlorophyll a and protein concentrations were observed, though cyanobacterial diversity shifts were monitored. Among filamentous cyanobacteria, M. chthonoplastes-like morphotype was the most resistant for both oils, unlike the other cyanobacteria, which tolerated Casablanca but not Maya. Unicellular cyanobacteria seemed to be resistant to pollution with both essayed oils, with the exception of the morphotype resembling Gloeocapsa, which was sensitive to both oils. The crude-oil addition also had a significant effect on certain components of the heterotrophic microbial community. Casablanca oil induced an increase in anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria, whereas the opposite effect was observed in those heterotrophs when polluted with Maya oil. The overall results, microbiological and crude-oil transformation analysis, indicate that the indigenous community has a considerable potential to degrade oil components by means of the metabolic cooperation of phototrophic and heterotrophic populations.

Planning for sustainable tourism in southern Pulau Banggi: An assessment of biophysical conditions and their implications for future tourism development,"Teh, L; Cabanban, AS","A priori assessments of a site's biophysical and socio-economic capacity for accommodating tourism are less common than tourism impact studies. A priori evaluations can provide a contextual understanding of ecological, economic and socio-cultural forces, which shape the prospects for sustainable tourism development at the host destination, and can avert adverse impacts of tourism. We conduct an a priori assessment of the biophysical environment of Pulau Banggi, in the Malaysian state of Sabah for sustainable tourism development. We characterise baseline conditions of the island's marine biodiversity, seasonality, and infrastructure. We then evaluate how existing biophysical conditions will influence options for sustainable tourism development. In particular, we suggest conditions, if there are any, which constitute a limit to future tourism development in terms of compatibility for recreation and resilience to visitor impacts. We find that the biggest constraint is the lack of adequate water and sanitation infrastructure. Blast fishing, although occurring less than once per hour, can potentially destroy the major attraction for tourists. We conclude that while Pulau Banggi possesses natural qualities that are attractive for ecotourism, financial and institutional support must be made available to provide facilities and services that will enable local participation in environmental protection and enhance prospects for future sustainable tourism.

Current status of coastal zone issues and management in China: A review,"Cao, WZ; Wong, MH","This paper identifies and examines social-economic and environmental issues recently emerged in China's coastal zone. Evaluation of management scheme and progress in perspectives of coordinated legislation, institutional arrangement, public participation, capacity building, and scientific research (mainly coastal planning and functional zoning) in China's coastal zone are made. The Chinese government has made a significant effort in developing legislation for the, coastal zone. Jurisdictional and zoning boundaries, and allocating use rights for coastal and marine resources have been established. State Oceanic Administration is the leading agency responsible for China's ocean policyrnaking and overall management of ocean and coastal affairs. A demonstrated project for integrated coastal management in Xiamen has been implemented, and is characterized as ""decentralization"" approach in decision-making process. In view of the above, comprehensive coastal management in China is a big challenge, facing with many difficulties.

"Traditional and modern Greenlandic food - Dietary composition, nutrients and contaminants","Deutch, B; Dyerberg, J; Pedersen, HS; Aschlund, E; Hansen, JC","Objectives: High levels of n-3 fatty acids and other nutrients in traditional Inuit food appear to provide some protection against the typical diseases of affluent industrialized societies: cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. An increased intake of imported food among Inuits will probably increase their frequency of these diseases. However, since the 1970s it has become evident that the marine-based Inuit diet also contains high levels of potentially toxic lipophilic organic pollutants and heavy metals. Since these two food related opposing health effects appear to be inseparable, the phenomenon has been known as ""The Arctic Dilemma"". However, both the fatty acid composition and the contaminant levels vary in Greenlandic food items. Thus in principle it is possible to compose a diet where the benefits and risks are better balanced. Our objectives of this study were to compare traditional and modem meals in Greenland concerning the dietary composition, nutrients, and health indicators among the consumers.Study design: The present study was a cross-sectional dietary survey as part of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment, Human Health Programme (AMAP). These results were compared with older dietary surveys in Greenland.Methods: Dietary components, fatty acids, and nutrients in 90 local meals collected by duplicate portion method in Uummarmaq town, north Greenland 2004 and in Narsaq, south Greenland 2006, were compared with 177 duplicate meals sampled in the village of Igdslorsuit, Uummannaq, district, 1976 and also compared with other dietary studies in Greenland 1953-1987. Anthropometric measures (weight, height, and body mass index, BMI) and blood lipids were measured as health indicators among the participants.Results: Between the traditional foods sampled or analysed 30-50 years ago and the modem food from 2004 to 2006, significant differences were found in the dietary composition. The percentage of local food had decreased, to a present average of about 20% and with it the dietary content of n-3 fatty acids. Also, the intakes of many vitamins and minerals had decreased, and were below Nordic Nutrient Recommendations in 2004 and 2006. Vitamin A, B-1, (B-2), B-12, iron, iodine, phosphorus, and selenium contents were correlated with n-3 content, whereas vitamin C, folate, and calcium contents were not and the same time very low. In the traditional food, especially from the villages, the intakes of vitamin A, vitamin D, and iron were extremely high and borderline toxic. The levels of contaminants such as organochlorins and heavy metals were also strongly correlated with the relative content of local food in the diet. The best balance between potentially beneficial and harmful substances was found for 20-30% local food, corresponding to a daily intake of 3-5 g of n-3 fatty acids.Body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), cholesterol, and S-triglycerides had increased significantly between 1976 and 2004.Conclusion: The dietary changes to a more western fare were found to be negative resulting in less adequate nutrient coverage but at the same time lower contaminant load. Thus, we recommend not to increase the consumption of local products beyond the present level but rather to improve the quality of the imported food. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"Using chemometrics to evaluate anthropogenic effects in Daya Bay, China","Wu, ML; Wang, YS","In this work, we have monitored 12 stations to study the effects caused by natural, marine and anthropogenic activities on water quality in Daya Bay, China. Results show that the N:P ratios are 71.54, 41.29, 81.50 and 98.27 in winter, spring, summer and autumn, respectively. Compared with the data of the past 20 years, the atomic N:P ratios have increased, indicating increased potential for P limitation; the atomic Si:N ratios have decreased; the nutrient structure has substantially changed over a period of 20 years. These findings show that the nutrient structure may be related to anthropogenic influence. The data matrix has been built according to the results, which were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). This analysis extracted the first four principal components (PC), explaining 73.58% of the total variance of the raw data. PC1 (25.53% of the variance) is associated with temperature, salinity and nitrate. PC2 (21.64% of the variance) is characterized by dissolved oxygen and silicate. PC3 (15.91% of the variance) participates mainly by nitrite (NO2-N) and ammonia (NH4-N). PC4 explaining 10.50% of the variance is mainly contributed by parameters of organic pollution (dissolved oxygen, 5-day biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand).PCA has found the important factors that can describe the natural, marine and anthropogenic influences. Temperature and salinity are important indicators of natural and marine characters in this bay. The northeast monsoons from October to April and southwest monsoons from May to September have important effects on the waters in Daya Bay. It has been demonstrated that anthropogenic activities have significant influence on nitrogen form character. In spatial pattern, a marine aquaculture area and a non-aquaculture area are widely identified by the scores of stations. In seasonal pattern, dry and wet season characters have been demonstrated.

"Fisher knowledge as expert system: A case from the longline fishery of Grenada, the Eastern Caribbean","Grant, S; Berkes, F","We investigated a fisher knowledge generation process in the longline fishery for large pelagic fish in Gouyave, Grenada, using techniques of participant observation, interviews, and focus group discussion. We identified nine categories of knowledge that are important for finding and catching large pelagic fish: seasons, use of bait, gear technology, weather conditions, fishing practice, fish habits and behaviour, fish movement, 'folk oceanography' (seabirds, seawater colour, current), and fish stomach contents. Conceptualized as a decision-making rule structure, this information can be analyzed as an expert system, the rationale being to understand how human experts (fishers) use technological and ecological knowledge. We extract heuristic rules (expressed as IF-THEN clauses) based on fishers' description of how they make decision on how, where, and when to find and catch fish. Gouyave fishers are adaptive experts because they have the ability to learn from and deal with new situations. They rely on observation, experimentation, and experience through the feedback of fish catches and evaluation, learning adaptively to improve their understanding of the marine ecosystem and the resource.

Contribution of the NASA Land-Cover/Land-Use Change Program to the Northern Eurasia Earth Science Partnership Initiative: An overview,"Gutman, G","The Northern Eurasia Earth Science Partnership Initiative (NEESPI) is a rapidly growing program that involves national government agencies, academia and private organizations in the U.S., Europe, Japan and Northern Eurasia. During the last decade the Northern Eurasian region have been undergoing socioeconomic, climatic and demographic changes. The causes of these changes, the associated interactions between the land surface, the atmosphere and the surrounding ocean and the resultant impact on the sustainability of land use of the region are important topics for scientific research. The NEESPI Science Plan has been prepared as an integrated regional study to better understand these hemispheric-scale interactions, to evaluate the combined role of climate and anthropogenic impacts on the Northern Eurasia ecosystems, and to assess how future human actions would affect the global climate and ecosystems of the region. Projections of the consequence of global changes on the regional environment, the economy and the quality of life in Northern Eurasia that is of primary importance to the nations in the region is an additional focus of this initiative. The NASA Land-Cover/Land-Use Change (LCLUC) Program has supported NEESPI since its inception, and currently funds 26 NEESPI projects. Several other NASA programs are also currently supporting or planning to support the NEESPI. The NEESPI program links to the major international programs under the Earth System Science Partnership (IGBP, IHDP, DIVERSITAS and WCRP) and under the Global Terrestrial Observing System, such as the Global Observation of Forest Cover/Global Observation of Landcover Dynamics (GOFC/GOLD). A number of the NEESPI science activities are aligned with the Global Earth System of Systems (GEOSS) objectives, giving an emphasis to societal benefits, so that the NEESPI framework can serve as a regional test bed for international cooperation in developing a system of observational systems. Since it is a new program, most of the NEESPI research projects have just started. Therefore, rather than describing these projects this paper focuses on presenting some results of the longer term projects which are being continued under NEESPI, and on the expected products from the program and its future directions.

Effects of moving environments on the physical demands of heavy materials handling operators,"Matthews, JD; MacKinnon, SN; Albert, WJ; Holmes, M; Patterson, A","Introduction: Commercial fishing, cargo and passenger shipping, as well as offshore oil and gas production are essential industrial activities in Canada. as well as other parts of the world. Mariners have to concentrate on maintaining balance as well as be prepared for motion-induced interruptions while performing work-related tasks, such as lifting. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a moving platform and load stability on recruitment of selected trunk musculature and thoraco-lumbar kinematics during common lifting tasks.Methods: Nineteen healthy male participants (22.78 +/- 1.72 years, 1.81 +/- .06 m, 82.42 +/- 12.08 kg) were recruited. Loads and conditions were manipulated to determine the effects of instability during manual materials handling tasks. Participants lifted four different loads (10 kg stable, 10 kg unstable, 15 kg stable, 15 kg unstable) onto a shelf in one lab condition and three different ship conditions (roll, quartering seas, and pitch) while wearing EMG electrodes and a Lumbar Motion Monitor (LMM). A repeated measures ANOVA was used to test for significant differences between loads and conditions for both electromyography (EMG) and LMM data.Results: The mean and maximum EMG (% Maximal Voluntary Contraction) showed significant differences across loads for all muscles except the left latissimus dorsi but showed a significant difference across conditions for the left latissimus dorsi only. For all loads, the pitch condition produced the largest maximum sagittal thoraco-lumbar velocities and the lab condition produced the smallest. There were significant mean and maximum thoraco-lumbar velocity differences across conditions in all three planes.Conclusion: The pitch condition proved to be the most difficult condition to maintain stability regardless of whether or not a load was being handled. Motion direction of a platform, occurring during a lifting task, did not significantly increase muscular activity about the selected trunk musculature but did increase significantly thoraco-lumbar kinematics. Lifting unstable loads, compared to stable loads, in movina environments did significantly increase muscular activity about the selected trunk musculature but did not significantly increase thoraco-lumbar kinematics.Relevance to industryRisk management in maritime industries assumes tremendous importance as accidents at sea can result in personnel injury or death and environmental catastrophe. While much is known about the risks of manual materials handling in stable locations, little has been documented about the additive effects of working in motion rich environments. These results demonstrate that load and motion characteristics have specific effects upon operator performance and provide guidance for workstation design and administrative controls for lifting tasks on seagoing vessels.

"Dietary composition and contaminants in north Greenland, in the 1970s and 2004","Deutch, B; Dyerberg, J; Pedersen, HS; Asmund, G; Moller, P; Hansen, JC","Objectives: The fatty acid composition and other nutrients in traditional Inuit food appear to provide some protection against diseases of affluent industrialized societies, such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. A transition towards increased amounts of imported food might increase the occurrence of these diseases among Inuit.

Our objective was to compare traditional and modem meals in Greenland regarding dietary composition, content of n-3 fatty acids and contaminants.Study design: The present study was part of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme, AMAP, comparing the results of dietary composition and nutrients in 177 traditional meals collected in Uummannaq municipality, north Greenland in 1976 with 90 meals sampled in Uummannaq town in 2004 under similar conditions. Eleven pesticides, 14 PCB congeners, heavy metals, selenium, and fatty acids were analysed in meals and blood samples from the participants. Contaminant levels were compared between 1976 and 2004 after adjustment for n-3 fatty acids, indicating local food content.Results: Between the traditional meals collected 30 years ago and the meals from 2004, dramatic and significant changes have occurred in the dietary composition. The percentage of local food has decreased, and with it the intake of n-3 fatty acids.Calculated as daily intake, all but three contaminants had decreased significantly. However, this could be explained by the lower intake of local food. After adjustment for n - 3 fatty acid content in the food, significant declines of concentration in the local food were evident only for PCBs and lead, whereas for mercury, DDTs, and chlordanes the levels were unchanged, and for hexachlorobenzene, mirex, and toxaphenes, the levels had increased significantly.Conclusion: The consumption of locally produced food has decreased in Greenland during the last 30 years and this has led to a reduction in the daily intake of contaminants. However, the concentrations of contaminants in local food items have not decreased, except for PCB and Lead. Therefore, we recommend that the consumption of local products is not increased beyond the present level, until the level of contaminants is reduced to a safer level. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Influence of particle and surface quality on the vitrinite reflectance of dispersed organic matter: Comparative exercise using data from the qualifying system for reflectance analysis working group of ICCP,"Borrego, AG; Araujo, C; Balke, A; Cardott, B; Cook, AC; David, P; Flores, D; Hamor-Vido, M; Hiltmann, W; Kalkreuth, W; Koch, J; Kommeren, CJ; Kus, J; Ligouis, B; Marques, M; Mendonca, JG; Misz, M; Oliveira, L; Pickel, W; Reimer, K; Ranasinghe, P; Suarez-Ruiz, I; Vieth, A","The development of a qualifying system for reflectance analysis has been the scope of a working group within the International Committee for Coal and Organic Petrology (ICCP) since 1999, when J. Koch presented a system to qualify vitrinite particles according to their size, proximity to bright components and homogeneity of the surface. After some years of work aimed at improving the classification system using photomicrographs, it was decided to run a round robin exercise on microscopy samples. The classification system tested consists of three qualifiers ranging from excellent to low quality vitrinites with an additional option for unsuitable vitrinites. This paper reports on the results obtained by 22 analysts who were asked to measure random reflectance readings on vitrinite particles assigning to each reading a qualifier. Four samples containing different organic matter types and a variety of vitrinite occurrences have been analysed. Results indicated that the reflectance of particles classified as excellent, good or poor compared to the total average reflectance did not show trends to be systematically lower or higher for the four samples analysed. The differences in reflectance between the qualifiers for any given sample were lower than the scatter of vitrinite reflectance among participants. Overall, satisfactory results were obtained in determining the reflectance of vitrinite in the four samples analysed. This was so for samples having abundant and easy to identify vitrinites (higher plant-derived organic matter) as well as for samples with scarce and difficult to identify particles (samples with dominant marine-derived organic matter). The highest discrepancies were found for the organic-rich oil shales where the selection of the vitrinite population to measure proved to be particularly difficult. Special instructions should be provided for the analysis of this sort of samples. The certainty of identification of the vitrinite associated with the vitrinite reflectance values reported has been assessed through a reliability index which takes into account the number of readings and the coefficient of variation. The same statistical approach as that followed in the ICCP vitrinite reflectance accreditation program for single seam coals has been used for data evaluation. The results indicated low to medium dispersion for 17 out of 22 participants. This, combined with data from other sets of comparative analyses over a long period, is considered an encouraging result for the establishment of an accreditation program on vitrinite reflectance measurements in dispersed organic matter.

"Durability of concrete structures: DURACON, an iberoamerican project. Preliminary results","Duracon Collaboration; de Rincon, OT","This work presents preliminary results of the international project: ""Effect of the environment on reinforced concrete durability: DURACON"", which shows the physical, mechanical and chemical characterization of two different concrete mixtures prepared in the participating countries, as well as the environment to which the specimens are exposed. These results show the potentiality and probability of future reinforcement corrosion, depending on the type of mixture and the environment to which the structure is exposed. To that effect, concrete specimens, with and without reinforcement, were prepared for electrochemical and physical/mechanical/chemical testing using the existing materials in each participating country, following premises that enabled the preparation of similar concrete specimens. Two water/cement ratios (0.45 and 0.65) were selected, where the concrete with w/c = 3 0.45 had to have a minimum cement content of 400 kg m(-3) and the other with w/c = 0.65, a minimum compressive strength of 21 MPa. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), crushed coarse aggregate, and silica sand were used for concrete preparation. The specimens were exposed to several microenvironments including urban and marine conditions (at least two testing sites in each country), resulting into a total of 46 test sites distributed among 11 countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Spain, Uruguay, Portugal, and Venezuela). The environment was evaluated using ISO Standard 9223 and the concrete was characterized by measuring compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, total and effective porosity, and rapid chloride permeability according to ASTM standards, as well as resistance to water absorption, using the Fagerlund method.After 1-year exposure, some results of the corrosion potentiality and probability analysis of the reinforcement in several test sites based on environmental meteorochemical parameters show that, for specific microclimates like those in marine atmospheres, the most aggressive environment is that at Cabo Raso test site in Portugal, inducing the greater steel-corrosion probability. The least aggressive is the one at Valparaiso in Chile. It was also determined that Maracaibo, Venezuela, is the one that has the greatest probability of early rebar corrosion initiation by carbonation, with the test site at Cali, Colombia being the one that would induce the least corrosion probability.

"A randomized, controlled field trial for the prevention of jellyfish stings with a topical sting inhibitor","Boulware, DR","Background. Jellyfish stings are a common occurrence among ocean goers worldwide with an estimated 150 million envenomations annually. Fatalities and hospitalizations occur annually, particularly in the Indo-Pacific regions. Anew topical jellyfish sting inhibitor based on the mucous coating of the clown fish prevents 85% of jellyfish stings in laboratory settings. The field effectiveness is unknown. The objective is to evaluate the field efficacy of the jellyfish sting inhibitor, Safe Sea (TM).Methods. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial occurred at the Dry Tortugas National Park, FL, USA and Sapodilla Cayes, Belize. Participants were healthy volunteers planning to snorkel for 30 to 45 minutes. Ten minutes prior to swimming, each participant was directly observed applying a blinded sample of Safe Sea (Nidaria Technology Ltd, Jordan Valley, Israel) to one side of their body and a blinded sample of Coppertone (R) (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) to the contralateral side as placebo control. Masked 26 g samples of both Safe Sea SPF15 and Coppertone (R) SPF15 were provided in identical containers to achieve 2 mg/cm(2) coverage. Sides were randomly chosen by participants. The incidence of jellyfish stings was the main outcome measure. This was assessed by participant interview and examination as subjects exited the water.Results. A total of 82 observed water exposures occurred. Thirteen jellyfish stings occurred during the study period for a 16% incidence. Eleven jellyfish stings occurred with placebo, two with the sting inhibitor, resulting in a relative risk reduction of 82% (95% confidence interval: 21%-96%; p = 0.02).

Past and future fisheries modeling approaches in the Philippines,"Lachica-Alino, L; Wolff, M; David, LT","Philippines coastal fisheries research started during the colonization period in the 1800s with the basic taxonomic identification of the countries aquatic resources and a description of their distribution in national waters. Research further evolved with the change from localized fisheries governance to a centralized one, presently, with a combination of both. The dramatic postwar expansion of Philippine fisheries in the mid 1940s led to the need for sustainable resources management. In the mid-1970s, single-species fisheries approaches (i.e. specifically surplus production models) indicated the overfished state of the Philippine coastal fisheries resources. These early models together with additional ecological and socioeconomic studies, served as inputs to coastal resources management initiatives, in the context of an ecosystem approach. The implementation of further management schemes such as marine reserves and fish sanctuaries also resulted from these initiatives. The decentralization of governance of coastal resources in the 1990s led to participatory or co-management approaches for the local governance of coastal resources. The development and great improvement of ecosystem-based models in fisheries science (such as Ecopath with Ecosim [EwE]) during this period allowed for investigations into the interactions of the multispecies and multigear fisheries dynamics. Complementary models derived from single-species such as Yield per Recruit and Surplus production in conjunction with ecosystem-based (EwE-type) approaches are both needed in Philippine fisheries research. An emerging framework for sustainable Philippine fisheries management system requires mainstreaming of coastal governance with science based adaptive management for Philippine aquatic resources governance.",2006,,REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES,16,2,201-212,WOS:000240536600005,10.1007/s11160-006-9008-8,,#19985,Lachica-Alino 2006,,
"Risk perception bias, self-reporting of illness, and the validity of reported results in an epidemiologic study of recreational water associated illnesses","Fleisher, JM; Kay, D","Epidermiologic Studies of water associated illness often have to rely on self-reported symptoms of the outcome illness(es) under study. Individual participant's perception of risk, in theory, can affect the validity of self-reported symptoms. The magnitude and effect of possible ""risk perception bias"" was evaluated as part of a series of randomized trials designed to assess infectious disease transmission via exposure to marine recreational waters with modest sewage contamination. All study subjects were blinded to both their individual indices of exposure and the outcome illnesses under study. Of the five outcome illnesses Studied, the effect of ""risk perception bias"" only effected one: skin ailments. Although analysis of crude rates of skin ailments showed the exposed group (bathers) to be 3.5 times more likely to report skin ailments relative to the non-exposed (non-bathers), when the data was stratified by any perceived health risk of bathing in such waters, this association was shown to be Spurious in nature. Bathers having pre-conceived notions of any health risk due to the exposure were 10.63 times more likely to report skin ailments relative to the unexposed (non-bathers) (95% CI 2.36 - 47.8, P = 0.0002), while bathers without any pre-conceived notion of risk were no more likely to report skin ailments relative to non-bathers (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.11 - 3.24, P = 0.71). Further stratification by exposure grouping showed bathers with pre-conceived notions of excess risk to be 4.78 times more likely to report skin ailments relative to bathers without any notion of excess risk (95% CI 1.04 - 21.86, P = 0.03), while among non-bathers those with pre-conceived notions of risk were 3.70 times less likely to report skin ailments relative to non-bathers without any pre-conceived notion of risk (95% CI 0.70 - 19.60, P = 0.10).

A Coastal and Marine National Park for Scotland in partnership with Integrated Coastal Zone Management,"Stead, SM; McGlashan, DJ","Potential benefits and constraints of a Coastal and Marine National Park (CMNP) for the entire Scottish coastline have yet to be fully debated. This paper recommends using Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) as a process to develop a CMNP. Converting the principles of ICZM into practice Could be strengthened using the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000. This Act provides the Scottish Executive with an existing legal mechanism to set up the UK's first CMNP.Issues highlighted that would benefit from further investigation include ways to effectively harness expertise, funding considerations, practical implementation and stakeholder participation. A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats analysis demonstrates a 'quick and dirty' method to help assess whether CMNPs are a viable option for managing Scotland's coastal areas. Strengthening the existing local coastal fora network in partnership with universities that have 'in-house' multi-disciplinary expertise is put forward as one way to implement a CMNP.Stakeholder engagement at the start and throughout the debate on CMNPs warrants a high priority for action. Incentives that help to counter against survey fatigue and actively sustain involvement of civil society and key sectors should be sought from local knowledge. This approach could also address the fundamental gap in translating stakeholder derived information into practical policy recommendations that are more widely supported. Finally, local knowledge can aid resource management plans on a local, national and international scale and be applied to testing management scenarios. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Inter-annual variability in the thermal structure of an oceanic time series station off Ecuador (1990-2003) associated with El Nino events,"Garces-Vargas, J; Schneider, W; del Rio, RA; Martinez, R; Zambrano, E","Previously unpublished data (1990-2003) from a marine station located 20 km off the coast of Ecuador (Station La Libertad, 02 degrees 12'S, 080 degrees 55'W) are employed to investigate oceanic inter-annual variability in the far eastern equatorial Pacific, and its relation to the central-eastern equatorial Pacific. La Libertad is the only time series station between the Galapagos Islands and the South American coast, the region most affected by El Nino events (El Nino 2 region, 0-5 degrees S, 90 degrees W-80 degrees W). Although configured and serviced differently, station La Libertad can be looked at as an eastern extension of the TAO/TRITON monitoring system, whose easternmost mooring is located at 95 W, 1550 km offshore. This study of El Nino's impact on the thermocline and its relationship to sea surface temperature revealed anomalies in the thermocline at station La Libertad some 2-4 months before their appearance at the sea surface. Inter-annual variability, namely quasi-biennial and quasi-quadrennial oscillations, accounts for roughly 80% of the total variance in temperature anomalies observed in the water column at station La Libertad.The coincidence in both phase and amplitude of these inter-annual oscillations explains the strength of El Nino events in the water column off La Libertad. We further show that anomalies in heat content appear 8-9 weeks earlier at 140 W in the equatorial Pacific (6550 km away from the coast) than at the coast itself. The arrival of El Nino, which has important regional social consequences as well as those for local fisheries, could therefore be predicted in the subsurface waters off Ecuador by using these anomalies as a complementary index. In addition, the speed of the eastward propagation of these El Nino-associated anomalies' suggests the possible participation of higher-order baroclinic mode Kelvin waves and associated interaction processes in the eastern Pacific, which should be further investigated.

Coastal aquifers as important natural hydrogeological structures,"Custodio, E","Coastal aquifers share many hydrogeological characteristics with continental aquifers. The main difference is the risk of water quality deterioration by salinity increase. This is due not only to natural or induced mixing with present sea water but also to the possible existence of old marine water in deep aquifers and aquitards, and to the generation of saline waters and brines in flat areas at an elevation close to that of current sea level. The mixing of freshwater with 3-4 per cent of sea water is enough to make the freshwater unfit for most uses and may seriously reduce its environmental role. The principles governing the distribution of fresh and saline water bodies in the ground and the mixing mechanisms are reasonably well known, although their evaluation and monitoring require networks and methods of study that are often more complex and costly than those commonly used in continental aquifers. Currently it is possible to devise coastal aquifer exploitation plans to limit and correct salinization problems by applying technological methods as well as institutional management with the effective participation of stakeholders. Coastal aquifers are highly valuable as a freshwater resource and as a regulating, emergency and strategic water reserve, since they occur in the lower reaches of river basins. These areas are often flat, with little opportunity to store surface water, and often where population, economic activity and tourism concentrate. The widely diffused 'hydromyth' that developing a coastal aquifer necessarily means salinization problems is false in most cases. Improved knowledge, case studies and social communication are needed to counter this fallacy and to beneficially use opportunities that are technically, economically and socially of high value.",2005,,GROUNDWATER AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,6,,15-38,WOS:000241224800003,,,#19990,Custodio 2005,,
Integrated ocean management and the collaborative planning process: the Eastern Scotian Shelf Integrated Management (ESSIM) Initiative,"Rutherford, RJ; Herbert, GJ; Coffen-Smout, SS","In its capacity to lead and facilitate the development and implementation of integrated management plans under the 1997 Oceans Act, Fisheries and Oceans Canada is working with a range of stakeholders through a collaborative process-the Eastern Scotian Shelf Integrated Management (ESSIM) Initiative-to develop and implement an integrated ocean management plan for the eastern Scotian Shelf off Nova Scotia. Stakeholders include federal and provincial departments, aboriginal communities, municipal and local planning authorities, ocean industry and resource use sectors, coastal communities, environmental interest groups, and university researchers. This large ocean management area possesses important living and non-living marine resources, high biological productivity and diversity, and increasing levels of multiple use and competition for ocean space and resources. The ESSIM vision is to achieve environmental, economic, social/community, and institutional sustainability in the eastern Scotian Shelf.The ESSIM Initiative is building a collaborative planning process that involves all interested and affected parties. Ongoing information sharing and dialogue with stakeholder groups is providing capacity building and important input to current proposals for a collaborative planning structure and the ocean management plan. A joint federal-provincial working group has been established to move the Initiative forward within government and to address policy and regulatory coordination for ocean management. The future ocean management plan will include a balanced set of environmental, social, economic and institutional objectives, indicators and management strategies, as well as spatial and temporal planning approaches to address multiple ocean use.This article provides an overview of the ESSIM Initiative, including an assessment of ocean use, ecosystem understanding, and ocean management and planning requirements. The design of a collaborative management and planning structure and process will be discussed, as well as the key elements of the future integrated ocean management plan. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"Fishing cooperatives' participation in managing nearshore resources: the case in Capiz, central Philippines","Baticados, DB","This study documents the resource management initiatives undertaken by fishing cooperatives in Capiz, central Philippines and examines the conditions and the socioeconomic determinants that persuade members to assume responsibility for managing nearshore resources. The results show that in the absence of formal resource management schemes, cooperative members adopt self-management strategies to protect their resource base only if the sustainability of their livelihood is seriously threatened. There is no impediment to female cooperative members (62%) participating in resource management. The factors that positively influenced members' participation were the number of children, perceived fishery conditions, awareness of mangrove conservation and rehabilitation, and assessment of enforcement of the ban on dynamite and cyanide fishing. Fishing cooperatives, however, fail as a source of information on regulation and conservation education of members. But if they were to under-take more education and training programs on nearshore management, cooperatives may become an effective social force in changing the present fisheries management system.

The coastal module of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS): an assessment of current capabilities to detect change,"Malone, TC","Two related topics are addressed in this paper. The first is the challenging and difficult task of producing scientifically credible quantitative assessments of the status, condition or health of coastal marine and estuarine ecosystems on regional to global scales. The second is the current capacity to provide the data required to produce such assessments in a routine and repeatable fashion, a purpose of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS).

The Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve,"Roper, T; Nelson, JG; Day, JC","The Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve (TRNERR) is a 2,500-acre nature preserve located at the southwestern-most corner of the United States, next to the U.S.-Mexico border. A twelve-member board-representing state, federal, and local agencies as wen as academic and nonprofit sector interests-manages the reserve. The major agencies are the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and California State Parks. It is one of twenty-five national estuarine research reserves under NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. TRNERR, is an island of natural habitat and green spaces surrounded by the vast metropolitan region of San Diego-Tijuana. It is of special interest because of the ecological and social services it offers to this large urban region. TRNERR represents some of the last remaining habitat of its type in California, where 90 percent of historical coastal wetlands have been lost to development and other factors. TRNERR is located at the terminus of a 1,750-square mile watershed, of which 70 percent is located in Mexico and the remainder in the United States. Over 370 different bird species have been sighted at the reserve, of which seven are endangered. A variety of projects and associated challenges take place at TRNERR, including restoration and education, cooperative endeavors with Mexican partners, water quality monitoring, local public outreach and education, and diverse research activities.River National Estuarine Reserve can be seen as an integral part of an emerging network of estuarine conservation areas along the increasingly urban southwest California coast; a network that sets an example for similar regions elsewhere in North America. As part of this initiative, a civic society is operating a center to educate a large number of school children and adults about the remaining diversity of biophysical resources in the estuary. More than 140 bird species were recorded there since 1993 and an additional thirty species were reported previously that might still visit the area from time-to-time. Similarly, San Diego has invested heavily in the creation of urban wetlands that support a diverse population of coastal birds and other wildlife (City of San Diego 2001).",2003,,PROTECTED AREAS AND THE REGIONAL PLANNING IMPERATIVE IN NORTH AMERICA,7,,193-204,WOS:000189195000012,,,#19996,Roper 2003,,
Understanding the biogeography of chemosynthetic ecosystems,"Tyler, PA; German, CR; Ramirez-Llodra, E; Van Dover, CL","ChEss is a recently-funded Census of marine life programme aimed at improving our knowledge of the biogeography of deepwater chemosynthetically driven ecosystems by promoting an international field phase of discovery and exploration. The main objectives are to assess and explain the diversity, distribution and abundance of hydrothermal vent and cold seep species. With the global mid-ocean ridge system extending similar to65000 km, it is unlikely that its entire length would be examined in detail. The ChEss programme proposes to select a limited number of target areas chosen for the discovery of new vents and seeps. The intention is to identify the maximum scientific return that could be achieved from detailed investigation of the minimum number of sites at key locations. To narrow the field for exploration, a number of starting hypotheses and goals have been identified. A bio- and geo-referenced database for hydrothermal vent and cold seep species will be created. This database will be integrated with the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS). An international scientific committee will coordinate the programme, facilitate collaboration between participants, promote ship-time applications at national level and stimulate scientific innovation from a wider community.

The uptake of applied ecology,"Ormerod, SJ; Barlow, ND; Marshall, EJP; Kerby, G","1. We asked 229 authors who have published recently in the Journal of Applied Ecology (1999-2001) whether their papers made management or policy recommendations and whether they had evidence of consequent uptake.2. A total of 108 respondents working in the UK (34%). Europe (30%), the Americas (12%), Australasia (11%), Asia (7%) and Africa (6%) reported on I 10 papers. They represented agro-ecosystems (35%), temperate forests or woodlands (16%), savanna, grass or arid lands (11%), rivers or wetlands (10%), estuaries or marine systems (7%) and tropical forests (5%). The major organisms were invertebrates (27%), birds (24%), mammals (21%) and higher plants (21%). Topics apparently under-represented in recent coverage include ecosystem science, urban areas, soils, mountain systems, fish, amphibians and lower organisms such as algae.3. Almost all papers (99%) carried recommendations and for 57% there was evidence of uptake in the broad categories of 'environmental management or models', 'information, training and education' and 'monitoring and assessment'. Most uptake involved large geographical scales through habitat or species management plans (32% of cases), effects on reserve design or designation (6%), and effects on agri-environmental policy (5%). The development of further research (11%), the communication of methods to other ecologists (9%), the dissemination of recommendations to practitioners or agencies (7%), and uptake in training or education (5%) were important uses of information.4. Prestige from publication in the Journal of Applied Ecology, aided several authors in convincing end-users of research value. User involvement in research as participants or funders was widespread (>42% of papers), a fact which almost certainly promotes uptake along with the parallel dissemination of management messages. We view applied issues as an important interface between end-users and ecologists of value to 'both' communities but suggest that improved communication will further benefit the sponsorship and application of ecological science.5. The major reason offered for lack of uptake was that it was still too soon after publication (21% of respondents). Costs, difficulty of implementation, the scale of the problem. and 'challenges to existing thinking' each figured in more than one response.6. For some respondents, papers were led by curiosity rather than the need for direct application.

"Use of thermal and vegetation index data from earth observing satellites to evaluate the risk of schistosomiasis in Bahia, Brazil","Bavia, ME; Malone, JB; Hale, L; Dantas, A; Marroni, L; Reis, R","A geographic information system (GIS) was constructed using maps of regional agroclimatic features. vegetation indices and earth surface temperature data from environmental satellites, together with Schistosoma mansoni prevalence records from 270 municipalities including snail host distributions in Bahia, Brazil to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of infection and to identify environmental factors that influence the distribution of schistosomiasis. In an initial analysis, population density and duration (months) of the annual dry period were shown to be important determinants of disease. In cooperation with the National Institute of Spatial Research in Brazil (INPE), day and night imagery data covering the state of Bahia were selected at approximately bimonthly intervals in 1994 (six day-night pairs) from the data archives of the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) sensor of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-11 satellite. A composite mosaic of these images was created to produce maps of: (1) average values between 0 and + 1 of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); and (2) average diurnal temperature differences (dT) on a scale of values between 0 and 15 degreesC. For each municipality. NDVI and dr were calculated for a 3 x 3 pixel (9 km(2) area) grid and analyzed for relationships to prevalence of schistosomiasis. Results showed a statistically significant relationship of prevalence to dT(rho = - 0.218) and NDVI (rho = 0.384) at the 95% level of confidence by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Results support use of NDVI, dT; dry period climatic stress factors and human population density for development of a GIS environmental risk assessment model for schistosomiasis in Brazil.

Cooperative versus non-cooperative management of shared linefish stocks in South Africa: an assessment of alternative management strategies for geelbek (Atractoscion aequidens),"Hutton, T; Griffiths, MH; Sumaila, UR; Pitcher, TJ","The South African boat-based linefishery is a multi-species fishery with participants broadly divided into commercial (approximately 3000 vessels) and recreational (at least 4000 vessels) components. Atractoscion aequidens is an important species which, owing to a migratory lifestyle, is targeted by commercial communities throughout its estimated 2000 km distribution along the eastern seaboard of southern Africa. The national government is responsible for the management of South Africa's marine resources; in the case of the linefishery this is effort-based, with limits on minimum size, daily bags, the number of commercial permits and to some extent operational area. Results from an age-structured model reveal that the South African geelbek stock is heavily depleted, and that long term biological sustainability would require an increase in the current minimum size limit and/or a daily bag limit for commercial fishers. Compliance with regulations and thus cooperation with the responsible management authority is also essential. Cooperative versus non-cooperative management of the South African A. aequidens stock is explored using game theoretic bio-economic modelling, which simulates the effects of alternative size limits and effort restrictions on two separate jurisdictions that compete for this common-pool resource. The large number of players (licensees) within the linefishery creates a costly situation in terms of facilitating cooperative management, in spite of the potential greater long term social and economic benefits that such management arrangements can yield. The distribution of the different life-history stages of geelbek among competing interests on the east coast of South Africa exacerbates the problem of facilitating cooperative management, because the short term private economic benefits of non-cooperation exceeds the long term overall economic benefits from cooperative management.

User perceptions on coastal resource state and management options in Curacao,"Debrot, AO; Nagelkerken, I","Public environmental awareness and support for management measures are key determinants of the scope for successful implementation of natural resource management. To assess user perceptions and opinions on resource state and potential management options for the coastal zone of Curapao, we queried 250 coastal resource users from around the island (sport divers, part-time artisanal fishermen and recreational boaters) using questionnaires. There is wide awareness of a long-term decline in coastal resource condition as measured by various indicators. Even among fishermen there was wide awareness of anthropogenic contributors to the decline, broad agreement of management measures required and a general willingness to contribute to management by means of annual license fees. Some of the more salient findings include the endorsement by fishermen of the current ban on spearfishing (81%), the regulation of the beach seine fishery for scad (77%), the introduction of fish reserves (72%, special protection for sea turtles (90%), conch (82%), and lobsters (72%), and notable support for gradual elimination of trap fisheries (45%). Also, both divers (65%) and boaters (92%) expressed the importance to them of an attractive coastline, with both groups expressing preference for natural (un-built) coastline (>74%) above other categories. Management based on the concept ""user pays"", as already implemented in the Netherlands Antilles on Saba and Bonaire, is well supported by the resource user public.

"Pastures, fences, tragedies and marine reserves","Milon, JW","The literature on marine reserves has focused on biological effects and given little attention to the ways in which economic and governance dimensions determine the social viability of marine reserves. Here, I evaluate, in light of recent simulation model results, the bioeconomic rational for spatial access restrictions to correct a tragedy-of-the-commons problem in open-access fisheries. The analysis suggests that the most likely role for marine reserves is in management of complex, spatially differentiated, multispecies fisheries. Yet, this setting provides some of the most difficult challenges to effective governance of marine reserves. The success of marine reserves in fisheries management will depend on a careful matching of the attributes of a marine ecosystem and governance structures to create incentives for cooperation and efficiency.

Seagrass ecology at the turn of the millennium: challenges for the new century,"Duarte, CM","A review of the literature on seagrass ecology produced over the past decade (1989-1997) showed a sustained increase in the scientific production in international journals, with a doubling of the annual publication rate every four years. This production is highly concentrated in Aquatic Botany and three other journals (>50% of papers), involving contributors from 33 countries. Research efforts are growing rapidly in W. Europe, the Mediterranean Sea, the Caribbean Sea, and Australia. Studies on seagrass ecology also increase in NW America and SE Asia. Development of research is particularly strong in themes such as disturbance of seagrass meadows, and their growth, biogeochemistry and population dynamics. Yet, seagrass ecology is a rather imbalanced science, with half of the production produced by scientists from only two countries, examining only 10% of the seagrass flora from two biogeographic areas. Seagrass ecology is dominated by descriptive research (>60% of papers), with a paucity of efforts to synthesize results and derive general relationships. These characteristics result in a present lack of predictive ability, and scientific basis for the management of seagrass ecosystems. Coordination of research efforts in seagrass ecology has been limited, such that great uncertainty arises when scaling up the knowledge produced locally to assess seagrass resources at regional and global scales, Seagrass ecology must progress from the present descriptive stage to synthesis, either through large-scale comparative analyses or: the formulation of general models, yielding the power to predict the time course of seagrass decline and recovery and the role of seagrass meadows in the ecosystem. The development of a cooperative framework should contribute to expanding the scale of the research, develop the capacity to conduct new relevant research, establish a global network monitoring seagrass resources, and incorporate seagrass ecosystems into international programs examining the health and functioning of the oceans.

Current status and future needs for biological and environmental reference materials certified for methylmercury compounds,"Horvat, M","A good quality control/quality assurance programme should be implemented in all environmental or health related studies on mercury and its organic compounds, particularly, for monomethylmercury (MeHg) which is the most toxic mercury compound. This can be achieved initially by analysing suitable certified reference materials (CRMs), which are available from various producers such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) from USA, National Institute of Environmental Studies (NIES), National Research Council of Canada (NRCC), Standards, Measurements and Testing programme (SM&T) of the European Commission, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It is well understood that these materials are not covering present needs, as most of them are of the marine origin, while many laboratories are conducting research and monitoring in terrestrial ecosystems and fresh water environment. In addition, CRMs for human exposure assessment, such as blood, urine, and hair at several levels of concentrations are still lacking. Therefore, many other actions should be undertaken to achieve, improve and/or maintain quality of data, including participation in interlaboratory studies, proficiency testing and production of laboratory reference materials. A review of these actions has shown that MeHg compounds determination in samples such as soil, sediment and water is rather difficult and the results are also method dependent. In addition, it has been shown that some of the most frequently employed analytical methods may be a subject to spurious MeHg formation in the presence of high concentrations of inorganic mercury and organic matter. These findings have put a number of previous data on MeHg in question and consequently prompt actions were undertaken by a number of well experienced laboratories and producers of CRMs. So far, it is shown that the results obtained by various laboratories using different analytical techniques agree well with certified values in all RMs certified for MeHg. This suggests that comparability of data can be achieved, which however is not a guarantee of the true values. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The regional approach to management of marine pollution in the South Pacific,"Morrison, RJ","Marine pollution does not recognise maritime boundaries. Consequently, protection of the marine environment from pollution must involve an international cooperative effort, with near neighbours, in particular, working together to protect coastal and ocean areas close to their political boundaries. This paper describes a regional approach adopted from 1988 to 1994 in the South Pacific Region to address marine pollution problems. Some 25 countries and territories lie within the region. Apart from Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, the countries of the region consist basically of a large number of small islands separated by substantial stretches of ocean. Growing populations and demands for better living standards are exerting increasing pressures on coastal and marine resources, leading in some cases to significant marine pollution. The Region has limited financial and technical resources to address such problems and countries have therefore determined to assess and control them through a concerted regional approach.

Coulometric total carbon dioxide analysis for marine studies: assessment of the quality of total inorganic carbon measurements made during the US Indian Ocean CO2 Survey 1994-1996,"Johnson, KM; Dickson, AG; Eischeid, G; Goyet, C; Guenther, P; Key, RM; Millero, FJ; Purkerson, D; Sabine, CL; Schottle, RG; Wallace, DWR; Wilke, RJ; Winn, CD","Two single-operator multiparameter metabolic analyzers (SOMMA)-coulometry systems (I and II) for total carbon dioxide (TCO2) were placed on board the R/V Knorr for the US component of the Indian Ocean CO, Survey in conjunction with the World Ocean Circulation Experiment-WOCE Hydrographic Program (WHP), The systems were used by six different measurement groups on 10 WHP Cruises beginning in December 1994 and ending in January 1996. A total of 18,828 individual samples were analyzed for TCO2 during the survey. This paper assesses the analytical quality of these data and the effect of several key factors on instrument performance. Data quality is assessed from the accuracy and precision of certified reference material (CRM) analyses from three different CRM batches. The precision of the method was 1.2 mu mol/kg. The mean and standard deviation of the differences between the known TCO2 for the CRM (certified value) and the CRM TCO2 determined by SOMMA-coulometry were -0.91 +/- 0.58 (n = 470) and - 1.01 +/- 0.44 (n = 513) mu mol/kg for systems I and II, respectively, representing an accuracy of 0.05% for both systems. Measurements of TCO2, made on 12 crossover stations during the survey agreed to within 3 mu mol/kg with an overall mean and standard deviation of the differences of - 0.78 +/- 1.74 mu mol/kg (n = 600). The crossover results are therefore consistent with the precision of the CRM analyses. After 14 months of nearly continuous use, the accurate and the virtually identical performance statistics for the two systems indicate that the cooperative survey effort was extraordinarily successful and will yield a high quality data set capable of fulfilling the objectives of the survey.

Assessment of the quality of the shipboard measurements of total alkalinity on the WOCE Hydrographic Program Indian Ocean CO2 survey cruises 1994-1996,"Millero, FJ; Dickson, AG; Eischeid, G; Goyet, C; Guenther, P; Johnson, KM; Key, RM; Lee, K; Purkerson, D; Sabine, CL; Schottle, RG; Wallace, DWR; Lewis, E; Winn, CD","In 1995, we participated in a number of WOCE Hydrographic Program cruises in the Indian Ocean as part of the Joint Global Ocean flux Study (JGOFS) CO, Survey sponsored by the Department of Energy (DOE). Two titration systems were used throughout this study to determine the pH, total alkalinity (TA) and total inorganic carbon dioxide (TCO2) of the samples collected during these cruises. The performance of these systems was monitored by making closed cell titration measurements on Certified Reference Materials (CRMs). A total of 962 titrations were made on six batches of CRMs during the cruises. The reproducibility calculated from these titrations was +/-0.007 in pH, +/-4.2 mu mol kg(-1) in TA, and +/-4.1 mu mol kg(-1) in TCO2. The at-sea measurements on the CRMs were in reasonable agreement with laboratory measurements made on the same batches. These results demonstrate that the CRMs can be used as a reference standard for TA and to monitor the performance of titration systems at sea. Measurements made on the various legs of the cruise agreed to within 6 mu mol kg(-1) at the 15 crossover points. The overall mean and standard deviation of the differences at all the crossovers are 2.1 +/- 2.1 mu mol kg(-1). These crossover results are quite consistent with the overall reproducibility of the CRM analyses for TA (+/-4 mu mol kg(-1)) over the duration of the entire survey, The TA results for the Indian Ocean cruises provide a reliable data set that when combined with TCO2 data can completely characterize the carbonate system.

The Shetland site is part of a CSIRO global flask network with 10-12 sites, anchored to continuous high precision in situ measurements made at the Australian Cape Grim Baseline Station (40.7 degrees S, 144.7 degrees E), a primary station in the Global Atmosphere Watch programme (GAW) coordinated by the World Meteorological Organisation. The methodology is summarised, and Shetland results for CO2, CH4, N2O, CO, H-2 and delta(13)C, delta(18)O of CO2 presented for the period 1992-1996. We compare data to available results from surrounding stations of the NOAA cooperative network tin particular Mace Head, Ireland, 53.3 degrees N, 9.9 degrees W), and address issues of both trace species intercalibration and atmospheric spatial gradients. While considerable uniformity of trace-gas composition is evident in oceanic air over a 13 degrees range of latitude, nevertheless anomalies in CO2 concentration and isotopic composition are suggested in samples representing air to the west of Shetland. The potential for remotely monitoring integrated emissions from northern Europe is also identified. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"UNEP's Regional Seas Programme: approach, experience and future plans","Akiwumi, P; Melvasalo, T","The 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, UN Conference, 1972) outlined a 'masterplan' linking environmental assessment, environmental management and supporting measures as basic and inseparable elements of environmental actions plans. It also indicated the advantages of a regional approach in contributing to the solution of global problems. The Regional Seas Programme of UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) was subsequently initiated in 1974 (UN General Assembly, 1972). Development of UNEP's Regional Seas Programme demonstrated that the basic concepts formulated at Stockholm can effectively foster regional cooperation among interested States, and may benefit from the support of the United Nations system as a whole.The present Regional Seas Pro gramme includes fourteen regions, comprising over 140 coastal States. It was conceived as an action-oriented programme encompassing a comprehensive, trans-sectoral approach to marine and coastal areas and to environmental problems, considering not only the consequences, but also the causes of environmental degradation. Each Regional Seas Programme is based on the needs of the region concerned. The Regional Seas Programmes promote the parallel development of regional legal agreements, and of action-oriented programme activities, as embodied in the action plans. The overall strategy to be followed, as defined by UNEP's Governing Council (UNEP, 1974) is:Promotion of international and regional conventions, guidelines and actions for the control of marine pollution and the protection and management of aquatic resources.Assessment of the state of marine pollution, pollution sources and trends, and of the impact of pollution on human health, marine ecosystems and amenities.Coordination of efforts with regard to environmental aspects of the protection, development and management of marine and coastal resources.Support for education and training efforts to facilitate the full participation of developing countries in the protection, development and management of marine and coastal resources.Because the goal of each Regional Seas Programme is to benefit the States of that region, governments are involved from the very beginning in the formulation of the action plan. After acceptance, the implementation of the programme is carried out, under the overall authority of the governments concerned, by national institutions nominated by their governments. Although the Regional Seas Programme is implemented primarily by government-nominated institutions, specialized United Nations bodies, as well as the relevant international and regional organizations, contribute to its formulation, and also provide assistance to these national institutions. UNEP acts as an overall coordinator for the development and implementation of regional action plans. In some cases, this role is limited to the initial phase of the activities.

Dr N K Panikkar: learning research by doing,"Hempel, G","In this paper bilateral and multilateral research projects are discussed as particularly attractive means of external assistance to capacity building. The International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE; 1959-65) was the first large scale project with a strong component of capacity building, largely due to the farsighted efforts of Dr N.K. Panikkar. Recent examples described in the paper, include multilateral regional research projects in the Middle East and in the Benguela region as well as a bilateral study of the Brazilian mangroves. Combined research and training projects should be of long term nature and have to be based on full partnerships from the early planning through all phases of implementation, up to final publications. Each project should be of direct value for the sustainable development of the host country and the region, it should meet the following criteria: high scientific quality and good prospects for obtaining results of general scientific importance, and if possible, linked to ongoing international programmes in marine science and monitoring. It should be incorporated into the structure of scientific organisations of the host country and linked to other national or regional projects. The universities of the region and their academic teaching programmes should directly benefit from the programme. In the course of the project full use should be made of the data and experience already existing in the region. It should ensure full bilateral data exchange and provide links to international data storage and retrieval systems. Joint publications - preferably in English - in international journals as well as participation in international scientific meetings shall open the entry to the international marine science community.

Summary of IAEA-MEL's investigation of Kara Sea radioactivity and radiological assessment,"Povinec, PP; Osvath, I; Baxter, MS; Ballestra, S; Carroll, J; Gastaud, J; Harms, I; Huynh-Ngoc, L; Kwong, LLW; Pettersson, H","IAEA-MEL participated in five expeditions to the Kara Sea with the aim of assessing the radiological consequences of dumped radioactive wastes in the Novaya Zemlya Bays and Trough. The programme included sampling, in-situ underwater investigations, laboratory analyses of water, sediment and biota samples, the development of a marine radioactivity database, modelling and radiological assessment, the organization of intercomparison exercises and the evaluation of distribution coefficients. Radiometric investigations have shown that no radiologically significant environmental contamination has occurred. Leakages which have led to locally increased levels of radionuclides in sediment have only been observed in Stepovoy and Abrosimov Bays. Computer modelling results suggest that only radiological effects on local and regional scales may be of importance, The global radiological impact of the disposals in the Arctic Seas will be negligible.

The QUASIMEME laboratory performance studies (1993-1995): Overview of the nutrients section,"Aminot, A; Kirkwood, D; Carlberg, S","The QUASIMEME Project (1993-1996) was established to assist European laboratories to improve the data they produce in marine monitoring programmes. Through laboratory performance Studies (with six-monthly reports), workshops and expert visits the programme was fully interactive.There were five rounds of laboratory performance studies. For the nutrient section, in which about 50 laboratories took part, the reference materials distributed to the participants consisted of standard solutions of nutrients and seawater samples stabilized by autoclaving. The material included low and high concentrations typical of those encountered in coastal seawater; at least two samples with different concentrations were distributed in each round.Robust statistics were used to determine the means and standard deviations for each set of results. For inorganic nutrients, the assessment of the data for bias and precision was based mainly on a Z- and P-scoring system in which targets of +/- 6% were allocated to the high concentrations, likewise +/- 12.5% to the low concentrations.This overview discusses overall performance separately for nitrate plus nitrite, nitrite, ammonia, phosphate, total nitrogen and total phosphorus, and classifies the performance of individual laboratories in each round, while maintaining their anonymity. Performance for nitrate plus nitrite and nitrite improved steadily and these determinands are now fully under control; at the end of the programme, standard deviations (SD) for nitrate plus nitrite were 0.2 mu mol l(-1) at low concentration and 0.6 mu mol l(-1) (4%) at high concentration, and for nitrite they were 0.03 mu mol l(-1) and 0.06 mu mol l(-1) (5%) respectively. Phosphate showed a somewhat stable level of performance with SD of 0.06 mu mol l(-1) and 0.10 mu mol l(-1) (10%) at low and high concentrations respectively, but this could be improved. Ammonia proved the most difficult to determine, and in spite of a substantial improvement at the beginning of the exercise, this determinand is not under control in many laboratories. At low concentrations, ammonia shows a positive bias of 0.2 mu mol l(-1) and a SD of 0.3 mu mol l(-1), while at high concentrations SD reaches 0.5 mu mol l(-1) (20%). For total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), the exercises show that only two thirds of the participants produced consistent data for TN, and less than half of them produced consistent data for TP.

United States policy for mitigating global climate change,"Bergman, P; Kane, R; Kildow, J","The primary objective of this paper is to explain current U.S. policy on global climate change. U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) efforts to implement this policy will be described. A secondary objective of this paper is to discuss from a U.S. perspective the social and political efforts which must be initiated in order for ocean storage of CO2 to be considered as a viable CO2 mitigation option. The fact that the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) has not been successful in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is now recognized. Thus, U.S. policy has shifted towards the development of binding medium-term emissions targets and long-term atmosphere concentration goals. The U.S. believes these goals can be accomplished through the adoption of cost-effective joint implementation agreements and international emissions trading mechanisms. Studies are currently underway to assess specific targets and timetables for emissions reductions. Voluntary efforts on the part of U.S. industry have proven to be extremely successful in reducing U.S. CO2 emissions. The U.S. electric utility industry has taken the lead in voluntarily lowering greenhouse gas emissions under the DOE Climate Challenge Program. As of August, 1996, nearly 600 utility participants, accounting for over 60% of electric power generation in the U.S., have joined the program. Areas of research interest to DOE include the development of high efficiency advanced power generation cycles and CO2 sequestration technology. The U.S. currently spends $1.6 billion on understanding global climate phenomena and only $1.6 million on CO2 mitigation research. A number of socio-political considerations must be looked at in assessing the feasibility of ocean storage of CO2. Developing public trust appears to be a major concern in establishing the acceptability of ocean storage. Uncertainties in the effects of CO2 on marine life, potential safety hazards associated with pipelining, and ship transport of CO2 are all issues which must be dealt with as soon as possible. Some hidden costs associated with ocean disposal will also be discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Use of fish oil supplements is differently related to incidence of all-cause and vascular dementia among people with the distinct APOE epsilon 4 dosage,"Ma, H; Zhou, T; Li, X; Heianza, Y; Qi, L","Backgrounds &aims: Previous studies have shown that marine omega-3 PUFAs (fish oil) supplements was associated with improved cognitive function, whereas the association between use of fish oil supplements and risk of incident dementia was still unclear. We aimed to prospectively assess the relations between use of fish oil supplements and risks of all-cause and disease-specific dementia according to the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 dosage.Methods: A total of 445,961 participants from UK biobank, who were free of dementia at baseline and completed data on supplement use and genetic information were analyzed in this study. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) comparing incident dementia rates in participants who did and did not use fish oil.Results: During a median of 12.2 years of follow-up, a total of 5795 incident cases of dementia were documented, including 1266 cases of vascular dementia and 2382 cases of AD. After adjustment for covariates, use of fish oil supplements was significantly associated with lower risks of all-cause dementia (Hazard ratios, HR, 95% CI, 0.90, 0.85-0.96) and vascular dementia (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.97), but not AD (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.91-1.09). For all-cause dementia and vascular dementia, we found that the protective associations appeared to be attenuated by the increasing APOE epsilon 4 dosage (P-interaction = 0.002 and 0.002, respectively). Notably, the use of fish oil supplements was significantly associated with an 86.0% higher risk of vascular dementia in participants with two APOE-epsilon 4 alleles (HR, 1.86, 95%CI, 1.23-2.80).Conclusions: Our results indicate that use of fish oil supplements is differently associated with risks of all-cause dementia and vascular dementia according to the APOE epsilon 4 dosage.

"Fishers' knowledge on historical changes and conservation of Allis shad - Alosa alosa (Linnaeus, 1758) in Minho River, Iberian Peninsula","Braga, HO; Bender, MG; Oliveira, HMF; Pereira, MJ; Azeiteiro, UM","Diadromous allis shad A. alosa is a fish species of high socio-economic and cultural value along the Minho River, and is also susceptible to multiple anthropogenic threats. This study aimed to assess fishers' knowledge on artisanal fisheries of allis shad, and therefore assist and contribute to its conservation in northern Portugal. Results showed a negative relationship between the number of fish caught on the best day of allis shad fishing and the catch year (R-2 = 0.29; p = 0.04) and between the largest individual ever caught and the catch year (R-2 = 0.42; p = 0.01). There was a positive relationship between the largest individual ever caught and fishing experience (R-2 = 0.13; p = 0.04). Our findings showed a significant differences (F = 5.40; p = 0.01) between fishers' perceptions (Decrease, Increase, and Unchanged) of allis shad catches regarding fishing experience. Differences in perceptions of allis shad fisheries among fishers of different experience categories suggest the occurrence of the shifting baselines syndrome (SBS). The best fishing years were mainly around between 1950 and 1970, and the worst years of fishing in the most recent decades (1990 and 2010s.) Local management activities had low approval by fishers (I = 0.39). We suggest that fishers and managers must establish common conservation goals through participatory management. Also, a joint and synchronized approach between Portuguese and Spanish local authorities is essential for the management and conservation of A. alosa in the international section of the Minho River.

Artisanal fisheries institutionalization and equitable dialogue: the Anomalocardia brasiliana cockle case in the Pirajubae Marine Extractive Reserve,"Casagrande, A; Rover, OJ","This study analyzes the institutionalization of the cockle fishery (Anomalocardia brasiliana) in the Pirajubae Marine Extractive Reserve (RESEX) in Florianopolis - SC. For this, the automony of the artisanal fishers' and the presence of equitable dialogue between the actors were evaluated. The theoretical-methodological approach adopted is that of the sociology of translation, one of the strands derived from of the Actor-network theory - ANT. Bibliographic, documentary and field research was carry out. The institutionalization of the cockle fishery involves the formation of a sociotechnical network, whose trajectory includes four phases. These phases link specific fisheries management issues negotiated and translated by the different actors involved, such as: the ecological sustainability of fishery management, the construction of fair markets for the cockles and the recognition of the women's role in the extractive chain. The ecological sustainability of fishery management, through environmental regulation, was prioritized most of the time. The institutionalization was impacted by the creation of the protected area over the fishing territory, by conflicts originated from environmental inspection and urban infrastructure works, by consensus and tensions between scientific and traditional knowledge and, more recently, by the sudden collapse of fishery. The institutions created, such as the fishing rules, act as the mediators in the network defining roles and the rights and duties for the use of resources. The legitimacy of the institutions was greater when the equitable dialogue and the autonomy of fishers' was promoted in the decision-making process. Public policies for socioeconomic development and inclusion of women in Marine RESEX must be strengthened to ensure quality of life and equal conditions for social participation. The sociology of translation - ANT presents an innovative contribution to the study of common natural resources management, because it allows us to understand how institutions are produced and their role in the stabilization of sociotechnical networks, privileging co-production dynamics between the technical, social, economic and natural worlds.",2021,,DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE,58,,147-168,WOS:000757323700005,10.5380/dma.v58i0,,#20026,Casagrande 2021,,
Effect of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for patients receiving weight management interventions on eating behaviours and health-related quality of life,"Oliver, A; Hooper, S; Lau, R; Hutchinson, A","The rapid rise in obesity prevalence is life-style related and tackling this problem requires a pro-active multi-faceted approach to management. A private health care provider in Melbourne, Australia, developed a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for patients who had undergone bariatric surgery or receiving pharmacological weight loss treatments. The study aim was to assess the programs' effect on patients' quality of life, mental well-being, and eating behaviours.Methods: A prospective, observational, before and after study design was used. A total of 54 patients, 27 who had bariatric surgery and 27 receiving pharmacotherapy participated. Outcome measures were: change in weight and BMI, intuitive eating scale, impact of weight on quality of life scale and the depression, anxiety and stress scale.Results: Both medical and surgical patients reported improvements in their health-related quality of life and eating behaviours. Despite this, at program completion 71.4% of patients who had bariatric surgery reported severe anxiety and 52.4% severe stress levels.Conclusion: Participation in a rehabilitation program that provided patients with peer support and access to expert advice supported patients to make healthy eating choices and improved their quality of life.

Impact of obesity on influenza compared to pneumonia hospitalization outcomes,"Wei, C; Qian, F; Liu, Y; Maione, L; Hsu, HC; Hsu, WT; Lee, CC","Objectives: Previous literature has suggested that obesity impacts mortality risk differently in bacterial versus viral infections. This study sought to further elucidate this association in pneumonia versus influenza.Design: Retrospective cohort study.Setting and participants: Data were collected from the US Nationwide Readmission Database from 2013 to 2014.Methods: Patients were categorized into three weight groups: normal weight (BMI 18.5-25.0 kg/m(2)), obese (BMI 30-40.0 kg/m(2)), and morbidly obese (BMI >= 40 kg/m(2)). To minimize confounding, we excluded patients with a history of smoking, alcoholism, or chronic wasting conditions, as suggested by the Global BMI Mortality Collaboration. To further isolate obesity from baseline differences across cohorts, we performed a three-way propensity matching analysis. The association between body weight and in-hospital all-cause 30-day mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.Results: 132,965 influenza and 34,177 pneumonia hospitalizations were identified. For patients with influenza, obesity (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.01-2.26) and morbid obesity (HR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.10-2.44) were associated with higher in-hospital 30-day mortality compared to normal weight. For pneumonia, obesity (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20-0.84) and morbid obesity (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.96) were associated with reduced 30-day mortality compared to normal weight.Conclusions and implications: Obesity may increase 30-day mortality risk during influenza hospitalization but provide mortality benefit in pneumonia, a divergent effect not adequately explained by lower admission threshold.

Tourism-Based Alternative Livelihoods for Small Island Communities Transitioning towards a Blue Economy,"Praptiwi, RA; Maharja, C; Fortnam, M; Chaigneau, T; Evans, L; Garniati, L; Sugardjito, J","Tourism development has been promoted as an alternative livelihood to reduce the dependence of small island communities on declining marine resources. It is often central to emerging agendas around marine planning and the blue economy. However, relatively little is known about how communities perceive tourism development as an alternative and potentially sustainable livelihood in their area and its implications. This qualitative study tracks a governance system in transition and analyzes the factors perceived by stakeholders to be driving and hindering the adoption of tourism-based livelihoods on small islands in UNESCO's Taka Bonerate Kepulauan Selayar Biosphere Reserve (Indonesia). The findings indicate that, despite a series of tourism-enhancing investments and initiatives and the positive attitudes of local communities towards it, tourism is not a direct route towards sustainability for small island communities. The benefits of tourism are perceived to be unequally distributed. The lack of education and skills limits participation in new job opportunities, and the incentives to continue destructive fishing inhibits livelihood transition to tourism. The article concludes that tourism cannot be assumed to generate simultaneous benefits for conservation and development without more equitable benefit sharing, the meeting of basic needs in communities, and addressing the drivers of unsustainable livelihoods.",2021,,SUSTAINABILITY,13,12,,WOS:000667024600001,10.3390/su13126655,,#20029,Praptiwi 2021,,
Radiation distribution in inhomogeneous atmosphere-ocean system by discrete spherical harmonics method,"Fokou, A; Tapimo, R; Ymeli, GL; Tchinda, R; Kamdem, HTT","The distribution of the radiation in an inhomogeneous atmosphere-ocean system with smooth air-water interface is evaluated. The atmosphere and the ocean are considered as two semi-transparent media with an infinite horizontal extent and the polarization effects are ignored. The inhomogeneity of the system is characterized by the spatial variation of the optical properties of the media. The interaction between the radiation and the participating media is modeled by the radiative transfer equation. The difference in refractive index between the atmosphere and the ocean causes reflection and refraction phenomena to occur at the air-water interface. For determining the radiative characteristics throughout the system, the inhomogeneous media are divided into a finite number of homogeneous layers. The radiative transfer equation for each homogeneous layer is transformed into set of first-order differential equation using the discrete spherical harmonics method. Analytical characteristic solutions of the resulting system of differential equations are obtained using the eigenvalues decomposition. The radiances and the fluxes are then determined at any depth and angular directions within the atmosphere and the ocean. The evaluated relative errors of the discrete spherical harmonics method with respect to the discrete ordinate method are less than 0.6%. The main established advantage of the discrete spherical harmonics method is its low computational time compared to the discrete ordinate method and the spherical harmonics method from which it is inspired.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Green port structures and their ecosystem services in highly urbanized Japanese bays,"Okada, T; Mito, Y; Akiyama, YB; Tokunaga, K; Sugino, H; Kubo, T; Endo, T; Otani, S; Yamochi, S; Kozuki, Y; Kusakabe, T; Otsuka, K; Yamanaka, R; Shigematsu, T; Kuwae, T","Green port structures (i.e. green infrastructure in ports and harbors) featuring habitats for marine organisms have been promoted in Japan as part of a comprehensive policy to reduce the environmental impact of ports and carry out habitat conservation, restoration, and creation. In this study, we evaluated the ecosystem services provided by green port structures in two highly urbanized bays (Tokyo Bay and Osaka Bay) in Japan. Our results show that the provision of some ecosystem services can be limited by circumstances particular to ports and other areas with restricted access. In the case of green port structures that have strong usage restrictions, for example, cultural services can only be provided if relevant authorities are prepared to conduct public events while ensuring participant safety. On the other hand, green port structures with weak usage restrictions are often equipped with incidental facilities such as parking lots and restrooms; these facilities can enhance the provision of cultural services (e.g. recreation and environmental education). Green port structures in highly urbanized bays often have usage restrictions, but their proximity to large populations means that they can potentially provide numerous ecosystem services. However, our study shows that appropriate management goals, such as protecting species and ensuring healthy habitats, are needed to maintain the value of these services in highly urbanized and eutrophic bays.",2021,,COASTAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL,63,3,310-322,WOS:000648252700001,10.1080/21664250.2021.1911194,,#20031,Okada 2021,,
"International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas: structures, organization, and services for the management of kidney failure in Oceania and South East Asia","Ethier, I; Johnson, DW; Bello, AK; Ye, F; Osman, MA; Levin, A; Harris, DCH; Kerr, P; Liew, A; Wong, MG; Lunney, M; Saad, S; Zaidi, D; Khan, M; Jha, V; Tonelli, M; Okpechi, IG; Viecelli, AK","Oceania and South East Asia (OSEA) is a socioeconomically, culturally, and ethnically diverse region facing a rising epidemic of noncommunicable diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). The second iteration of the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas aimed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of kidney care in OSEA. Of the 30 countries/territories in OSEA, 15 participated in the survey, representing 98.5% of the region's population. The median prevalence of treated kidney failure in OSEA was 1352 per million population (interquartile range, 966-1673 per million population), higher than the global median of 787 per million population. Although the general availability, access, and quality of kidney replacement therapy (i.e., dialysis and transplantation) was high in OSEA, inequalities in accessibility and affordability of kidney replacement therapy across the region resulted in variability between countries. According to the survey results, in a third of the participating countries (mostly lower-income countries), less than half the patients with kidney failure were able to access dialysis, whereas it was readily available to all with minimal out-of-pocket costs in high-income countries; similar variability in access to transplantation was also recorded. Limitations in workforce and resources vary across the region and were disproportionately worse in lower-income countries. There was little advocacy for kidney disease, moderate use of registries, restricted CKD detection programs, and limited availability of routine CKD testing in some high-risk groups across the region. International collaborations, as seen in OSEA, are important initiatives to help close the gaps in CKD care provision across the region and should continue receiving support from the global nephrology community.

The Financial Impact on Reimbursement of Moderately Hypofractionated Postoperative Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer: An International Consortium Report,"Marta, GN; Ramiah, D; Kaidar-Person, O; Kirby, A; Coles, C; Jagsi, R; Hijal, T; Sancho, G; Zissiadis, Y; Pignol, JP; Ho, AY; Cheng, SHC; Offersen, BV; Meattini, I; Poortmans, P","Aims: Moderately hypofractionated breast irradiation has been evaluated in several prospective studies, resulting in wide acceptance of shorter treatment protocols for postoperative breast irradiation. Reimbursement for radiation therapy varies between private and public systems and between countries, impacting variably financial considerations in the use of hypofractionation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the financial impact of moderately hypofractionated breast irradiation by reimbursement system in different countries.Materials and methods: The study was designed by an international group of radiation oncologists. A web-questionnaire was distributed to representatives from each country. The participants were asked to involve the financial consultant at their institution.Results: Data from 13 countries from all populated continents were collected (Europe: Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, UK; North America: Canada, USA; South America: Brazil; Africa: South Africa; Oceania: Australia; Asia: Israel, Taiwan). Clinicians and/or departments in most of the countries surveyed (77%) receive remuneration based on the number of fractions delivered to the patient. The financial loss per patient estimated resulting from applying moderately hypofractionated breast irradiation instead of conventional fractionation ranged from 5-10% to 30-40%, depending on the healthcare provider.Conclusion: Although a generalised adoption of moderately hypofractionated breast irradiation would allow for a considerable reduction in social and economic burden, the financial loss for the healthcare providers induced by fee-for-service remuneration may be a factor in the slow uptake of these regimens. Therefore, fee-for-service reimbursement may not be preferable for radiation oncology. We propose that an alternative system of remuneration, such as bundled payments based on stage and diagnosis, may provide more value for all stakeholders. (C) 2020 The Royal College of Radiologists.

This goal is pursued by the Australian aquaculture, offshore engineering and renewable energy industries, research organisations and the government through the ""Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre"". To address the challenges of offshore food and energy production, lever-aging the benefits of co-location, vertical integration, infrastructure and shared services, will be enabled through the development of novel Multi-Purpose Offshore-Platforms (MPOP). The structural integrity of the designed systems when being deployed in the harsh offshore environment is one of the main challenges in developing the MPOPs. Employing structural reliability analysis methods for assessing the structural safety of the novel aquaculture-MPOPs comes with different limitations. This review aims at shedding light on these limitations and discusses the current status and future directions for structural reliability analysis of a novel aquaculture-MPOP considering Australia's unique environment. To achieve this aim, challenges which exist at different stages of reliability assessment, from data collection and uncertainty quantification to load and structural modelling and reliability analysis implementation, are discussed. Furthermore, several solutions to these challenges are proposed based on the existing knowledge in other sectors, and particularly from the offshore oil and gas industry. Based on the identified gaps in the review process, potential areas for future research are introduced to enable a safer and more reliable operation of the MPOPs.

Organic consumers? perceptions of environmental impacts of food overlap only partially with those considered by life cycle assessment,"Thomas, C; Maitre, I; Picouet, PA; Symoneaux, R","Current environmental issues require shifting to a more sustainable agri-food sector. The perception of the environmental impact of the products that consumers buy is not well known. The present study investigated consumers' perceptions of the environmental impacts related to the food chain. A group of 28 French buyers of organic products were questioned in a preliminary qualitative study, assuming buyers consume the products. Then, an online survey was conducted with 523 French organic buyers. Results showed that their perceptions included more than just pollution aspects, encompassing sustainability as a whole, including social (health) and economic (agricultural and other production activities) aspects. Results also highlighted that they did not understand certain impact categories used in life cycle assessment (LCA) to estimate environmental impacts because of the complex terms used (e.g. marine eutrophication, photochemical oxidant formation). The participants perceived that LCA did not consider some positive impacts that should be included when assessing environmental impacts. In addition, LCA impact categories were less broad than the participants' perceptions. This study suggests that developing new ecolabels needs a more holistic approach of the impacts of food, considering positive and negative impacts. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Roles and mechanisms of NRG1 in modulating the pathogenesis of NAFLD through ErbB3 signaling in hepatocytes (NRG1 modulates NAFLD through ErbB3 signaling),"Meng, D; Pan, HY; Chen, YW; Ding, JX; Dai, YN","Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an emerging chronic liver disease. However, the underlying mechanisms remained poorly understood. Neuregulin (NRG) family participate in energy metabolism, and might be related to NAFLD.Methods: L02 cells were exposed to oleic acid to establish a cellular model of NAFLD. We analyzed the NAFLD cells with NRG1 and subsequent ErbB3 siRNA treatment. Cellular total lipid was stained by Oil Red O, while triglyceride content and inflammation markers were measured by enzymatic kits. The expressions of down-stream molecules were evaluated by western blot. Results: In vitro, NRG1 could alleviate the steatosis of NAFLD, and inhibit the expression of IL-6 and TNF-a. The downregulation of ErbB3 aggravated steatosis, improved the levels of triglyceride, IL-6 and TNF-a in NRG1-treated NAFLD. Moreover, NRG1 treatment up-regulated ErbB3 phosphorylation, and increased the expression of PI3K and phosphorylation-AKT. When NRG1-treated NAFLD cells were transfected with ErbB3 siRNA, the expressions of ErbB3, p-ErbB3, p-AKT and PI3K were all reduced.Conclusion: NRG1 might play a protective role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD through ErbB3 phosphorylation to modulate the activation of PI3K-AKT pathway.

Association of counselor weight status and demographics with participant weight loss in a structured lifestyle intervention,"Dao, MC; Das, SK; Silver, RE; Roberts, SB","Objective: There is substantial variability in the effectiveness of group lifestyle interventions for weight loss. We examined associations between intervention weight loss counselors and participant weight loss and program engagement in a structured lifestyle intervention.Methods: Data were from 575 adults (87% female, 51 (12) years, baseline BMI: 32.4 (7.2) kg/m(2)) in an 11-week structured group lifestyle program. Participants self-enrolled in groups led by 11 weight loss counselors based on meeting times. All weight loss counselors received the same training. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate counselor predictors of participant percent (%) weight loss and program engagement (weight reporting throughout 11 weeks).Results: Of the 575 participants, 415 (72%) defined as complete reporters, i.e. reported weight weekly, lost a mean 7.3% weight (range: +3.1% to 16.2%). Participant weight loss differed between weight loss counselors (p = 0.003), and adjusted mean participant weight loss by weight loss counselor ranged from 6% to 9%. Weight loss was greater for weight loss counselors with a graduate degree in nutrition than weight loss counselors with another graduate degree (8.3% versus 6.4%, p = 0.05), but was not different between weight loss counselors with and without graduate degrees. Higher counselor BMI was associated with higher participant weight loss (p = 0.005).Conclusions: These results demonstrate the potential for quantitatively important effects of weight loss counselor characteristics on participant success and engagement in structured lifestyle interventions, indicating a need for research in this area.

Effects of a single bout of short-duration high-intensity and long-duration low-intensity exercise on insulin resistance and adiponectin/leptin ratio,"Kao, HH; Hsu, HS; Wu, TH; Chiang, HF; Huang, HY; Wang, HJ; Yang, GR; Lin, WY","Objectives: Moderate-intensity exercise improves insulin sensitivity, which may depend on the intensity, duration, and frequency of exercise. We examined the effects of a single bout of short-duration high-intensity exercise (HIE) and long-duration lowintensity exercise (LIE) on insulin sensitivity and the adiponectin/leptin ratio in individuals with different body mass indices (BMIs) who do not exercise regularly.Methods: We enrolled 42 healthy volunteers aged 20-64 years and divided them into two groups based on BMI: BMI < 24 kg/m(2) and BMI >= 27 kg/m(2). They were randomly assigned to either the short-duration (20 min) HIE (70%-80% heart rate reserve, HRR) or long-duration (60 min) LIE training groups (30%-40% HRR). Glucose, insulin, adiponectin, and leptin levels were assessed before training and at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min after training.Results: We finally analyzed 27 normal weight and 9 obese individuals. No significant differences were observed in the baseline information of both BMI groups. Homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance significantly improved for both exercise patterns in the normal weight group and for the HIE pattern in the obese group (P < 0.01), whereas the adiponectin/leptin ratio increased significantly only among normal weight participants with the LIE intervention.Conclusion: Both exercise patterns in BMI <24 kg/m(2) and BMI >= 27 kg/m(2) benefit on insulin resistance. Therefore, people can choose the way they can fit to improve insulin resistance both short-duration high-intensity exercise and long-duration low-intensity exercise.

The association of cortisol levels with leukocyte distribution is disrupted in the metabolic syndrome,"Mauss, D; Herr, RM; Jarczok, MN; Motoc, I; Fischer, JE; Bosch, A","Background: Leukocyte glucocorticoid sensitivity (GCS) pertains to the responsivity of leukocytes to the regulating actions of glucocorticoids, such as cortisol. Impaired endocrine regulation may link the metabolic syndrome (MetS) to the development of cardiovascular disease. We tested if the physiological association between endogenous cortisol levels and peripheral leukocyte composition becomes disrupted in individuals with MetS. Methods: MetS was assessed among 689 German industrial employees. The covariance between cortisol levels and hematologic parameters (i.e., proportions of neutrophils and lymphocytes) and their ratio was explored, which has been proposed as a proxy for GCS in vivo. Cortisol level before blood collection was assessed by repeated saliva collection, and the area under the curve was calculated. Linear regression models were adjusted for potential confounders including age, gender, BMI, income, and lifestyle factors. Results: Cortisol levels did not differ between subgroups. Participants without MetS (n = 552) showed the expected association of cortisol with hematologic parameters (i3 = 0.207 to 0.216; p values 0.001). No association (i3 = 0.078 to 0.083; p values 0.10) was found among those with MetS (n = 137), consistent with a reduced GCS. Analyses of separate MetS components showed that reduced GCS was associated specifically with decreased high-density lipoprotein and elevated fasting plasma glucose. Conclusions: Utilizing a novel statistical approach to infer GCS, this study provided first epidemiological evidence of aberrant physiological regulation of leukocyte distribution by endogenous cortisol levels among individuals with MetS. These findings underline the idea that MetS may involve disruption of endocrine-immune regulation. (c) 2020 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Different degree of intervention in 6-month weight-loss support and arterial stiffness: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial,"Tanabe, Y; Nakata, Y; Zempo-Miyaki, A; Hieda, MY; Choi, Y; Fujii, N; Maeda, S","Background and aims: Weight reduction by lifestyle modification (i.e., low-calorie diet and/or exercise) decreases arterial stiffness in overweight or obese individuals. We previously demonstrated that weight loss differs depending on the degree of intervention in weight-loss support in a randomized controlled trial (UMIN000001259). However, the effect of different degrees of intervention on arterial stiffness remains unclear.Methods and results: A total of 188 middle-aged men and women with overweight or obesity (51 +/- 7 years, BMI: 29.0 +/- 3.2 kg/m(2)) participated in the 6-month trial wherein they were assigned to a low (LI, n = 63), moderate (MI, n = 62), or high intensive intervention (HI, n = 63) group. Initially, one motivational lecture on weight loss was provided to all three groups, whereas educational materials (textbooks, notebooks, and a pedometer) were provided to groups MI and HI. Additionally, the HI group participated in a series of group-based sessions. Body weight and arterial stiffness assessed by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were measured at 0, 3, and 6 months. Six-month weight loss was greater in the order of HI, MI, and LI groups. The interventions reduced baPWV in all groups, and the reduction was not significantly different among the groups (114.3 +/- 16.3, 82.6 +/- 15.2, and 98.8 +/- 90.4 cm/s, respectively).Conclusion: In overweight or obese individuals, different degrees of intervention in weight-loss support affect body weight; however, the extent to which arterial stiffness improves does not differ among support programs.

Functional metagenomic and enrichment metatranscriptomic analysis of marine microbial activities within a marine oil spill area,"Song, BK; Li, ZH; Li, S; Zhang, ZZ; Fu, QT; Wang, SJ; Li, L; Qi, ST","Microorganisms can degrade petroleum hydrocarbons, providing the advantages of low cost and few side effects towards ecosystems. Here, we evaluated the mechanisms of microbial degradation of marine petroleum hydrocarbon using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approaches in order to provide new insight into microbial degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon. Seawater samples were collected at a depth of similar to 8 m from an area near a drilling platform in the Bohai Bay and metagenomic sequencing was used to evaluate the functional potential of these marine microbial communities. Metatranscriptomic sequencing, fluorescence in-situ hybridization experiments, and flow cytometry were also performed on the microbial communities of samples subjected to 12 different culture conditions. The data were also subjected to Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and co-transcription data visualization to evaluate co-transcription of gene functions. Metagenomic sequencing indicated the presence of numerous genes that were related to petroleum hydrocarbon metabolism. Further, the high co-transcription of genes in multiple pathways, indicated that groups of genes were synergistically transcribed to metabolize petroleum hydrocarbons. Metatranscriptomics also showed that microbial metabolism was highly active in the enrichments and that the transcription of a large number of prokaryotic replication and repair genes were significantly up-regulated including those encoding for the type VI secretion system (T6SS) protein, DNA polymerase I, thymidine phosphorylase, mevalonate kinase, and two-component systems. Concomitantly, the transcription of ribosomal genes involved in translation and photosynthetic genes involved in energy metabolism were down-regulated. Overall, oil and oxygen presence can increase the oil-degradation rates and related genes' transcription. Lot different metabolisms are co-regulated to exploit nutrients derived from the metabolism of petroleum hydrocarbons. Our analysis of metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and degradation data in this study show that a widespread gene spectrum involved in oil-degradation and the cooperation among genes is of great importance.

SIMPLIFIED AERODYNAMIC LOADING MODEL FOR NON-PRODUCTION CONDITIONS FOR FLOATING WIND SYSTEMS DESIGN,"Amer Soc Mech Engineers; Alexandre, A; Antonutti, R; Gentils, T; Mutricy, L; Weyne, P","Floating wind is now entering a commercial-stage, and there are a significant number of commercial projects in countries like France, Japan, UK and Portugal. A floating wind project is complex and has many interdependencies and interfaces. During all stages of the project several participants are expected to use a numerical model of the whole system and not only the part the participant has to design. Examples of this are the mooring and floater designer requiring a coupled model of the whole system including also the wind turbine, the operations team requiring a model of the system to plan towing and operations. All these stakeholders require a coupled model where the hydrodynamics, aerodynamics and structural physics of the system are captured with different levels of accuracy.In this paper, we will concentrate on a simplified model for the aerodynamic loading of the turbine in idling and standstill conditions that can be easily implemented in a simulation tool used for floater, mooring and marine operations studies.The method consists of using a subset of simulations at constant wind speed (ideally close to the wind speed required for the simulations) run on a detailed turbine model on a rigid tower and fixed foundation - normally run by the turbine designer. A proxy to the aerodynamic loads on the rotor and nacelle (RNA) is to take the horizontal yaw bearing loads. The process is then repeated for a range of nacelle yaw misalignments (for example every 15 degrees for 360 degrees). A look-up table with the horizontal yaw bearing load for the range of wind-rotor misalignments investigated is created. The simplified model of the aerodynamic loads on the RNA consists of a fixed blade (or wing) segment located at the hub, where aerodynamic drag and lift coefficients can be specified. Using the look-up tables created using the detailed turbine model, drag and lift coefficients are estimated as a function of the angle between the rotor and the wind direction.This representation of the aerodynamic loading on the RNA was then verified against full-field turbulent wind simulations in fixed and floating conditions using a multi-megawatt commercial turbine. The results for the parameters concerning the floater, mooring and marine operations design were monitored (e.g. tower bottom loads, offsets, pitch, mooring tensions) for extreme conditions and the errors introduced by this simplified rotor are generally lower than 4%. This illustrates that this simplified representation of the turbine can be used by the various parties of the project during the early stages of the design, particularly when knowing the loading within the RNA and on higher sections of the tower is not important.",2021,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 2021 3RD INTERNATIONAL OFFSHORE WIND TECHNICAL CONFERENCE (IOWTC2021),,,,WOS:000672533600023,,,#20043,AmerSocMechEngineers 2021,,
"Environmental enrichment, training, and habitat characteristics of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus)","Lauderdale, LK; Walsh, MT; Mellen, JD; Granger, DA; Miller, LJ","In recent decades, animal welfare science has evolved to utilize a multidisciplinary approach to assess the welfare of animals in accredited zoos and aquariums. Science-based animal welfare assessments have become an essential component of management programs and widespread application is expected by animal care professionals. Management practices for bottlenose dolphins in accredited facilities incorporate several programs that potentially impact animal welfare including environmental enrichment and animal training. Additionally, habitat characteristics, such as the dimensions of the habitat, have been proposed to affect welfare. While accredited facilities are required to meet high standards of care, habitat characteristics and management practices are not standardized across locations. Knowledge and subsequent application of these practices and habitat characteristics can enhance our understanding of factors associated with positive welfare. As part of a larger study of dolphin welfare titled ""Towards understanding the welfare of cetaceans in zoos and aquariums"" (colloquially called the Cetacean Welfare Study), survey data were collected from 86 bottlenose dolphins in 40 habitats at 38 facilities in seven countries. The major aims of this paper are to provide general descriptive information regarding dolphin management in accredited zoos and aquariums and to provide supplemental context to the other research published from the Cetacean Welfare Study data set. This paper provides a review of current habitat characteristics and management practices at those 38 accredited zoos and aquariums. These data enabled the identification and quantification of how cetacean management practices differed between participating facilities accredited by the Alliance for Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums and the Association of Zoos & Aquariums. Variables were selected based on their potential association with welfare including the physical habitat, environmental enrichment, and training programs.

Relationships between animal management and habitat characteristics with two potential indicators of welfare for bottlenose dolphins under professional care,"Miller, LJ; Lauderdale, LK; Mellen, JD; Walsh, MT; Granger, DA","Accredited zoos and aquariums continually strive to ensure high levels of animal welfare for the animals under their professional care. Best management practices include conducting research to better understand factors that lead to optimal welfare and then turning findings into practice. The current study is part of the larger Cetacean Welfare Study or more formally, ""Towards understanding the welfare of cetaceans in zoos and aquariums."" Facilities participating in the study were accredited by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums and/or the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Animal management factors and habitat characteristics were examined in relation to two potential indicators of welfare for common (Tursiops truncatus) and Indo-Pacific (Tursiops aduncus) bottlenose dolphins. Specifically, we examined environmental enrichment, animal training, and habitat characteristics that were significantly related to behavioral diversity and route tracing, a form of stereotypic behavior. Behavior was recorded from 47 animals at 25 facilities around the world. Overall, the rate of route tracing behavior observed during the study was very low and few animal management factors or habitat characteristics were found to be related to this behavior. One factor, enrichment diversity, had a significant positive relationship with route tracing and an inverse relationship with behavioral diversity. This finding may be a product of a response mounted by animal care specialists to the behavior as opposed to a cause. Animals that engaged in this behavior were likely provided more diverse enrichment in attempts to ameliorate the stereotypic behavior. However, multiple factors were found to significantly relate to behavioral diversity, a potential positive indicator of welfare for bottlenose dolphins. Dolphins that were trained on a predictable schedule had higher behavioral diversity than those on a semi-predictable schedule. There was a positive significant relationship between behavioral diversity and the number of habitats to which an animal had access, and a significant inverse relationship with the maximum depth of the habitat. Finally, animals that were split into groups and reunited or rotated between subgroups had higher behavioral diversity than animals managed in the same group. Information gained from the current study suggested that animal management techniques may be more important in ensuring good welfare for bottlenose dolphins than focusing on habitat size.",2021,,PLOS ONE,16,8,,WOS:000729151200016,10.1371/journal.pone.0252861,,#20045,Miller 2021,,

All participating facilities were accredited by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums and/or the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Behavioral data were collected on 47 bottlenose dolphins representing two subspecies, Tursiops truncatus and Tursiops aduncus, at 25 facilities. The social behaviors of group related activity (group active) as well as interacting with conspecifics (interact with conspecific) were examined for their relationships to both animal management factors and habitat characteristics. The behavioral state of group active and the rate of interact with conspecific were both positively related to the frequency of receiving new forms of environmental enrichment. Both were inversely related to the random scheduling of environmental enrichment. Additional results suggested interact with conspecific was inversely related with daytime spatial experience and that males displayed group active more than females. Overall, the results suggested that animal management techniques such as the type and timing of enrichment may be more important to enhance social behavior than habitat characteristics or the size of the habitat. Information gained from this study can help facilities with bottlenose dolphins manage their enrichment programs in relation to social behaviors.",2021,,PLOS ONE,16,8,,WOS:000729151200014,10.1371/journal.pone.0253732,,#20046,Miller 2021,,
The Association of Daily Physical Activity Behaviors with Visceral Fat,"Ando, S; Koyama, T; Kuriyama, N; Ozaki, E; Uehara, R","The association between health benefits and physical activity has received increasing attention among researchers working on the prevention of noncommunicable disease. However, the number of studies on the association between daytime activities and visceral fat is limited. In this study, we evaluated how daily physical activity behaviors impact the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and body mass index (BMI).A total of 3543 participants (1240 men, 2303 women) were included in this cross-sectional study. The duration of daily physical activities (sedentary time, standing time, and walking time) was classified into the six categories. Multiple regression analysis was carried out to compare continuous variables. VAT and BMI were used as dependent variables, and the daily physical activities were used as independent variables. All results were expressed after adjusting for confounders, including sex, age, Brinkman index, daily alcohol consumption, sleeping time, and medication for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes.The multiple regression analysis showed that sedentary time was significantly associated with VAT (beta = 1.145, p value = 0.002), whereas standing time was negatively associated with VAT (beta = -0.763, p value = 0.043). Walking time was negatively and robustly associated with all depending variables as follows: BMI (beta = -0.172, p value = 0.001) and VAT (beta = -2.023, p value <0.001).This study showed that a daily behavior time affects the accumulation of VAT and BMI. A shift from sedentary time to standing or walking time might be a key population approach to prevent cardiometabolic diseases. (c) 2020 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

Precision of the Hologic Horizon A dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in the assessment of body composition,"Cheung, YM; Roff, G; Grossmann, M","Background: As the number of individuals with obesity increases, so too will the demand for a precise, cost-effective and safe method to better risk-stratify this heterogenous population. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area, a body composition measurement has been associated with the many facets of the metabolic syndrome.Aim: To determine the precision of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in providing body composition measurements, including VAT area, using the Hologic Horizon A scanner.Method: Thirty participants (mean age 64 years, 47% male), underwent two sequential body composition scans. The coefficient of variation (CV) and least significant change (LSC) were calculated for android/gynoid ratio, appendicular lean/height(2), lean/height(2), total body fat and lean mass, total body mass, and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and VAT area. Participants were stratified according to age (70 or >= 70 years), body mass index (BMI) (<= 30 kg/m(2) or 30 kg/m(2)) and sex (male or female). The CV was calculated for each parameter and then analysed for differences between groups.Results: The CV for all parameters was <3% with the exception of SAT (3.86%). The CV of VAT area was 2.63% with a LSC at 95% confidence of 7.28%. Apart from the CV differences between males and females for android/gynoid ratio (male: 3.56% vs. female: 1.74%, p = 0.01) and SAT area (5.04% vs. 2.46%, p = 0.01), there were no significant differences identified between the calculated CV for all other body composition parameters when participants were stratified by age, BMI and sex.Conclusion: DXA scanning, using the Hologic Horizon A system, is capable of providing precise body composition measurements.

"Obesity, Akkermansia muciniphila, and Proton Pump Inhibitors: Is there a Link?","Davis, JA; Collier, F; Mohebbi, M; Stuart, AL; Loughman, A; Pasco, JA; Jacka, FN","Objective: The gut bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), has been linked to body composition and metabolism. However, the role of lifestyle factors and medication use in these relationships has not been considered. This study aimed to assess the relative abundance of A. muciniphila in participants and investigate its association with obesity, with consideration of potential confounding factors.Methods: Participants included 158 men of the Geelong Osteoporosis Study with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry data, 16S rRNA gene bacterial profiling of stool samples, and lifestyle data. The relative abundance of A. muciniphila was estimated from total sequence reads, while obesity status was quantified by fat mass index (FMI, kg/m(2)).Results: In this cohort (66 12 yr, mean +/- SD), the most common medications were proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (28%), and these were associated with both high FMI and decreased abundance of A. muciniphila. Before and after adjustments for PPIs, participants with substantial A. muciniphila (abundance >= 0.1%, n = 94) compared to very low (abundance <0.1%, n = 64), had lower FMI (adjusted -1.33 (95%CI -2.30, -0.36) kg/m(2), p = 0.007).Conclusions: In this sample, relative abundance of A. muciniphila was inversely associated with high FMI, independent of PPI use. The relationship between obesity, reflux medication, and the gut microbiome warrants further investigation. (c) 2020 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Obesity and sleep disorders: A nationwide study of 1.3 million Israeli adolescents,"Geva, N; Pinhas-Hamiel, O; Frenkel, H; Shina, A; Derazne, E; Tzur, D; Afek, A; Goldbart, AD; Twig, G","Objectives: To assess the association between sleep disorders prevalence and obesity in Israeli adolescents.Methods: A nationwide, population-based, cross-sectional study of 1,348,817 Israeli adolescents (57% males) who were medically examined prior to military service between 1997 and 2015; height and weight were measured along with assessment of medical status at age 17.3 +/- 0.4 years. The diagnosis of a sleep disorder was made based on objective diagnostic criteria. The prevalence and odds ratio (OR) for a sleep disorder were computed across BMI subgroups and were adjusted for socio-demographic confounders.Results: Overall sleep disorders prevalence was 1.8:1000 (males) and 0.45:1000 (females), with a total of 1601 cases. There was a gradual increase in the odds ratio for sleep disorders with increasing BMI. Multivariable-adjusted ORs for sleep disorders were 1.29 (95% CI 1.10-1.52), 1.44 (1.18-1.75), 3.03 (2.32-3.96) and 3.38 (1.98-5.75) for overweight, obese class I, II and III, respectively (5th-49th BMI percentile was the reference). Results persisted in extensive sensitivity analyses including limiting the study sample to participants with unimpaired health.Conclusions: We found a higher prevalence of sleep disorders in males and a dose-dependent association between sleep disorders and adolescent BMI in both sexes. Our findings warrant clinical awareness among healthcare providers, given the rise in obesity in teenagers, and particularly in light of the obesity epidemic that we are experiencing in this era. Sleep related complaints should be actively screened in adolescents who suffer obesity. (c) 2020 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Geographic variation in the statin trials: Underrepresentation of Asian populations,"Adams, C; Singh, K","Background: Globalisation has seen a shift towards international multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The amalgamation of heterogenous patient populations is thought to be responsible for the geographic variation in treatment effect noted in recent trials. Furthermore, there is significant underrepresentation of lower- income countries in cardiovascular disease (CVD) research. These issues raise important questions about the generalisability of these trial results. Given the central role of statin therapy in CVD risk reduction, we evaluated for geographic variation in treatment effect in the primary and secondary prevention statin RCTs.Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search using the terms: ""statin"", ""coronary disease"", ""reduce"" and ""cholesterol"". We included statin RCTs with >1000 participants, therapy >2 years and CVD outcomes. We analysed each study for regional recruitment data and geographic subgroup analysis.Results: From an initial 2154 studies, we identified 20 eligible for inclusion. This amounted to 138,612 participants across multiple continents including Europe 69,086 (49.8%), Asia 14,672 (10.6%), South America 5128 (3.7%), North America 33,393 (24.1%), Oceania 9445 (6.8%) and Africa 2801 (2%). Data were unavailable for 4087 (2.9%) participants. Despite together comprising 35% of the world's population, China and India represented only 2.7% and 1.3% of the studied population respectively. None of the 6 multi-continent trials provided regional analysis.Conclusion: We were unable to identify significant geographic variation in the outcomes of the statin RCTs, primarily due to a lack of data. We also observed regarding statin RCT data, there is limited involvement of countries with the greatest burden of CVD. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Social impacts of European Protected Areas and policy recommendations,"Jones, N; Graziano, M; Dimitrakopoulos, PG","Effective designation of Protected Areas (PAs) requires the careful consideration of their social impacts as these are perceived by people. These refer to a variety of issues such as the distribution of power, social equity, social relations and more importantly the impact of PAs on human wellbeing. A number of studies have emerged in the past decade aiming to capture social impacts of PAs across the world through non-monetary assessments taking into consideration people's perceptions. Although Europe is the region with the largest in proportion number of Protected Areas across the world it is also a region with very limited scientific evidence on this topic. As the European Union is preparing to implement its new Biodiversity Strategyto ipkmplement this paper aims to provide the first comprehensive review of the literature regarding social impacts of European PAs and highlight new directions for current policy frameworks in the region. The paper focuses on the perceived non-economic social costs and benefits of PAs and identifies 7 key categories of social impacts.

Splenic participation in glycemic homeostasis in obese and non-obese male rats,"de Souza, TA; de Souza, DW; Siqueira, BS; Rentz, T; Emilio, HRD; Grassiolli, S","We evaluated the effects of splenectomy on glucose homeostasis in obese and non-obese rats. Obesity was induced by subcutaneous injections of monosodium glutamate (MSG; 4 g/kg) in neonatal rats. Control (non-obese) animals received equimolar saline. Splenectomy (SPL) was performed at 21 or 60 days of life (SPL21 and SPL60) in MSG obese and non-obese groups. Glucose tolerance, insulin resistance (IR), adiposity, histology of white adipose tissue (WAT) depots and glucose-induced insulin secretion (GIIS) in isolated pancreatic islets were evaluated at 90 days of life. In non-obese, despite of hyperphagia, the spleen ablation reduced body weight gain and energy efficiency, without changes in GIIS or IR. Slight reduction in glucose tolerance and augmented adipocyte size in subcutaneous WAT was noted in non-obese SPL21 group. In MSG-SPL21 rats was observed augmented body weight gain and energy efficiency, without alter adipocyte size. In contrast, MSG-SPL60 rats had lower body weight gain, reduced energy efficiency and smaller adipocyte size in WAT visceral depot in relation to MSG non-operated. Spleen ablation reduced insulin plasma levels in the MSG-SPL21 and MSG-SPL60 groups. Moreover, splenectomy reduced GIIS and improved glucose tolerance in MSG-SPL21 group. In MSG-SPL60 rats were observed reduction in IR, without changes in GIIS, despite of elevated glucokinase expression in pancreatic islets. In conclusion, spleen ablation reduces body weight in non-obese rats and slightly modifies glucose homeostasis. In contrast, in MSG-induced obesity, absence of the spleen can ameliorate glucose tolerance and reduce insulin secretion, improving insulin sensitivity.

Body composition influences blood pressure during submaximal graded test in women,"Kerherve, HA; Harvey, LM; Eagles, AN; McLellan, C; Lovell, D","This study aimed to determine whether body composition affected cardiovascular responses of normal, overweight and obese women by comparing heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) during a graded submaximal treadmill exercise. Thirty five healthy non-smoking, premenopausal women (age 30.8 +/- 9.5 yr; height 1.66 +/- 0.05 m; weight 73.8 +/- 18.9 kg; body fat 36.2 +/- 9.5%; maximum oxygen uptake 33.5 +/- 8.1 mL.min.kg(-1)) volunteered for this study, and were classified into three groups based on BMI: normal weight (NOR; <= 24.9 kg.m(2)), overweight (OVW; 25-29.9 kg.m(2)) and obese (OBE; >= 30 kg.m(2)). Participants performed a submaximal graded test at 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% of maximal oxygen uptake, during which HR, systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured. At rest, participants of OBE group had higher BP than NOR and OVW. During the submaximal graded test, HR, SBP and MAP increased as a function of intensity. There were no group differences in HR, but greater SBP, DBP and MAP in OBE compared to NOR and OBW at all intensities except 60%. Overall, our study further contributes to underscore the importance of stress testing specifically to evaluate the increased risks apparently healthy obese women are placed at to developing diseases from the chronic exposure to raised BP, despite normal resting BP and HR responses during exercise.

The effectiveness of psychosocial interventions to support psychological well-being in post-operative bariatric patients: A systematic review of evidence,"Van Zyl, N; Andrews, L; Williamson, H; Meyrick, J","Background: Bariatric surgery is considered an effective obesity management intervention for individuals with a BMI greater than 40, or 35 with co-morbidities. However, research documents that psychological difficulties prevalent amongst individuals seeking surgery may persist post-operatively. This systematic review aims to assess the evidence to show which psychosocial interventions support psychological well-being post-operatively.Methods: The review is registered with Prospero (CRD42018100280), complying with PRISMA guidelines. The research protocol included grey literature and database searches of psychosocial interventions for post-operative bariatric patients, between November 2017 and September 2019. The primary outcome was psychological well-being; secondary outcomes included weight loss maintenance and quality of life (QoL). The primary reviewer screened titles and extracted data. Study quality was assessed independently by two reviewers, using the Effective Public Health Practice Project criteria. Due to heterogeneity across studies, narrative synthesis was considered suitable for data analysis.Results: Ten studies met inclusion criteria. Psychosocial intervention content was delivered in a variety of ways (e.g., clinic, internet-based). Overall, participants (N = 382, Mage = 46.4) receiving psychosocial interventions post bariatric surgery, demonstrated improvements in psychological well-being and weight loss maintenance, compared to baseline measures and/or controls. The strength of evidence is currently limited by the small number of studies found and study quality, limiting the power to detect clinically meaningful changes; findings should therefore be considered preliminary.Conclusion: Preliminary findings suggest that interdisciplinary interventions including acceptance-based approaches, psychoeducation, nutrition and lifestyle modification, delivered 1-year post-operative, are promising. Further scientific enquiry is warranted with well-designed studies and long-term follow-ups. (c) 2020 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Quantitative proteomic analysis provides insights into the algicidal mechanism of Halobacillus sp. P1 against the marine diatom Skeletonema costatum,"Zhang, SF; Han, BB; Wu, FX; Huang, HH","Algicidal behavior is a common interaction between marine microalgae and bacteria, especially in the dissipationphase of algal blooms. The marine bacterium Halobacillus sp. P1 was previously isolated and exhibits high algicidal activity against the diatom Skeletonema costatum. However, little is known about the mechanism underlying this algicidal process. Here, a tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomic approach was coupled with physiological analysis to investigate the cellular responses of S. costatum when treated with P1 culture supernatant. Among the 4582 proteins identified, 82 and 437 proteins were differentially expressed after treatment for 12 and 24 h, respectively. The proteomic results were in accordance with the results of verification by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assays. Proteins involved in reactive oxygen species scavenging, protein degradation and transport were upregulated, while proteins participating in nitrogen metabolism, protein translation, photosynthetic pigment biosynthesis and cell cycle regulation were significantly downregulated (p-value =0.05), corresponding to the increasing malondialdehyde content and the decreasing nitrogen, protein and chlorophyll a contents. A nutrient competitive relationship might exist between the bacterium P1 and S. costatum, and the inhibition of nitrogen metabolism by the P1 culture supernatant might be the key lethal factor that results in the dysfunction of S. costatum metabolism. Our study sheds light on the algicidal mechanism of P1 at the molecular level and provides new insights into algae-bacteria interactions. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Nuclear Cardiology in Asia,"Hatazawa, J; Sabih, D; Li, YM; Pradhan, PK; Paez, D","Nuclear cardiology for patients with ischemic heart disease and cardiac failure is expanding in Asia, although quite heterogeneously. In Asia, Israel showed the highest utilization with more than 1000 scans/100,000 inhabitants a year followed by Korea, Japan, UAE, Turkey, Australia (250-999 scans/100,000). Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Lebanon, Iran, and Pakistan practiced 60-99 scans/100,000. Most of South East Asian countries, China, India, and Bangladesh practiced 1-50 scans/100,000 per year. Countries in Central Asia, Mongolia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Lao, Myanmar, Nepal, and Bhutan showed limited use or no nuclear cardiology practice. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in Asia was characterized by more frequent use of Tl-201, less use of weight-based Tc-99m dosing, and a trend toward a lower rate of stress-only imaging. Accordingly, the effective dose in nuclear cardiology practices was higher than those of the rest of the world. Mo-99-Tc-99m generators are available in most countries, relying mainly on the global supply chain because there is little supply chain beyond countries within the region. In practice, the threshold values of left ventricular ejection fraction, end-systolic volume, and end-diastolic volume between normal and pathologic states were set based on the regional normal database in China and Japan because these values were dependent on age, gender, and body weight. The purpose of the MPI SPECT study was to evaluate myocardial ischemia in symptomatic patients with chest pain, effects of percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass-graft, and cardiac function in patients with chronic heart failure. The ability of Tc-99m-based MPI for predicting hard cardiac events was confirmed in Asian inhabitants with low risk of ischemic heart disease. Human resource development of nuclear medicine professional and public awareness of nuclear medicine is key issues to promote nuclear cardiology in Asia. International organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and academic organizations in the region such as Asia Oceania Federation of Nuclear Medicine and Biology, Asia Regional Cooperative Council for Nuclear Medicine, East Asia Nuclear Medicine Association, and Arab Society of Nuclear Medicine have an important role in addition to national Societies of Nuclear Medicine in each country and region.

Marital status and the prevalence of obesity in a Korean population,"Lee, J; Shin, A; Cho, S; Choi, JY; Kang, D; Lee, JK","Objective: Previous studies have reported on marital status and the prevalence of obesity; however, few studies have assessed the prevalence of underweight in relation to marital status. This study aimed to explore the association of obesity and abdominal obesity with marital status among Koreans aged 40-69 years. Methods: We selected a total of 137,608 participants from the Health Examinees Gem Study for the final analysis. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of obesity with marital status, with controlling for potential confounders. Results: The prevalence of underweight was higher in unmarried men (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.25-2.63) and women (OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.79-2.61) than in married individuals.

Considering the limited data available on this topic we aimed to investigate interactions between dietary patterns (DPs) and MC4R polymorphisms in relation to obesity phenotypes. Methods: This cohort study was performed in the framework of Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study; for eligible participants in this study (n = 3850), the median follow-up was 4 years. DPs were determined using factor analysis. The genotypes of polymorphisms (17782313rs and 12970134rs) were identified and their interaction with DPs were assessed in relation to incidence of obesity phenotypes including central obesity, general obesity and visceral adiposity dysfunction. Results: The mean age of participants (62.5% females) were 37.0 +/- 13.7 years. Two main DPs (healthy and unhealthy) were extracted. C-allele carriers of rs17782313 in higher quartiles of the healthy DP score had a significant decrease in the incidence of general obesity, compared to those who had the TT genotype (HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.42-0.89, P interaction = 0.01). For rs12970134 A-allele carriers, subjects in the second compared to the first quartile of the healthy DP score, had a significant decrease in the incidence of general obesity (HR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.46-0.99). There were no significant interaction between DPs and MC4R variants in relation to other obesity phenotypes.

The risk of developing disordered eating following a family-based program among children with overweight and obesity and their siblings: Retrospective and prospective analyses,"Shaharabany, B; Tepper, S; Berman, S; Golan, M","Background: Studies have raised the concern that dieting and weight-loss programs may be a potential risk factor for developing eating disorders, and may have a potential to affect siblings as well. This study assessed the long-term risk of developing disordered eating among children with overweight and obesity and their siblings as well as the change in the obesogenic environment following a family-based intervention program. Methods: In a 30-month retrospective follow-up study (n = 18 families in intervention group, n = 26 families in control group, total of 81 children and siblings) and a 14-month prospective follow-up study (n = 42 families, 78 children and siblings), families with one or more children with overweight or obesity ages 8-14 years participated in a multidisciplinary parent-child program called ""Maccabi Active"". Children's version of the eating-attitude-test (ChEAT) questionnaire, family eating-and-activity-habits questionnaire (FEAHQ) and BMI z-score were measured. Results: in the retrospective study, no difference between groups with respect to ChEAT scores in children and siblings was found. In the prospective study, the FEAHQ score significantly decreased after completion of the program (Delta FEAHQ = -16.2 +/- 4.9, p = 0.001) and continued to decrease in the 8-month follow-up (Delta FEAHQ = -23.2 +/- 5.7, p = 0.001). BMI z-scores decreased after 6 months (Delta BMI z-score = -0.3 +/- 0.1, p = 0.014), and did not increase in the 8-month follow-up. Conclusions: Our findings suggest no exacerbation in disordered eating behaviors among children with overweight or obesity or their siblings, thus alleviating concerns surrounding the development of disordered eating after participating in a family-based intervention. Moreover, improvement in obesogenic environment suggests potential benefits to the entire family. (c) 2020 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A novel cooperative game network DEA model for marine circular economy performance evaluation of China,"Ding, LL; Lei, L; Wang, L; Zhang, LF; Calin, AC","This paper proposes a novel cooperative game network DEA model for evaluating marine circular economy (MCE) performance. The proposed model considers the bidirectional link between the economic production (EP) and environmental treatment (ET) subsystems within the MCE system. Then, the cooperative game strategy between subsystems is modeled by maximizing the factor inefficiency both of subsystems into the model's measurement from a centralized control perspective. The evaluation results of China's regional MCE performances over 2006-2015 show that while most coastal areas have a better efficiency score for the EP system, their performance of the ET system is worse and leads to poor MCE performances. In addition, converge analysis indicates that there exists beta converge of efficiency difference across coastal regions in the long term. Furthermore, the efficiency decomposition reveals that many inefficient environmental treatment inputs contribute to the worse performance of the ET system. Based on the above findings, several specific policy implications for the existing problems are provided to promote China's MCE. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A multi-parameter in-situ water quality analyzer based on a portable document scanner and 3D printed self-sampling cells,"Lin, BC; Xu, J; Yu, C; Chen, LD; Lu, M; Xie, X","This research introduced a new low-cost and multi-parameter analyzer for in-situ measurements of typical nutrients in water bodies. The analyzer consisted of color detection and chromogenic reaction modules. The self-sampling action of the 3D printed sampling/reaction cells was achieved with the cooperative application of rubber bands and dissolvable thread. The target analytes in the collected water sample reacted with the chromogenic reagents that were diffused from the pre-placed glass wool in the cell, producing color compounds. A portable document scanner was employed as a multi-parameter in-situ detector to record the image of the colored solutions in all five cells simultaneously. Based on the image, the corrected grayscale values were derived for target analyte quantitation.The relationships between grayscale values and concentrations of target analytes were established, and the temperature effects were studied. In addition, the practicability of the analyzer was demonstrated by in-situ experiments carried out in four different sites, including a creek, a river dock, a reservoir and a secondary settling tank in a wastewater treatment facility. The results indicated that the analyzer could be used for in-situ measuring of nutrients at mu mol/L levels in the water. The nutrient concentrations obtained with the analyzer were comparable with those obtained with the standard methods. The presented analyzer provided new complementary ideas and methods for in-situ rapid measurement of nutrients and other target analytes in various water systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Rationale and protocol for a randomized controlled trial comparing daily calorie restriction versus intermittent fasting to improve glycaemia in individuals at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes,"Teong, XT; Liu, K; Hutchison, AT; Liu, B; Feinle-Bisset, C; Wittert, GA; Lange, K; Vincent, AD; Heilbronn, LK","Background: Intermittent fasting (IF) is proposed as a viable alternative to moderate calorie restriction (CR) for weight loss and metabolic health, but few long term randomized trials have been conducted. This protocol paper describes the rationale and detailed protocol for DIRECT study (Daily versus Intermittent Restriction of Energy: Controlled Trial to Reduce Diabetes Risk), comparing long term effectiveness of IF versus CR on metabolic health in individuals who are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Methods: Anticipated 260 non-diabetic men and women aged 35-75 years, BMI 25-50 kg/m(2) with score >= 12 on the Australian Diabetes Risk (AUSDRISK) calculator will be recruited into this open-label, multi-arm, parallel group sequential randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to one of three groups for 18 months: IF (30% of energy needs on fast days), CR (70% of energy needs daily), or standard care (SC) group. All participants will visit the clinic fortnightly for weight assessments during active intervention phase (6 months), followed by a 12-month follow-up phase. IF and CR groups will receive further diet counselling by dietitian. Two primary outcomes are the changes in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and postprandial glucose area under the curve (AUC) at week 24 post-randomization. Secondary outcomes include changes in weight, body composition via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, gastro-intestinal hormones, cardiovascular risk factors, and dietary record by a smartphone-based application.Discussion: This study will provide substantial evidence as to whether IF is an effective nutrition intervention for glycaemic control in a population at risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Socio-ecological vulnerability to tipping points: A review of empirical approaches and their use for marine management,"Lauerburg, RAM; Diekmann, R; Blanz, B; Gee, K; Held, H; Kannen, A; Mollmann, C; Probst, WN; Rambo, H; Cormier, R; Stelzenmuller, V","Sustainability in the provision of ecosystem services requires understanding of the vulnerability of socialecological systems (SES) to tipping points (TPs). Assessing SES vulnerability to abrupt ecosystem state changes remains challenging, however, because frameworks do not operationally link ecological, socio-economic and cultural elements of the SES. We conducted a targeted literature review on empirical assessments of SES and TPs in the marine realm and their use in ecosystem-based management. Our results revealed a plurality of terminologies, definitions and concepts that hampers practical operationalisation of these concepts. Furthermore, we found a striking lack of socio-cultural aspects in SES vulnerability assessments, possibly because of a lack of involvement of stakeholders and interest groups. We propose guiding principles for assessing vulnerability to TPs that build on participative approaches and prioritise the connectivity between SES components by accounting for component linkages, cascading effects and feedback processes.

Spatio-temporal analysis of leptospirosis incidence and its relationship with hydroclimatic indicators in northeastern Argentina,"Lopez, MS; Muller, GV; Lovino, MA; Gomez, AA; Sione, WF; Pomares, LA","Leptospirosis is considered the most globally widespread zoonotic illness; it has been classified as an emerging or reemerging infectious disease by the World Health Organization. Leptospirosis is a disease caused by a pathogenic spirochete of the genus Leptospira. The infection occurs by contacting with the urine of animal reservoirs or contaminated environments. Leptospirosis can be controlled by vaccines used mainly in animals, antibiotics given to exposed humans, and flood-affected people moved to a safe place. Northeastern Argentina accounts for the highest annual number of cases and deaths due to leptospirosis of the country. This interdisciplinary study aims to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of leptospirosis, and assesses the hydroclimatic factors that give rise to the outbreaks in northeastern Argentina. The main goal is to detect the hydroclimatic indicators that can influence leptospirosis outbreaks occurrence in the northeastern Argentina. We performa spatio-temporal analysis of the leptospirosis in the provinces of Santa Fe and Entre Rios to distinguish the regions, years and seasons with the highest incidence of this disease. This study analyzes confirmed cases of leptospirosis between 2009 and 2018 years. Hydroclimatic indicators (monthly total precipitation, monthly river hydrometric level and Oceanic Nino Index) associated with outbreaks of leptospirosis vary in different spatial scales (provincial, departmental and cities). In the last outbreak of leptospirosis in 2015-2016 the number of cases was lower than expected. This could have been a consequence of increased prophylaxis in that flood event. Therefore, this is a variable that should be incorporated in future studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

"Using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope modelling to assess dietary mercury exposure for pregnant women in Baja California Sur, Mexico","Harley, J; Gaxiola-Robles, R; Zenteno-Savin, T; Mendez-Rodriguez, LC; Bencomo-Alvarez, AE; Thiede, A; O'Hara, TM","Introduction: Previous studies of mercury (Hg) in pregnant women in the area of La Paz, Baja California Sur (BCS), Mexico found a proportion of individuals had concentrations of total Hg ([THg]) above some thresholds of concern set by health agencies. The [THg] were associated with fish and seafood consumption as well as other factors; although it was unclear which marine diet items could potentially be contributing to the concentrations observed.Method: We examined [THg] and monomethyl mercury concentration ([MeHg+]) in the archived hair of 70 pregnant women from BCS as well as in diet items including fish, shellfish, and staple items (rice, beans, corn, and flour). We measured stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen and employed a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model to investigate the proportion of fish and seafood in the isotopic profiles of archived hair samples.Results: Concentrations of Hg species were low in staple foods and ranged from below detection limit to 5.71 parts per billion (ppb) wet weight. In hair, geometric mean [THg] was 658 ppb and [MeHg+] was 395 ppb, which were lower than previous reports. Percent MeHg+ was positively correlated with higher delta N-15 values.Conclusions: The largest carbon contributors to the diet of the study participants were corn and rice, and our analysis of fish contribution to diet varyingly agreed with the self-reported fish consumption. This report highlights the ability to discriminate potential sources of Hg from a diverse diet and the limitations of dietary recall studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Use of 95% confidence intervals in the reporting of between-group differences in randomized controlled trials: analysis of a representative sample of 200 physical therapy trials,"Freire, APCF; Elkinsb, MR; Ramos, EMC; Moseley, AM","Objectives: To assess the prevalence of the use of 95% confidence intervals in the reporting of between-group differences in randomized controlled trials of physical therapy interventions and to determine if the prevalence is changing over time.Methods: Observational study, including an analysis of 200 trials from the Physiotherapy Evidence Database: 50 from each of the years 1986, 1996, 2006, and 2016. The primary outcome used was the prevalence of the between-group difference presented with 95% confidence intervals. We also extracted trial characteristics for descriptive purposes (i.e., number of participants, number of sites involved in recruitment, country(ies) of data collection, funding, subdiscipline of physical therapy, publication language and total Physiotherapy Evidence Database score).Results: Most commonly, the trials were published in English (89%) and classified in the musculoskeletal subdiscipline (23%). The overall prevalence of use of confidence intervals was 29% and there was a consistent increase in reporting between 1986 and 2016, with peak usage in the 2016 cohort (42%). Confidence intervals were more likely to be used in trials that had received funding, were conducted in Europe and Oceania, and in trials with a Physiotherapy Evidence Database score of at least 6/10.Conclusions: Most trials of physical therapy interventions do not report confidence intervals around between-group differences. However, use of confidence intervals is increasing steadily, especially among high-quality trials. Physical therapists must understand confidence intervals so that they can understand a growing number of trials in physical therapy.

Ecotoxicological impact of selected polyethylenimines toward their potential application as nitrogen fertilizers with prolonged activity,"Rychter, P; Christova, D; Lewicka, K; Rogacz, D","Poly(2-oxazoline) polymers have found extensive application in the preparation of microcapsules for biomedical purposes. However, there is a scarcity of information related to their ecotoxicological assessment. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the ecotoxicity of selected polyethylenimines (PEIs) including poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx) as an N-acyl-substituted PEI, linear polyethylenimine (LPEI) and branched polyethylenimine (BPEI). Oat (a monocotyledon) (Avena sativa) and radish (a dicotyledon) (Raphanus sativus) were selected as the representative plants, which are recommended by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 208 as the standard to test for plant growth. Shoot and root length, fresh and dry matter, level of total nitrogen in green parts of the plants, as well as total chlorophyll and carotenoids were determined. Phytotoxicity of all the tested parameters was dependent on the concentration of the examined polymers in the soil as well as on the time of their incubation in the soil. According to our results, the amount of nitrogen in green parts of the plants was increased compared to the control plants, which revealed the uptake of the plant-available form of nitrogen released from the tested PEIs. This was especially true for the plants treated with LPEI. Ecotoxicological impact of the incubated polymers in the soil against marine bacteria Allivibrio fischeri proved that, the all tested polyethylenimines may be classified as not harmful to aquatic microorganisms.

Potential Benefits of Vessel Slowdowns on Endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales,"Joy, R; Tollit, D; Wood, J; MacGillivray, A; Li, ZZ; Trounce, K; Robinson, O","A voluntary commercial vessel slowdown trial was conducted through 16 nm of shipping lanes overlapping critical habitat of at-risk southern resident killer whales (SRKVV) in the Salish Sea. From August 7 to October 6, 2017, the trial requested piloted vessels to slow to 11 knots speed-through-water. Analysis of AIS vessel tracking data showed that 350 of 951 (37%) piloted transits achieved this target speed, 421 of 951 (44%) transits achieved speeds within one knot of this target (i.e., <= 12 knots), and 55% achieved speeds <= 13 knots. Slowdown results were compared to 'Baseline' noise of the same region, matched across lunar months. A local hydrophone listening station in Lime Kiln State Park, 2.3 km from the shipping lane, recorded 1.2 dB reductions in median broadband noise (10-100,000 Hz, rms) compared to the Baseline period, despite longer transit. The median reduction was 2.5 dB when filtering only for periods when commercial vessels were within 6 km radius of Lime Kiln. The reductions were highest in the 1st decade band (-3.1 dB, 10-100 Hz) and lowest in the 4th decade band (-0.3 dB reduction, 10-100 kHz). A regional vessel noise model predicted noise for a range of traffic volume and vessel speed scenarios for a 1133 km(2) 'Slowdown region' containing the 16 nm of shipping lanes. A temporally and spatially explicit simulation model evaluated the changes in traffic volume and speed on SRKW in their foraging habitat within this Slowdown region. The model tracked the number and magnitude of noise-exposure events that impacted each of 78 (simulated) SRKW across different traffic scenarios. These disturbance metrics were simplified to a cumulative effect termed 'potential lost foraging time' that corresponded to the sum of disturbance events described by assumptions of time that whales could not forage due to noise disturbance. The model predicted that the voluntary Slowdown trial achieved 22% reduction in 'potential lost foraging time' for SRKW, with 40% reductions under 100% 11-knot participation. Slower vessel speeds reduced underwater noise in the Slowdown area despite longer passage times and therefore suggest this is an effective way to benefit SRKW habitat function in the vicinity of shipping lanes.",2019,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,6,,,WOS:000473481800003,10.3389/fmars.2019.00344,,#20073,Joy 2019,,
"Standardized questions in English for estimating tinnitus prevalence and severity, hearing difficulty and usage of healthcare resources, and their translation into 11 European languages","Biswas, R; Lugo, A; Gallus, S; Akeroyd, MA; Hall, DA","Introduction: Prevalence estimates depend largely on the nature of the question asked to define the presence of the health condition, and the literature on the population burden of tinnitus and hearing difficulties is no different in this respect. The lack of standardized questions for data collection limits comparison across studies and across countries. The purpose of this short Technical Note is to report the first attempt to establish a set of standard questions developed for use in population-based surveys, and their adaptation and translation from English into 11 European languages.Methods: Four questions and their corresponding response options were adapted from existing population-based surveys to assess tinnitus prevalence, tinnitus symptom severity, use of healthcare resources for tinnitus and hearing difficulty. The translated versions (Bulgarian, French, German, Greek, Italian, Latvian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish) were generated using recognized methods to achieve a ""world-for-world"" translation.Results: Translated versions were produced with acceptable functional equivalence to the original English-language version, as judged by a small panel of bilingual speakers who participated in the online field testing.Conclusion: This work is the first of its kind to promote multi-national standardization by creating a set of tools that can readily be used across countries. These are currently being used in a European-wide study of tinnitus prevalence, and have wider application across English- and Spanish speaking countries including the Americas and Oceania.

The review included a total of 58 papers, which describe original investigations on healthy adolescents (10-19 years old) living in North America, Europe or Oceania, with a sample size >150 participants. The average fruit and vegetable consumption has been found strongly below the recommended values of 400 grams or 5 portions per day in almost all the examined populations. Very little is known about adolescents' legume consumption. Few available data have been found also for sodium intake and, for the majority of the screened populations, levels were far above the recommended 5 grams per day. Lastly, a medium-low adherence to the Mediterranean Diet has been found for adolescents living in Mediterranean Countries.Conclusions: Adolescents living in North America, Europe or Oceania are far from being compliant with the nutritional recommendations for fruit, vegetables, legumes, and sodium, and they do not follow the principles of the Mediterranean Diet. Educational and behavioural interventions are required to improve adolescents' dietary patterns.

"Polyunsaturated fatty acids intake, omega-6/omega-3 ratio and mortality: Findings from two independent nationwide cohorts","Zhuang, P; Wang, WQ; Wang, J; Zhang, Y; Jiao, JJ","Background & aims: Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been reported to exert pleiotropic protective effects against various chronic diseases. However, epidemiologic evidence linking specific PUFA intake to mortality has been limited and contradictory. We aim to assess the associations between specific dietary PUFA and mortality among adults in China and America, respectively.Methods: Participants from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS, n = 14,117) and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES (n = 36,032)] were prospectively followed up through the year 2011. Cox regression models were used to investigate hypothesized associations.Results: A total of 1007 and 4826 deaths accrued over a median of 14 and 9.1 years of follow-up in CHNS and NHANES, respectively. Dietary marine omega-3 PUFA was robustly associated with a reduced all-cause mortality [Hazard ratio (HR) comparing extreme categories: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.61-0.89; P < 0.001 for trend] in CHNS. Nevertheless, this inverse relationship was not observed in NHANES. The overall mortality was positively associated with the intake of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (HR comparing extreme quartiles: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.01-1.50; P = 0.054 for trend) in CHNS, whereas weak inverse associations of ALA (P = 0.035 for trend) and LA (P = 0.027 for trend) with all-cause mortality were found in NHANES. Increased dietary intake of arachidonic acid was consistently linked with reduced all-cause mortality both in NHANES and CHNS. Importantly, consuming PUFA at an omega-6/omega-3 ratio of 6-10 was associated with a lower risk of death in CHNS.Conclusions: Intakes of different specific PUFA show distinct associations with mortality and these relationships also vary between Chinese and US populations. These findings suggest maintaining an omega-6/omega-3 balance diet for overall health promotion outcomes (NCT03155659).

Urban blue: A global analysis of the factors shaping people's perceptions of the marine environment and ecological engineering in harbours,"Strain, EMA; Alexander, KA; Kienker, S; Morris, R; Jarvis, R; Coleman, R; Bollard, B; Firth, LB; Knights, AM; Grabowski, JH; Airoldi, L; Chan, BKK; Chee, SY; Cheng, Z; Coutinho, R; de Menezes, RG; Ding, M; Dong, Y; Fraser, CML; Gomez, AG; Juanes, JA; Mancuso, P; Messano, LVR; Naval-Xavier, LPD; Scyphers, S; Steinberg, P; Swearer, S; Valdor, PF; Wong, JXY; Yee, J; Bishop, MJ","Marine harbours are the focus of a diverse range of activities and subject to multiple anthropogenically induced pressures. Support for environmental management options aimed at improving degraded harbours depends on understanding the factors which influence people's perceptions of harbour environments. We used an online survey, across 12 harbours, to assess sources of variation people's perceptions of harbour health and ecological engineering. We tested the hypotheses: 1) people living near impacted harbours would consider their environment to be more unhealthy and degraded, be more concerned about the environment and supportive of and willing to pay for ecological engineering relative to those living by less impacted harbours, and 2) people with greater connectedness to the harbour would be more concerned about and have greater perceived knowledge of the environment, and be more supportive of, knowledgeable about and willing to pay for ecological engineering, than those with less connectedness. Across twelve locations, the levels of degradation and modification by artificial structures were lower and the concern and knowledge about the environment and ecological engineering were greater in the six Australasian and American than the six European and Asian harbours surveyed. We found that people's perception of harbours as healthy or degraded, but not their concern for the environment, reflected the degree to which harbours were impacted. There was a positive relationship between the percentage of shoreline modified and the extent of support for and people's willingness to pay indirect costs for ecological engineering. At the individual level, measures of connectedness to the harbour environment were good predictors of concern for and perceived knowledge about the environment but not support for and perceived knowledge about ecological engineering. To make informed decisions, it is important that people are empowered with sufficient knowledge of the environmental issues facing their harbour and ecological engineering options.

The potential of models and modeling for social-ecological systems research: the reference frame ModSES,"Schluter, M; Muller, B; Frank, K","Dynamic models have long been a common tool to support management of ecological and economic systems and played a prominent role in the early days of resilience research. Model applications have largely focused on policy assessment, the development of optimal management strategies, or analysis of system stability. However, modeling can serve many other purposes such as understanding system responses that emerge from complex interactions of system components, supporting participatory processes, and analyzing consequences of human behavioral complexity. The diversity of purposes, types, and applications of models offers great potential for social-ecological systems (SESs) research, but has created much confusion because modeling approaches originate from different disciplines, are based on different assumptions, focus on different levels of analysis, and use different analytical methods. This diversity makes it difficult to identify which approach is most suitable for addressing a specific question. Here, our aims are: (1) to introduce the most common types of dynamic models used in SESs research and related fields, and (2) to align these models with SESs research aims to support the selection and communication of the most suitable approach for a given study. To this end, we organize modeling approaches into a reference scheme called ""modelling for social-ecological systems research"" (ModSES) along two dimensions: the degree of realism and the degree of knowledge integration. These two dimensions capture key challenges of SESs research related to the need to account for context dependence and the intertwined nature of SESs as systems of humans embedded in nature across multiple scales, as well as to acknowledge different problem framings, understandings, interests, and values. We highlight the need to be aware of the potentials, limitations, and conceptual backgrounds underlying the different approaches. Critical engagement with modeling for different aims of SESs research can contribute to developing integrative understanding and action toward enhanced resilience and sustainability.",2019,,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,24,1,,WOS:000464153200024,10.5751/ES-10716-240131,,#20079,Schluter 2019,,

Additionally, 40.2% of women with BMI >= 26 kg/m(2) using oral LNG EC reported having a doctor or medical provider talk to them about emergency contraception within the last 12 months, compared to 18.3% of LNG EC users with BMI < 26 kg/m(2) (p < 0.001).Conclusions: Despite recent counseling from clinicians and concerns for decreased efficacy, a significant number of overweight women continue to use LNG for EC. Clinicians should counsel women with BMI >= 26 kg/m(2) on the potential limitations of oral LNG for EC and offer more effective EC methods, including the copper intrauterine device and oral ulipristal acetate.

Numerical calculations of environmental impacts for deep sea mining activities,"Ma, WB; Schott, D; van Rhee, C","With the expected dramatic increase of mineral resources consumption, deep sea mining (DSM) was proposed as a method supplying the running of world economy by cooperating with or compensating for the terrestrial mining industry. However, its industrialization process is hindered by various reasons including the technological feasibility, economic profitability, and the DSM environmental impacts. The objective of this paper is to calculate the DSM environmental impacts based on a DSM environmental impact framework, which was selected through a systematic literature review in earlier work. The numerical calculations focus on the initial DSM disturbances and plume source, species disturbance, sediment plume and tailings. More importantly, the interconnection between the sediment plume and the species disturbances is also analysed particularly in this paper. The research quantifies the environmental impacts into a systematic framework, which could be helpful to assess the comprehensive environmental performances of a DSM activity and to promote the DSM industrialization process in the future.

Are Some Natural Environments More Psychologically Beneficial Than Others? The Importance of Type and Quality on Connectedness to Nature and Psychological Restoration,"Wyles, KJ; White, MP; Hattam, C; Pahl, S; King, H; Austen, M","Exposure to nature can strengthen an individual's sense of connectedness (i.e., emotional/cognitive bonds to the natural world) and enhance psychological restoration (e.g., feeling relaxed/refreshed). To date, there have been few large studies looking at the role that type and quality of natural environments may have on these outcomes. The present study used data from a large survey in England (sample analyzed = 4,515), which asked participants to recall a recent visit to nature. After controlling for covariates, respondents recalled greater connectedness to nature and restoration following visits to rural and coastal locations compared with urban green space, and to sites of higher environmental quality (operationalized by protected/designated area status, for example, nature reserves). A series of structural equation analyses provided evidence for a bidirectional association between connectedness and restoration.

Assessing research trends related to Sustainable Development Goals: local and global issues,"Salvia, AL; Leal, W; Brandli, LL; Griebeler, JS","The Sustainable Development Goals agreed by the United Nations in September 2015 comprise 17 goals and 169 targets aimed at integrating matters related to sustainable development into the overall economic, environmental and social frameworks of countries. Whereas the SDGs have a global dimension, their action implementation depends on the level of priority different countries give to them, and on how sustainability issues compete with a country's main problems. The aim of this paper was to identify the main Sustainable Development Goals approached by experts from different geographic regions, according to their experience and research area, and to discuss the relation between these goals and the main local issues and challenges of each region. The methodology starts with snowball sampling to collect information from experts from all geographic regions, through contact networks of universities in different countries. With the information about the goals researched by the participating experts, an analysis of the relation between the study focus and the geographical regions of origin was conducted. A total of 266 specialists from North America, Latin America/Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Europe and Oceania participated in the survey. Based on the sample used, it can be said that there is a relation between the local problems or challenges observed in some regions and the main areas of interest of the surveyed experts, with a general emphasis on the study of goals 4,11 and 13. Based on the data gathered, the paper presents a set of examples of positive and negative situations in the various regions, and considers the extent to which some Sustainable Development Goals are being pursued by research on a worldwide basis.

Delphi-based prioritization of economic criteria for development of wave and tidal energy technologies,"Jahanshahi, A; Karnali, M; Khalaj, M; Khodaparast, Z","Harness of wave and tidal energies can play an important role in the future energy portfolios to ensure the energy security and to reach the low-carbon energy development plans. However, despite the existence of adequate resources of these energies through the world, they have not been well exploited yet. This study has focused on the assessment of the economic criteria and their relative importance for the development of the wave and tidal energy technologies based on the experts' judgment. To this end, the expert elicitation process was performed using the Delphi methodology. 5 main criteria and 29 sub-criteria were initially identified through a comprehensive literature review. During two rounds of Delphi questionnaires, the degree of importance and the degree of consensus values were identified for each individual parameter. According to the results achieved, selling the energy produced and tax incentives were rated as the most important factors with the highest degrees of consensus. While quotas and tenders were not identified by the experts participated in the survey with high importance on the development of wave and tidal energies although with low degrees of consensus.

Beach environmental etiquette: Assessing public awareness of marine reserves on the central coast of California,"Moritsch, M; Strope, L; Crandall, SG","For protected areas to achieve their conservation goals, visitors should be aware of reserve boundaries and follow the protective measures within them. However, lack of knowledge about the specifics of reserve geography and rules can lead to actions that adversely affect marine life (unsanctioned fishing and collecting) or disturb sensitive species within these areas, even when general support for protected areas is high. We assessed public awareness of State Marine Reserves locations and policies on the central California coast. Using surveys in the form of semi-structured interviews and written questionnaires, we asked beach visitors whether they had prior knowledge about State Marine Reserves. We provided half of participants with new knowledge about State Marine Reserves in the form of a verbal, short pre-survey speech. We asked participants to indicate if they were currently standing inside of a State Marine Reserve and assessed their self-reported likelihoods of performing several actions related to environmental etiquette such as following reserve rules. Finally, we tested how provisional new knowledge influences perceptions surrounding the importance of protecting marine habitats and human impacts on them. Overall, 60% of participants had heard of marine reserves, though this varied by participant region of residence. 33% of participants with prior knowledge and 13% of participants with no prior knowledge identified site protection status correctly. Over half of participants self-reported behaviors consistent with reserve rules and environmental etiquette. Survey participants who received new knowledge did not differ from the control group in their ability to correctly identify reserve location or in their perceptions of human impacts. Our results suggest that the information in our short verbal speech was not sufficient for changing perceptions, though over 90% of visitors stated marine protection to was already personally important or very important to them. Beach visitors intend to treat reserves well if they know they are visiting a reserve. However, because less than one third of visitors recognize reserve locations, a disconnect exists between understanding acceptable behavior for protected sites and knowing where to apply this behavior. Finally, we discuss the educational strategies of docent presence and place-based learning opportunities to improve awareness of marine reserves and their locations for local and non-local visitors.",2019,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,167,,104-114,WOS:000453113900011,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.10.005,,#20086,Moritsch 2019,,

Mineral resources base investigation and research status of the Tibet Plateau and its adjacent major metallogenic belts,"Tang, JX","The four metallogenic belts in Tibet were the products of the long evolutionary progress of the Tethyan Ocean. A series discoveries of super-giant high grade copper-gold deposits belts make the belt not only one of the most important resource reserves, but also the resource security base of China. However, due to the harsh work environment and the lack of research work, many key geological questions remain unsolved. In particular, the geological survey and mineral exploration of the Bangong Co-Nujiang Metallogenic Belt, which is called ""the roof of the world ridge"", has been seriously restricted. Aim at the above questions, the Institute of Mineral Resources, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, in cooperation with 12 universities, institutes, geological exploration units and industries on the focus of ""multi-levels from exploitation to research, and to application"", by taking the 1 : 50000 geological survey and integrated study as methods, and aimed to solve the key scientific problems that restrict the breakthrough of prospecting, and achieved a series of significant outcomes as follows: (1) The advanced understandings of the Late Triassic-Early Cretaceous stage evolution of the Tethyan Ocean, based on comprehensively studies of tectonics, sedimentation and magmatic coupling process in the Central Tibetan Plateau that will aid to the future prospecting breakthrough.

Mechanisms of stress-related muscle atrophy in fish: An ex vivo approach,"Torres-Velarde, J; Llera-Herrera, R; Garcia-Gasca, T; Garcia-Gasca, A","Muscle development involves coordinated molecular events leading to cell proliferation, fusion, differentiation, sarcomere assembly, and myofibrogenesis. However, under physiological or pathological stress, energy requirements and secretion of glucocorticoids increase, resulting in muscle atrophy because of the depletion of energy reserves. Glucocorticoids induce muscular atrophy by two main mechanisms, protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and inhibition of protein synthesis through the negative regulation of the IGF1-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Other signaling pathways (such as the myostatin-activin-smad pathway) involved in muscle atrophy by glucocorticoid exposure are unclear. In fish, the role of glucocorticoids in muscle atrophy has not been fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the mechanisms of muscle atrophy induced by a synthetic glucocorticoid (dexamethasone, DEX) in an ex vivo muscle culture system of a marine fish (Lutjanus guttatus). Results showed that DEX was able to induce the expression of myostatin-1, and the expression of the transcription factor foxo3b. Myostatin-1 silencing by RNAi produced a decrease in the expression of foxo3b and murf1, and increased the expression of mtor, myod-2 and myogenin. These results suggest that in fish skeletal muscle, myostatin-1 signaling participates in glucocorticoid-induced muscle wasting through the negative regulation of genes involved in muscle growth, such as mtor, myod-2 and myogenin, and the induction of atrophy genes like foxo3b and murf1.",2018,,MECHANISMS OF DEVELOPMENT,154,,162-169,WOS:000452559000019,10.1016/j.mod.2018.07.002,,#20089,Torres-Velarde 2018,,
Unsupervised pixel-wise classification for Chaetoceros image segmentation,"Tang, N; Zhou, F; Gu, ZR; Zheng, HY; Yu, ZB; Zheng, B","Chaetoceros is a dominant genus of marine planktonic diatoms with worldwide distribution. Due to the difficulty of extracting setae from Chaetoceros images, automatic segmentation of Chaetoceros is still a challenging task. In this paper, we address this difficult task by regarding the whole segmentation process as unsupervised pixel-wise classification without human participation. First, we automatically produce positive (object) and negative (background) samples for follow-up training, by combining the advantages of two image processing algorithms: Grayscale Surface Direction Angle Model (GSDAM) for extracting setae information and Canny for detecting cell edges from low-contrast and strong-noisy microscopic images. Second, we develop pixel-wise training by using the produced samples in the training process of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). At last, the trained DCNN is used to label other pixels into object and background for final segmentation. We compare our method with eight mainstream segmentation approaches: Otsu's thresholding, Canny, Watershed, Mean Shift, gPb-owt-ucm, Normalized Cut, Efficient Graph-based method and GSDAM. To objectively evaluate segmentation results, we apply six well-known evaluation indexes. Experimental results on a new Chaetoceros image dataset with human labelled ground truth show that our method outperforms the eight mainstream segmentation methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

The roles interpretative programmes in supporting the sustainable operation of the nature-based activities,"Cheng, INY; Cheung, LTO; Chow, ASY; Fok, L; Cheang, CC","This study assesses the role of interpretative dolphin-watching activities in enhancing participants' ecological knowledge, environmentally responsible behaviour intention, revisit intention and satisfaction with the experience. An on-site questionnaire survey was administered to participants of both an interpretative (experimental) and a noninterpretative (control) dolphin-watching group. The survey results revealed that participants who joined the interpretative dolphin-watching activities exhibited significantly better ecological knowledge, environmentally responsible behaviour intention, satisfaction and revisit intention than their counterparts. In addition, a regression test indicated a significant association between ecological knowledge and environmentally responsible behaviour intention as well as satisfaction and revisit intention. The findings highlighted the importance of interpretative programmes for nature-based activities, suggesting that the relevant service providers and managers of protected areas should implement such programmes to attract visitors and improve the environmental performance of the activities to achieve sustainability. The interpretative programme can also be an effective tool for environmental education to enhance the environmental conservation awareness of both tourists and local residents to nurture environmentally aware citizens.

Abnormal of inter-hemispheric functional connectivity in elderly subjects with overweight/obesity,"ADNI; Luo, X; Li, KC; Jia, YL; Zeng, QZ; Jiaerken, Y; Qiu, TT; Huang, PY; Xu, XJ; Zhang, MM","Background: There is a growing literature documenting a variety of brain abnormalities associated with obesity. However, little is known about the effects of obesity on inter-hemispheric connectivity in aging people.Methods: Participants included 61 cognitively intact elderly (including people with obesity, overweight, and lean controls) who underwent structural MRI, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and standard neuropsychological batteries. Techniques including FreeSurfer and Voxel-mirrored Homotopic Connectivity (VMHC) were employed to evaluate inter-hemispheric structural and functional connectivity respectively.Results: There were no differences of cognitive abilities and vascular risks among groups. When compared to lean controls, obese group had greater VMHC in fusiform gyrus (FG); while overweight group had greater VMHC in FG, calcarine gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and postcentral gyrus (PCG). Moreover, the obesity group had lower VMHC in calcarine gyrus and PCG than overweight group (p < 0.05, corrected).Conclusions: The present study suggested, increased inter-hemispheric information transmission in networks supporting visual and sensorimotor function may lead to gain in weight, by possibly mediating diet behaviours of individuals.

From the forest to the coast: co-management instruments and the institutional legacy of Extractive Reserves,"Prado, DS; Seixas, CS","Several authors have made elucidative contributions on the evolution of extractive reserves (Resex), from their original conception to their institutionalization as an environmental policy. Part of this literature points out transformations on the institutional arrangements, when they are formalized and recognized by the State. This article presents the co-management instruments of Brazilian Marine Extractive Reserves and an analysis of their formal arrangements evolution, based on secondary data and an assessment of pertinent legislation since the first Resex decree. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 managers of Coastal and Marine Resex. The interviews aimed to identify all co-management instruments used in each Resex, their stage of implementation as well as the managers' perception on these instruments. We consider co-management instruments as formal arrangements that require participatory procedures or that act as arenas for decision-making. The results show that the legacy of the rubber tappers social movement in 80's, which created an inclusive model of protected area, is presented in the formal arrangements established over time. The instruments for co-management are divided into instruments of territorial recognition and beneficiaries, instruments for land use planning, arenas for discussion and deliberation, as well as public policies for Resex. This institutional framework has become increasingly robust over time, although it still needs to be improved. Part of the challenges include a reduction on bureaucratic procedures for the formal recognition of these instruments and the technocratic logic of the State that is often exercising tutelage rather than social emancipation of traditional people.",2018,,DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE,48,,281-298,WOS:000454644400014,10.5380/dma.v48i0.58759,,#20093,Prado 2018,,
Design and simulations of refrigerated sea water chillers with CO2 ejector pumps for marine applications in hot climates,"Bodys, J; Hafner, A; Banasiak, K; Smolka, J; Ladam, Y","Various system configurations have been developed to improve the R744 systems under hot ambient conditions. However, stationary land applications are characterised by negligible limits on space for system equipment, unlike the marine industry, i.e. on-board fishing vessels. The baseline CO2 refrigeration system for fishing vessels was developed by a cooperating industrial company, namely the Refrigerated Sea Water Chillers operation on the Norwegian coast, which confirmed the successful application of this approach. In this study, modified layouts are evaluated for operation in warmer climates without the need for an additional compressor unit, thus maintaining the compactness of the unit. Flash gas valve-, parallel compression- and multi-ejector systems were numerically investigated including ejectors section and flooded evaporator. Sea water temperatures as occurring in Mediterranean and East-Asian waters were investigated. Both the optimal high-pressure as well as the pressure level in an intermediate pressure receiver were controlled to achieve low energy consumptions. Finally, an up to 70% performance improvement was obtained in the case of the most advanced installation working in warm East-Asian waters. The obtained results showed that the proper design of the system should ensure no necessity for an additional compressor in warmer climates while still maintaining the designed cooling capacity.

Comparison of a Patient-Centered Weight Loss Program starting before versus after knee replacement: A pilot study,"Pellegrini, CA; Chang, RW; Dunlop, DD; Conroy, DE; Lee, J; Van Horn, L; Spring, B; Cameron, KA","Background: Most patients risk gaining weight in the years after knee replacement, adding further concern to a population that is mostly overweight/obese prior to surgery.Objective: Via a randomised pilot study, we assessed changes in weight during a Patient Centered Weight Loss Program (PACE) initiated either before or after knee replacement, while simultaneously examining the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants over 26 weeks.Methods: Recruitment outreach was made to 133 patients scheduled for knee replacement. Sixteen participants were randomised to a 14-session weight loss program that started either <6 weeks before surgery (PACE) or at 12 weeks post-op (Delayed PACE). Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to examine preliminary changes in weight, function, patient-reported outcomes, and physical activity across time (baseline/pre-op, 12 and 26 weeks after surgery) and group.Results: Retention was 75% and 69% at 12 and 26 weeks after surgery, respectively. Weight significantly decreased across the 26 weeks (P< 0.001). A group by time interaction (A= 0.03) demonstrated Delayed PACE [-7.6 +/- 5.9 kg (-7.9 +/- 5.9%)] lost significantly more weight than PACE [-2.5 +/- 2.7 kg (-2.6 +/- 2.6%)] participants at 26 weeks. Significant improvements across time were seen for all function and patient reported outcomes, however activity did not change.Conclusion: Conducting a behavioural intervention was challenging but feasible in a knee replacement population, with preliminary evidence suggesting that initiating a program 12 weeks after surgery produces greater weight losses at 26 weeks compared to a program starting before knee replacement.

Association of visceral fat area with abdominal skeletal muscle distribution in overweight Japanese adults,"Tanaka, NI; Murakami, H; Ohmori, Y; Aiba, N; Morita, A; Watanabe, S; Miyachi, M","Background: Quantitative evaluation of visceral fat mass and skeletal muscle mass is important for health promotion. Recently, some studies suggested the existence of adipocyte-myocyte negative crosstalk. If so, abdominal skeletal muscles may easily and negatively affected not only by the age but also the visceral fat because age-related reduction in abdominal region is greater compared with limbs.Objective: We cross-sectionally examined the existence of quantitative associations between visceral fat area and abdominal skeletal muscle distribution in overweight people.Methods: A total of 230 Japanese males and females who aged 40-64 years and whose body mass index (BMI) was 28.0-44.8 kg/m(2) participated in this study. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the visceral fat, subcutaneous fat, and abdominal skeletal muscles, namely, the rectus abdominis, abdominal oblique, erector spinae, and iliopsoas muscles were measured by the computed tomography images.Results: Stepwise regression analyses revealed the existence of sex difference in the relation between visceral fat CSA and other morphological variables. In males, BMI was a positive, and the iliopsoas muscle group CSA was a negative contributor of the visceral fat CSA. In females, both age and BMI were selected as positive contributors.Conclusion: These data suggested that the visceral fat CSA may negatively associated with iliopsoas muscle group CSA in males. In females, the visceral fat CSA was not significantly related to the distribution of the abdominal skeletal muscle groups. (C) 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

Insight into the endocrine disrupting effect and cell response to butyltin compounds in H295R cell: Evaluated with proteomics and bioinformatics analysis,"Yan, XT; He, B; Hu, LG; Gao, JJ; Chen, S; Jiang, GB","The widespread use of organotin compounds (OTs) as biocides in antifouling paints and agricultural applications poses a serious threat to the ecosystem and humans. Butyltin compounds (BTs), especially tributyltin (TBT), are considered to be endocrine disrupting chemicals in marine organisms. The underlying mechanism of disrupting effects on mammals, however, has not been sufficiently investigated. To determine the effect and action of these biocides, the present study evaluated the effects of BTs on human adrenocortical carcinoma cells (H295R) with a focus on endocrine disrupting effect. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and subsequent mass finger printing were used to identify proteins expression profiles from the cells after exposure to 0.1 mu M BTs for 48 h. In total, 89 protein spots showed altered expression in at least two treatment groups and 69 of these proteins were subsequently identified. Bioinformatic analysis of the proteins indicated that BTs involved in the regulation of hormone homeostasis, lipid metabolism, cell death, and energy production. IPA analysis revealed IXR/RXR (liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor) activation, EXR/RXR (famesoid X receptor/retinoid X receptor) activation and fatty add metabolism were the top three categories on which BTs acted and these systems play vital roles in sterol, glucose and lipid metabolism. The expression of LXR and FXR mRNA in H295R cells was stimulated by TBT, confirming the ability of TBT to activate this nuclear receptor. In summary, the differentially expressed proteins discovered in this study may participate in the toxic actions of BTs, and nuclear receptor activation and lipid metabolism may play important roles in such actions of BTs.

The past holds some unsuccessful experiences. In 2016 Mekong River Commission published IWRM-based Basin Development Strategy 2016-2020 and The Mekong River Commission Strategic Plan 2016-2020. They should be the main guiding document for the Mekong river development in the near future.This study analyzes how the concept of public participation resembles the original IWRM participatory approach in these documents. Therefore, IWRM criteria for public participation in international literature and official documents from the Mekong river basin are compared. As there is often a difference between ""de jure"" and ""de facto"" implementation of public participation in management concepts, the perception of local stakeholders was assessed in addition. The results of social survey give an insight if local people are aware of Mekong river basin development and present their dominant attitudes about the issue. The findings enable recommendations how to mitigate obstacles in the implementation of common development strategy. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Essential coastal habitats for fish in the Baltic Sea,"Kraufvelin, P; Pekcan-Hekim, Z; Bergstrom, U; Florin, AB; Lehikoinen, A; Mattila, J; Arula, T; Briekmane, L; Brown, EJ; Celmer, Z; Dainys, J; Jokinen, H; Kaaria, P; Kallasvuo, M; Lappalainen, A; Lozys, L; Moller, P; Orio, A; Rohtla, M; Saks, L; Snickars, M; Stottrup, J; Sundblad, G; Taal, I; Ustups, D; Verliin, A; Vetemaa, M; Winkler, H; Wozniczka, A; Olsson, J","Many coastal and offshore fish species are highly dependent on specific habitat types for population maintenance. In the Baltic Sea, shallow productive habitats in the coastal zone such as wetlands, vegetated flads/lagoons and sheltered bays as well as more exposed rocky and sandy areas are utilized by fish across many life history stages including spawning, juvenile development, feeding and migration. Although there is general consensus about the critical importance of these essential fish habitats (EFH) for fish production along the coast, direct quantitative evidence for their specific roles in population growth and maintenance is still scarce. Nevertheless, for some coastal species, indirect evidence exists, and in many cases, sufficient data are also available to carry out further quantitative analyses. As coastal EFH in the Baltic Sea are often found in areas that are highly utilized and valued by humans, they are subjected to many different pressures. While cumulative pressures, such as eutrophication, coastal construction and development, climate change, invasive species and fisheries, impact fish in coastal areas, the conservation coverage for EFH in these areas remains poor. This is mainly due to the fact that historically, fisheries management and nature conservation are not integrated neither in research nor in management in Baltic Sea countries. Setting joint objectives for fisheries management and nature conservation would hence be pivotal for improved protection of EFH in the Baltic Sea. To properly inform management, improvements in the development of monitoring strategies and mapping methodology for EFH are also needed. Stronger international cooperation between Baltic Sea states will facilitate improved management outcomes across ecologically arbitrary boundaries. This is especially important for successful implementation of international agreements and legislative directives such as the Baltic Sea Action Plan, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Habitats Directive, and the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, but also for improving the communication of information related to coastal EFH among researchers, stakeholders, managers and decision makers. In this paper, efforts are made to characterize coastal EFH in the Baltic Sea, their importance and the threats/pressures they face, as well as their current conservation status, while highlighting knowledge gaps and outlining perspectives for future work in an ecosystem-based management framework.

Eating alone and metabolic syndrome: A population-based Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013-2014,"Kwon, AR; Yoon, YS; Min, KP; Lee, YK; Jeon, JH","Eating alone has been an emerging social concern in modern life. However, there is little research on the association between eating alone and Metabolic syndrome (MetS).We aimed to assess the association between eating alone and the MetS and to identify whether sociodemographic factors modify this association.This study included 7725 adults (>= 19 years} who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2013-2014. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used for assessing the association of eating alone (none, 1 time/day, and >= 2 times/day) with MetS.The percentages of subjects with MetS were 30.4% in men and 24.2% in women. 20.8% of men and 29.2% of women ate alone >= 2 times/day. Individuals who ate alone 2 or more times per day showed higher frequency of living alone, having no spouse, skip meals, and less eating out (p < 0.05). Women with eating alone >= 2 times/day had a crude OR of 1.29 (95% Cl:1.08-1.53, p-trend = 0.001) for MetS compared with women without eating alone. However, this association was no longer significant after adjustments for confounding factors. Eating alone >= 2 times/day was significantly associated with increase abdominal obesity (OR, 95% Cl: 1.45, 1.10-1.91, p-trend = 0.039) and MetS (1.64, 1.28-2.10, p-trend-0.004) in men. Eating alone was associated with a higher likelihood of having a MetS in men without spouse as compared with those with spouse (OR for men without spouse 3.02, 95% CI: 1.50-6.11 and OR for men with spouse 1.48, 95% CI: 1.22-1.7, p-interaction = 0.027).Our results indicate that eating alone may be a potential risk factor for MetS.

Exclusive breastfeeding and partial breastfeeding reduce the risk of overweight in childhood: A nationwide longitudinal study in Korea,"Park, SJ; Lee, HJ","Objective: Breastfeeding is generally known to reduce the risk of childhood over-weight and obesity. However, the results are controversial between countries, and nationwide data are rare. This study assessed the relationship between breastfeeding types and overweight incidence using nationwide longitudinal data in Korea.Methods: We analysed 774,764 infants who participated in the longitudinal nation-wide data from the Korea National Children's Health Examination 2007-2013. Childhood overweight was defined by a Z-score >= 1.64 (95th centile) for infants under 24 months and Z-scores >= 1.04 (85th centile) for children over 24 months. Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyse the relationship between breastfeeding types and overweight incidence.Results: Infants who were exclusively breastfed at 4-6 months of age had the multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HRs) for overweight of 0.78 (95% CI 0.77-0.79) and infants who were partially breastfed had the HRs for overweight of 0.96 (95% CI 0.94-0.98), which was lower compared to that of the exclusively formula fed group. Similar results were obtained for stratified analysis by boys and girls.Conclusions: Exclusive and partial breastfeeding have preventive effect on childhood overweight in Korea. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage breastfeeding to prevent childhood obesity and its consequences in developed Asian countries. (c) 2018 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

Accounting for outside options in discrete choice models: An application to commercial fishing effort,"Stafford, TM","Discrete choice models often feature a genetic outside option that combines all alternatives other than those of particular interest to the researcher, which allows overall demand for the alternatives of interest to be captured. I demonstrate that combining diverse alternatives into a single outside option can result in distorted parameter estimates and misleading predictions. To evaluate the practical importance of how outside options are treated, I use data on the Florida spiny lobster and stone crab fisheries to compare a discrete choice model that explicitly accounts for individuals' ability to target both species with one that includes stone crab alternatives in the generic outside option. I find that parameter estimates and predictions for the lobster fishery depend heavily upon whether stone crab alternatives are explicitly accounted for. In addition, I conduct a series of Monte Carlo experiments, which demonstrate that the sign and magnitude of differences in predictions between models are complex functions of the characteristics of the empirical environment. Together, these results highlight the importance of carefully considering the composition of outside options when estimating discrete choice models and making predictions based on the estimates.

Evaluating statistical model performance in water quality prediction,"Avila, R; Horn, B; Moriarty, E; Hodson, R; Moltchanova, E","Exposure to contaminated water while swimming or boating or participating in other recreational activities can cause gastrointestinal and respiratory disease. It is not uncommon for water bodies to experience rapid fluctuations in water quality, and it is therefore vital to be able to predict them accurately and in time so as to minimise population's exposure to pathogenic organisms. E. coli is commonly used as an indicator to measure water quality in freshwater, and higher counts of E. coil are associated with increased risk to illness. In this case study, we compare the performance of a wide range of statistical models in prediction of water quality via E. coli levels for the weekly data collected over the summer months from 2006 to 2014 at the recreational site on the Oreti river in Wallacetown, New Zealand. The models include naive model, multiple linear regression, dynamic regression, regression tree, Markov chain, classification tree, random forests, multinomial logistic regression, discriminant analysis and Bayesian network. The results show that Bayesian network was superior to all the other models. Overall, it had a leave-one-out and k-fold cross validation error rate of 21%, while predicting the majority of instances of E. coli levels classified as unsafe by the Microbiological Water Quality Guidelines for Marine and Freshwater Recreational Areas 2003, New Zealand. Because Bayesian networks are also flexible in handling missing data and outliers and allow for continuous updating in real time, we have found them to be a promising tool, and in the future, plan to extend the analysis beyond the current case study site.

Heuristics pool for hyper-heuristic selection during task allocation in a heterogeneous swarm of marine robots,"Babic, A; Miskovic, N; Vukic, Z","For the purpose of enabling long-term autonomy of a heterogeneous swarm of marine robots, task allocation and sequencing are introduced into the system's energy management procedures. In a scenario where the system needs to autonomously go about its monitoring mission and survive long- term, the available maximum capacity of 5 USVs - aPad platforms which represent the charging hubs of the system - is usually outnumbered by the number of active charging requests, leading to a need for careful planning and optimisation of robot activities. A two-layered system of decision-making algorithms is developed: a low-level specific solution-focused set of algorithms based on various machine learning paradigms, and a high-level hyper-heuristic which selects between them. This paper focuses on the lower level of this decision-making system, and details some of the approaches to task sequencing to be offered for selection, primarily based on differential evolution and k-means clustering, along with factoring in the effects of water currents and wind. Achieved simulation results are discussed and some directions for further work are suggested. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Collective Rights-Based Fishery Management: A Path to Ecosystem-Based Fishery Management,"Holland, DS","Fishery rents may be dissipated across margins not well defined or controlled by an individual transferable quota system. Collective rights-based fishery management (CRBFM), where catch rights are held by a group, can sometimes generate greater benefits and can also address external impacts of the fishery. I discuss potential failures of individual quotas and how these problems were addressed by CRBFM institutions. I then focus on the role of CRBFM in addressing environmental and social impacts external to the group of fishers, such as bycatch, habitat impacts, and spatial conflicts. The review suggests that CRBFM can effectively address both intrafishery and external impacts, provided there is sufficient incentive to do so, including maintaining access to preferred markets or the threat of further regulation. However, CRBFM can create moral hazard and adverse selection problems, and successful CRBFM institutions generally have homogeneous membership with well-aligned interests and/or formal contracts with monitoring and enforcement provisions.",2018,,"ANNUAL REVIEW OF RESOURCE ECONOMICS, VOL 10",10,,469-485,WOS:000447824600023,10.1146/annurev-resource-100517-023110,,#20109,Holland 2018,,
Obesity in Australia,"Huse, O; Hettiarachchi, J; Gearon, E; Nichols, M; Allender, S; Peeters, A","Objectives: To describe prevalence and trends for overweight and obesity in Australia and to critique the quality of available data on this public health priority.Design: Comparison of aggregate prevalence data on adult and childhood overweight and obesity in publicly available national or state-based cross sectional surveys and survey series.Participants: All representative population surveys, conducted since 1995, with measured height and weight at a national or state level.Results: The most recent measured data found that 63.4% of Australian adults and 27.6% of children were overweight or obese in 2014/15. Tasmania had the highest observed adult prevalence of obesity (32.3%) and of overweight and obesity combined (67.5%). The Australian Capital Territory had the lowest observed prevalence of obesity (23.9%) and of overweight and obesity combined (63.0%).Between 2007/08 and 2014/15, the age-standardised prevalence of adulthood overweight and obesity combined increased from 64.4% to 66.4%. Across states/territories the observed change varied from -5.3% (Western Australia) to 6.0% (Queensland). Amongst children the observed prevalence of overweight and obesity combined increased from 24.7% to 27.6%. Across states/territories the observed change varied from -1.4% (South Australia) to 11.1% (Tasmania).Conclusions: In Australia, 1 in 10 more adults are obese today compared to 1995. Limitations in the available data mean it is difficult to conclude on trends over time in children, Indigenous Australians, or by state/territory.

Lifestyle intervention program benefits children with overweigh compared to children with obesity,"Landau, Z; Abiri, S; Lebenthal, Y; Jakubowicz, D; Mor, N; Lerner-Geva, L; Boaz, M; Wainstein, J; Bar-Dayan, Y","Background: Lifestyle weight loss interventions represent the mainstay of treating children with obesity. Long-term follow-up studies of intervention programs are scarce. This study assessed the long-term effects and identified factors associated with significant weight loss.Methods: This prospective, observational study involved 165 children with body mass index (BMI) z-score >= 1.5 who participated in after-school intervention program. Main outcome measure: change in BMI z-scores; decreased BMI z-score >= 0.5 units was defined as clinically significant.Results: At baseline, 55/165 (33.3%) had BMI z-score 1.5-2 and 98 (59.4%) had BMI z-score >2. At follow-up (mean 5.4 +/- 1.4 years), 80 (48.5%) had a clinically significant reduction in BMI z-score, while 56 (33.9%) reported a mildly decrease in BMI z-score of 0-0.5 and 29 (17.6%) reported increased BMI z-score. Lower BMI z-score at baseline and participation in sport activity at follow-up were associated with long-term decrease in BMI z-score. Participation in additional post-intervention weight control programs was correlated with weight gain.Conclusions: Intervention program was associated with long-term improvement in weight control, especially in children with mild obesity. Physical activity was related to long-term success. Participation in an additional intervention program was associated with failure of weight control.

Preventing weight-related problems among adolescent girls: A cluster randomized trial comparing the Brazilian 'New Moves' program versus observation,"Dunker, KLL; Claudino, AM","Purpose: To conduct a duster randomized controlled trial comparing the Brazilian version of the New Moves program (NMP) versus observation among Brazilian adolescent girls.Methods: Ten schools were randomly allocated to the Brazilian NMP or the observation arm. Study participants included 12-14-year-old girls. Recruitment occurred between February 2014 and March 2015. The NMP included sports, nutritional support, motivational interviews, collective lunch, and parental information materials. Our main outcome was the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ). Secondary outcomes included the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Unhealthy Weight-Control Behaviors Index, as well as body mass index. Study results were evaluated through generalized estimating equations.Results: A total of 270 adolescents participated in the study. At baseline, mean age was 13.4 years, and average BMI was 21.4. The intervention did not result in any statistically significant differences between the NMP and the observation arm, including BSQ (predicted means of 64.33 - IC 95% 59.2-69.47 vs. 62.02 - IC 95% 56.63-67.4), respectively) and our secondary outcomes. Adherence was low during the intervention (32.9%) and maintenance (19.1%) phases of the program.Conclusion: The New Moves program did not lead to significant changes in our measured outcomes.

An autonomous underwater vehicle and SUNSET to bridge underwater networks composed of multi-vendor modems,"Ridolfi, A; Spaccini, D; Fanelli, F; Franchi, M; Monni, N; Picari, L; Petrioli, C; Allotta, B","Nowadays, underwater acoustic communication is an interesting topic of research. This is especially true in the case of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs): due to the limitations of the underwater environment, where WiFi and radio communications are limited, it is very important to rely on efficient and reliable tools for acoustic data exchange. Indeed, an underwater network of acoustic nodes can enhance the navigation and localization capabilities of one or more vehicles. However, cooperation and networking is not feasible in underwater networks composed of vehicles with different software architecture and multi-vendor modems due to the lack of communication standards. In this paper, the authors investigate the use of an AUV as a mobile bridging node within a network of fixed heterogeneous acoustic modems. In particular, MARTA AUV, developed and built by the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Florence, is employed to enable data transmission between modems of different manufacturers. The networking and the handling of multiple and multi-vendor modems are instead performed through the SUNSET Software Defined Communication Stack (SDCS) framework, developed by University of Rome La Sapienza jointly with WSENSE Srl. Different bridging tests have been performed in field to evaluate the feasibility of such approach, showing that AUVs can efficiently accomplish the role of gateway between the nodes of the network communicating through the SUNSET SDCS framework.

Participants were classified as metabolically healthy and normal weight (MHNW), MHO, MUNW and metabolically unhealthy overweight or obesity (MUO) at both baseline and follow-up examinations. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess baseline and their changes of BMI-metabolic status and the risk of incident T2DM.Results: Risk of T2DM was increased for all participants with baseline MHO, MUNW, and MUO (adjusted HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.33-2.81; 3.10, 95% CI 2.19-4.39; and 6.63, 95% CI 4.94-8.90, all P < 0.001, respectively). However, risk of T2DM was increased for participants with transformation from MHO to MUO (4.52, 95% CI 2.42-8.47, P < 0.001) as compared with stable MHNW, but not stable MHO (0.53, 95CI 0.20-1.40, P = 0.20).

Psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire in a sample of Taiwanese parents,"Wang, YF; Ha, S; Zauszniewski, JA; Ross, R","The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) appraises overeating styles that may contribute to weight gain in adults. The purpose of this analysis was to assess the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the DEBQ (C-DEBQ) in a sample of parents of school-age children in Taiwan. The C-DEBQ encompassing three subscales that including emotional eating, external eating, and restrained eating. Each subscale's reliability was assessed with Cronbach's alpha internal consistency. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to validate the model fit. A total of 340 normal weight and overweight parents of school-age children from various geographical locations in Taiwan participated in the study. Each subscale, emotional, external, and restrained eating, displayed good-to-excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas: .94,.81, and.89, respectively). CFA showed that the three-factor solution had close goodness-of-fit to the data for supporting the factorial validity (x(2) = 1239.03, df=488, p <.001, x(2)/df = 2.54, root mean square error of approximation =.067, comparative fit index =.879, Tucker-Lewis index =.869). Findings suggest that the C-DEBQ is a psychometrically reliable and valid instrument with the potential to assess overeating styles in Taiwanese parents of school-age children. Replication studies with more age- and gender-diverse populations are needed to provide further evidence of construct validity for the Chinese version of the DEBQ.

A multivariate statistical analysis to evaluate and predict ignition quality of marine diesel fuel distillates from their physical properties,"Karonis, D; Zahos-Siagos, I; Filimon, D; Vasileiou, F","Ignition quality of diesel fuels used in compression ignition engines is mainly described by their respective Cetane Number (CN). The most widely accepted method for CN measurement is the ASTM D613, involving a variable compression ratio Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine. However in the recent years other alternative methods based on a Constant Volume Combustion Chamber (CVCC) concept have gained significant popularity mainly due to lower cost of acquisition, maintenance and operation, still being able to provide accurate results. Other widely accepted parameters for the characterization of ignition quality of diesel fuels are cetane indices. These are empirical mathematical equations, based on simple physicochemical properties (such as density and distillation characteristics) and usually correlate well with CN. However, they are accurate enough within narrow limits and are very prone to produce misleading results when involving modern fuels, or biofuels and their blends. In this work, an effort was made to investigate the room for improvement for the prediction of CN, apart from the use of the most widely accepted method of Calculated Cetane Index (CCI), standardized by ASTM D4737, with regard to today's used marine diesel fuels. A total of 47 distillate marine diesel fuels (with high sulfur content compared to automotive diesel fuels) has been employed in order to create multivariate regression models to predict CN equivalents. Thus, useful conclusions were drown in an attempt to evaluate the importance of various physicochemical properties with regard to ignition quality, as well as a first step to the potentiality of revaluation of empirical mathematical models currently in use.

Prospective associations between peer teasing in childhood and young men's obesity,"Kerr, DCR; Gini, G","Objective: Being teased and otherwise victimised by peers during childhood increases risk for obesity. However, few prospective studies have considered whether risk extends to adulthood. We tested whether being teased in childhood predicted higher body mass index (BMI) and increased odds of obesity in early adulthood in a community sample of American males.Method: Boys (n = 206) were classified as victims of peer teasing or non-victims (n = 55 and 151, respectively) based on mother, father, and teacher reports at ages 10-12 years. BMI was assessed at ages 24 or 32 years for 203 of the participants. Family income, parent and child depressive symptoms, child antisocial behaviour, and childhood BMI were assessed at ages 10-13 years and served as control variables.Results: In unadjusted comparisons, childhood victims did not differ significantly from non-victims on BMI (mean [SD] = 27.49 [4.53] and 26.97 [4.60], respectively) or rates of obesity (42% and 31%, respectively) in early adulthood. In adjusted models, no group differences emerged for BMI (beta [95% confidence interval (CI)] = .02 [-.09 to .13], p=.77) or obesity (odds ratio [95% CI] = 1.58 [.67-3.71], p=.30).Conclusions: Peer victimization has been associated with immediate and long-term maladjustment outcomes that are in some cases life threatening. However, our null results do not support that peer victimization significantly increases long-term risk for obesity, and findings are consistent with two other long-term prospective studies of this issue.

Linear mixed modelling was used to assess percentage weight change after adjusting for covariates.Results: Participant's mean age was 48.5 years, 78.7% were of white ethnicity, 90.3% female and mean baseline BMI was 36.3 kg/m(2). There were no significant differences in percentage weight loss, between participants that self-referred and those that were referred by their general practitioner (GP) and no significant differences between baseline BMI categories. Referral to a weight loss programme more than once was associated with less weight loss at subsequent attendances (0.92%, 95% CI 0.70-1.14, p < 0.001).Conclusion: Allowing self-referral to a weight loss programme widens access without compromising amount of weight lost. These programmes are beneficial for all categories of obesity, including those with a BMI >= 40 kg/m(2). Attending weight management programmes more than once results in less weight loss and that swapping to a different program may be advisable.

Comparison of anthropometric measurements associated with the risk of endoscopic erosive esophagitis: A cross-sectional study,"Park, JK; Lim, Y; Lee, H; Kim, TJ; Choi, YH; Min, YW; Min, BH; Lee, JH; Rhee, PL; Kim, JJ","Background: In this cross-sectional study, we assessed five anthropometric measurements to determine the most reliable indicator of the erosive esophagitis (EE) risk: body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist to height ratio (WHtR), a body shape index (ABSI), and body roundness index (BRI).Methods: This study included 182,407 participants who underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy as part of a routine health check-up. We used the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess the discriminatory power of each anthropometric measure as an indicator of EE risk.Results: The prevalence of EE increased per quartile for all five anthropometric measurements in patients of both sexes (1st quartile vs. 4th quartile, all P < 0.05). ABSI had the lowest AUCs for EE in both sexes (AUC: 0.524, 95% CI: 0.519-0.529 for male patients; AUC: 0.524, 95% CI: 0.513-0.535 for female patients). In contrast, BRI was the best predictor of EE in male patients (OR: 2.095, 95% CI: 1.982-2.215, P < 0.0001), and WC was the best predictor of EE in female patients (OR: 2.028, 95% CI: 1.785-2.307, P<0.0001). WC showed the highest AUC values for EE in both male patients (AUC: 0.571, 95% CI: 0.566-0.576) and female patients (AUC: 0.596, 95% CI: 0.585-0.608).Conclusions: BRI and WC were the most relevant indicators of EE risk in male and female patients, respectively. ABSI was the least reliable indicator of EE risk in patients of both sexes. (C) 2017 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Co-robotics hands-on activities: A gateway to engineering design and STEM learning,"Ziaeefard, S; Miller, MH; Rastgaar, M; Mahmoudian, N","This paper presents the effect of meaningful learning contexts and hands-on activities, facilitated using two robots that work with people (co-robots), in broadening and sustaining pre-college student engagement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The two co-robots are: (1) a Glider for Underwater Problem-solving and Promotion of Interest in Engineering or GUPPIE and (2) a Neurally controlled manipulator called Neu-pulator. The co-robots are easy and inexpensive to manufacture, with readily available lightweight and durable components. They are also modular to accommodate a variety of learning activities that help young students to learn crosscutting concepts and engineering practice. The early assessment results show that students' interests in activities related to robotics depend on their perception of the difficulty and their confidence level. The key is to start early when the students are young. The challenge is to break the barriers and define tasks as fun activities with a learn and play approach that can be rewarding. In this work, using a meaningful context - as in co-robots that help humans - in a hands-on project-based program that integrates different aspect of design, science, and technology is found effective in increasing students' enthusiasm and participation. The co-robots and the hands-on activities can be easily adopted in classrooms by teachers with no engineering background who seek innovative ways to connect interdisciplinary core ideas and standards to the concepts they need to teach.

"Associations between language acculturation, age of immigration, and obesity in the Mexican American Mano A Mano cohort","Chrisman, M; Chow, WH; Daniel, CR; Wu, XF; Zhao, H","Introduction: As Mexican immigrants to the U.S. become acculturated, they face worsening health outcomes such as obesity. The role of language acculturation in the development of obesity has not been thoroughly examined.Methods: To examine associations between language acculturation and obesity, data were drawn from the Mexican American Mano A Mano cohort study. Participants aged 20 years and over (n = 18,298) completed baseline questionnaires on socio-demographic and behavioural factors, including physical activity and sitting time. The Bi-dimensional Acculturation Scale for Hispanics assessed language acculturation. Multivariate-adjusted logistic regression was conducted to investigate associations between language acculturation, immigration age, and obesity, and whether sitting time and physical activity mediated these associations.Results: Individuals with obesity were more linguistically acculturated than individuals who were normal weight or overweight (P<0.001); however, this relationship differed by gender and nativity. Among Mexico-born women, language acculturation score was inversely related to BMI (P<0.001). Language acculturation was associated with higher risk of obesity (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.12-1.62) in U.S.-born participants and lower risk in Mexico-born participants (OR = 0.90, 95%Cl = 0.81-1.00). For Mexico-born participants, arrival in the U.S. as an adult (>= 20 years old) was associated with a reduced obesity risk (OR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.67-0.80). Sitting time mediated the association between language acculturation and obesity.Conclusions: Language acculturation may influence obesity development among the U.S.-born Mexican Americans in this cohort, but not their Mexico-born counterparts. Sitting time could be targeted in obesity prevention efforts in this population. (C) 2017 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Fishing for leadership: The role diversification plays in facilitating change agents,"Stoll, JS","Leadership is often viewed as being critical to successful natural resource management. This research focuses on a set of leaders identified through a social network analysis of fishers in a rural coastal region. Leaders' connections to different fisheries are evaluated, and these actors are found to be significantly more diversified than other fishers in the area. Drawing on theory related to institutional entrepreneurship and a series of in-depth interviews with these actors, this paper puts forward several hypotheses to explain how diverse social-ecological connections facilitate leadership. Three mechanisms are identified. Being diversified facilitates: (1) production of alternative visions; (2) framing of tractable strategies to sustain local marine resource; and (3) participation in the management process. While more research is needed to understand the relationship between diversification and leadership, these exploratory results suggest that leadership is, in part, a manifestation of ecological circumstance, supporting recent assertions that scholarship on leadership in natural resource management settings could benefit from being more attentive to the processes that shape leadership rather than fixating on individuals and their personal attributes. Given that fisheries policies increasingly constrain diversification, policymakers and managers should consider how specialization of fishers might change the form and function of leaders in the future.

Projected changes of the southwest Australian wave climate under two atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration pathways,"Wandres, M; Pattiaratchi, C; Hemer, MA","Incident wave energy flux is responsible for sediment transport and coastal erosion in wave-dominated regions such as the southwestern Australian (SWA) coastal zone. To evaluate future wave climates under increased greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, past studies have forced global wave simulations with wind data sourced from global climate model (GCM) simulations. However, due to the generally coarse spatial resolution of global climate and wave simulations, the effects of changing offshore wave conditions and sea level rise on the nearshore wave climate are still relatively unknown. To address this gap of knowledge, we investigated the projected SWA offshore, shelf, and nearshore wave climate under two potential future greenhouse gas concentration trajectories (representative concentration pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). This was achieved by downscaling an ensemble of global wave simulations, forced with winds from GCMs participating in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5), into two regional domains, using the Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) wave model. The wave climate is modeled for a historical 20-year time slice (1986-2005) and a projected future 20-year time-slice (2081-2100) for both scenarios. Furthermore, we compare these scenarios to the effects of considering sea-level rise (SLR) alone (stationary wave climate), and to the effects of combined SLR and projected wind-wave change. Results indicated that the SWA shelf and nearshore wave climate is more sensitive to changes in offshore mean wave direction than offshore wave heights. Nearshore, wave energy flux was projected to increase by similar to 10% in exposed areas and decrease by similar to 10% in sheltered areas under both climate scenarios due to a change in wave directions, compared to an overall increase of 2-4% in offshore wave heights. With SLR, the annual mean wave energy flux was projected to increase by up to 20% in shallow water (<30 m) as a result of decreased wave dissipation. In winter months, the longshore wave energy flux, which is responsible for littoral drift, is expected to increase by up to 39% (62%) under the RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas concentration pathway with SLR. The study highlights the importance of using high-resolution wave simulations to evaluate future regional wave climates, since the coastal wave climate is more responsive to changes in wave direction and sea level than offshore wave heights.

INDIVIDUO: Results from a patient-centered lifestyle intervention for obesity surgery candidates,"Camolas, J; Santos, O; Moreira, P; do Carmo, I","Background: Preoperative nutritional counseling provides an opportunity to ameliorate patients' clinical condition and build-up adequate habits and perception of competence. Study aimed to evaluate: (a) the effect of INDIVIDUO on weight and metabolic control; (b) the impact of INDIVIDUO on psychosocial variables associated with successful weight-control.Methods: Two-arms randomised controlled single-site study, with six-month duration. Patients were recruited from an Obesity Treatment Unit's waiting list. For the intervention group (IG), an operating procedure manual was used, nutritionists received training/supervision regarding INDIVIDUO's procedures. Control group (CG) received health literacy-promoting intervention. Intention-to-treat and per-control analysis were used. Outcomes included weight, metabolic control variables (blood pressure, glycemia, insulinemia, triglycerides, cholesterol), measures of eating and physical activity patterns, hedonic hunger, autonomous/controlled regulation, perceived competence for diet (PCS-diet) and quality of life. Primary outcomes were weight and metabolic control. Effect size was estimated by odds ratio and Cohens'd coefficient.Results: Overall, 94 patients participated (IG: 45; CG: 49) and 60 completed the study( IG: 29; CG: 31). Intervention patients lost an excess 9.68% body weight (%EWL), vs. 0.51% for CG. Adjusting for age and baseline BMI, allocation group remained an independent predictor of % EWL (B = 8.43, 95% CI: 2.79-14.06). IG had a six-fold higher-probability (OR: 6.35, 95% CI: 1.28-31.56) of having adequate/ controlled fastingglycemia final evaluation. PCS-diet at final evaluation was independently predictedby baseline PCS-diet (B = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.06-0.64), variation in autonomous regulation( B = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.15-0.71) and allocation group (B = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.04-1.36).Conclusions: Results on weight and metabolic control support INDIVIDUO as a valuable clinical tool for obesity surgery candidates counseling.

Coastal zones that are increasingly impacted by anthropogenic development have experienced substantial declines in seagrass abundance around the world. Australia, which has some of the world's largest seagrass meadows and is home to over half of the known species, is not immune to these losses. In 1999 a review of seagrass ecosystems knowledge was conducted in Australia and strategic research priorities were developed to provide research direction for future studies and management. Subsequent rapid evolution of seagrass research and scientific methods has led to more than 70% of peer reviewed seagrass literature being produced since that time. A workshop was held as part of the Australian Marine Sciences Association conference in July 2015 in Geelong, Victoria, to update and redefine strategic priorities in seagrass research. Participants identified 40 research questions from 10 research fields (taxonomy and systematics, physiology, population biology, sediment biogeochemistry and microbiology, ecosystem function, faunal habitats, threats, rehabilitation and restoration, mapping and monitoring, management tools) as priorities for future research on Australian seagrasses. Progress in research will rely on advances in areas such as remote sensing, genomic tools, microsensors, computer modeling, and statistical analyses. A more interdisciplinary approach will be needed to facilitate greater understanding of the complex interactions among seagrasses and their environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Amplified Late Pliocene terrestrial warmth in northern high latitudes from greater radiative forcing and closed Arctic Ocean gateways,"Feng, R; Otto-Bliesner, BL; Fletcher, TL; Tabor, CR; Ballantyne, AP; Brady, EC","Proxy reconstructions of the mid-Piacenzian warm period (mPWP, between 3.264 and 3.025 Ma) suggest terrestrial temperatures were much warmer in the northern high latitudes (55 degrees-90 degrees N, referred to as NHL) than present-day. Climate models participating in the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 1 (PlioMIP1) tend to underestimate this warmth. For instance, the underestimate is similar to 10 degrees C on average across NHL and up to 17 degrees C in the Canadian Arctic region in the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4). Here, we explore potential mPWP climate forcings that might contribute to this mPWP mismatch. We carry out seven experiments to assess terrestrial temperature responses to Pliocene Arctic gateway closure, variations in CO2 level, and orbital forcing at millennial time scale.To better compare the full range of simulated terrestrial temperatures with sparse proxy data, we introduce a pattern recognition technique that simplifies the model surface temperatures to a few representative patterns that can be validate with the limited terrestrial proxy data. The pattern recognition technique reveals two prominent features of simulated Pliocene surface temperature responses. First, distinctive patterns of amplified warming occur in the NHL, which can be explained by lowered surface elevation of Greenland, pattern and amount of Arctic sea ice loss, and changing strength of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Second, patterns of surface temperature response are similar among experiments with different forcing mechanisms. This similarity is due to strong feedbacks from responses in surface albedo and troposphere water vapor content to sea ice changes, which overwhelm distinctions in forcings from changes in insolation, CO2 forcing, and Arctic gateway closure.By comparing CCSM4 simulations with proxy records, we demonstrate that both model and proxy records show similar patterns of mPWP NHL terrestrial warmth, but the model underestimates the magnitude. High insolation, greater CO2 forcing, and Arctic gateways closure each contributes to reduce the underestimate by enhancing the Arctic warmth of 1-2 degrees C. These results highlight the importance of considering proxy NHL warmth in the context of Pliocene Arctic gateway changes, and variations in insolation and CO2 forcing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"High selenium exposure lowers the odds ratios for hypertension, stroke, and myocardial infarction associated with mercury exposure among Inuit in Canada","Hu, XF; Eccles, KM; Chan, HM","Background: Selenium (Se) has been reported to protect against the neurotoxicity of mercury (Hg). However, the effect of Se against Hg on cardiovascular diseases remains unclear. Inuit living in the Arctic have high exposure to both Se and Hg through their marine mammal and fish rich traditional diet.Objective: To characterize the co-exposure of Hg and Se among Inuit in Canada and to assess the associations between Hg, Se and cardiovascular health outcomes, including stroke, hypertension, and myocardial infarction (MI).Methods: Data was collected from the International Polar Year Inuit Health Survey (IHS) conducted in 2007 and 2008. Blood Se and Hg were measured, and self-report cardiovascular health outcomes were collected through a questionnaire interview from 2169 adults aged 18 and above.Results: The mean age was 42.4 years, and 38.7% of the participants were male. The geometric means (GM) of blood Se and total Hg were 319.5 mu g/L and 7.0 mu g/L, respectively. The crude prevalence of heart attack, stroke and hypertension were 3.55%, 2.36%, and 24.47% respectively. Participants were categorized into 4 exposure groups according to blood Hg (high: >= 7.8 mu g/L; low: <7.8 mu g/L), and Se (high: >= 280 mu g/L; low: <280 mu g/L). The odds ratio (OR) of cardiovascular outcomes were estimated using general linearized models. Results showed the low Se and high Hg group had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (OR = 1.76 for hypertension, 1.57 for stroke, and 126 for MI. However, the prevalence was decreased in both the high Se and low Hg group (OR = 0.57 for hypertension, 0.44 for stroke, and 0.27 for MI) and the high Se and high Hg group (OR = 1.14 for hypertension, 031 for stroke, and 0.80 for MI).Conclusions: The high Se and low Hg group had the lowest prevalence of cardiovascular outcomes, except for stroke. These results provide evidence that Se may exhibit a protective effect against Hg on cardiovascular disease. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Association between the Family Nutrition and Physical Activity Screening Tool and obesity severity in youth referred to weight management,"Tucker, JM; Howard, K; Guseman, EH; Yee, KE; Saturley, H; Eisenmann, JC","Background: The Family Nutrition and Physical Activity Screening Tool (FNPA) evaluates family behavioural and environmental factors associated with pediatric obesity, but it is unknown if FNPA scores differ among youth across obesity severities. Our aim was to determine the association between the FNPA and obesity severity in youth referred to weight management.Methods: Upon initiating treatment, height, weight, and the FNPA were collected according to standard procedures. Cut-points for overweight/obesity, severe obesity (SO) class 2, and SO class 3 were calculated. FNPA scores were compared across weight status groups using analysis of covariance, and odds of SO across FNPA quartiles were evaluated with multiple logistic regression.Results: Participants included 564 5-18 year old who initiated treatment and completed the FNPA. After adjustment, FNPA scores differed by weight status with higher/healthier scores in youth with overweight/obesity (56.6 +/- 8.5) when compared to those with SO class 2 (55.0 +/- 7.1; p = 0.015) or SO class 3 (53.6 +/- 9.0; p < 0.001). Compared to those in the highest FNPA quartile, youth in the 2nd quartile had 1.8 (95% CI: 1.1, 2.9) times higher odds of SO, and those in the lowest FNPA quartile had 2.1 (95% CI: 1.3, 3.4) times higher odds of SO. Youth with SO had unhealthier subscale scores among 6 of 10 constructs, including nutritional, physical activity, sedentary, and sleep behaviours.Conclusions: Results suggest a consistent inverse relationship between the FNPA and adiposity among youth presenting for weight management. The FNPA is a useful metric for programs and clinicians targeting family behaviours and the home environment to combat obesity. (C) 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

Repair vs replacement of direct composite restorations: a survey of teaching and operative techniques in Oceania,"Brunton, PA; Ghazali, A; Tarif, ZH; Loch, C; Lynch, C; Wilson, N; Blum, IR","Objectives: To evaluate the teaching and operative techniques for the repair and/or replacement of direct resin-based composite restorations (DCRs) in dental schools in Oceania.Methods: A 14-item questionnaire was mailed to the heads of operative dentistry in 16 dental schools in Oceania (Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea). The survey asked whether the repair of DCRs was taught within the curriculum; the rationale behind the teaching; how techniques were taught, indications for repair, operative techniques, materials used, patient acceptability, expected longevity and recall systems.Results: All 16 schools participated in the study. Thirteen (81%) reported the teaching of composite repairs as an alternative to replacement. Most schools taught the theoretical and practical aspects of repair at a clinical level only. All 13 schools (100%) agreed on tooth substance preservation being the main reason for teaching repair. The main indications for repair were marginal defects (100%), followed by secondary caries (69%). All 13 schools that performed repairs reported high patient acceptability, and considered it a definitive measure. Only three schools (23%) claimed to have a recall system in place following repair of DCRs. Most respondents either did not know or did not answer when asked about the longevity of DCRs.Conclusions: Repair of DCRs seems to be a viable alternative to replacement, which is actively taught within Oceania. Advantages include it being minimally invasive, preserving tooth structure, and time and money saving. However, standardised guidelines need to be developed and further clinical long-term studies need to be carried out. Clinical significance: The decision between replacing or repairing a defective composite restoration tends to be based on what clinicians have been taught, tempered by experience and judgement. This study investigated the current status of teaching and operative techniques of repair of direct composite restorations in dental schools in Oceania. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimating harvest and its uncertainty in heterogeneous recreational fisheries,"Cabanellas-Reboredo, M; Palmer, M; Alos, J; Morales-Nin, B","Although some stocks are being severely exploited by recreational fishing, estimating the biomass extracted (harvest, H) by recreational fisheries is difficult, especially for marine recreational fisheries. One way to estimate H by recreational fisheries is to combine the fishing effort (E) with catch-per-unit of -effort (CPUE) data. However, naively ignoring heterogeneity in E and CPUE may result in biased and imprecise estimates of H. We propose a framework to address three relevant heterogeneity levels: the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of recreational E, environmental effects on recreational CPUE, and the variability in angler skills (between-angler heterogeneity). Specifically, we combine (i) space-time model predictions of E (number of boats per km2) on the day scale (i.e., fishing trips), (ii) environmentally driven model predictions of daily catch (number of squid per fishing trip), and (iii) off-and on-site surveys to account for angler heterogeneity. The precision of the H estimates was assessed using bootstrap confidence intervals. This framework was applied to the recreational fishery for the squid Loligo vulgaris at Palma Bay (Mallorca Island, western Mediterranean). The estimated effort was 15,750 angler-fishing trips (95% Cl: 13,086 to 18,569), which yielded an annual harvest of 20.6 tons (95% Cl: 16.9-24.5). This harvest was estimated to represent 34% of the total commercial landings in Mallorca, which highlights the importance of recreational harvesting and the need to account for recreational fisheries to improve squid stock management. The framework proposed here provides a promising tool for estimating H in other heterogeneous recreational fisheries and may be the first step toward assessing the actual impact of recreational fisheries on squid populations.

Organic geochemistry of rocks of the Mesoproterozoic Malgin Formation and their depositional environments (southeastern Siberian Platform),"Suslova, EA; Parfenova, TM; Saraev, SV; Nagovitsyn, KE","Organic matter (OM) and rocks of the upper member of the Mesoproterozoic Malgin Formation in the southeastern Siberian Platform have been studied by modern research methods. Analysis has revealed homologous series of alkanes, tricyclanes, and hopanes in the bitumens. Leiosphaeridia crassa, L. minutissima, cf. Leiosphaeridia tenuissima, cf. Glomovertella, and Oscillatoriopsis sp. have been identified among the rare microfossils preserved in mudstones. Geochemical, lithological, and paleontological studies have shown that bacterial microcommunities and, to a lesser extent, eukaryotic microorganisms were the main source of OM. Based on results of sedimentological analysis and study of biomarkers, the depositional environment has been reconstructed. A model for the accumulation of black shales and carbonate rocks of the Malgin Formation is considered. The hypothesis that the highly carbonaceous rocks formed in uncompensated depressions of shallow epicontinental marine suboxidation environments is substantiated. The petroleum potential and degree of OM catagenesis of the Malgin Formation rocks are evaluated. Pyrolysis, bitumen analysis, and hydrocarbon composition study have revealed autochthonous and parautochthonous bitumens in the oil shales, mudstones, and carbonate rocks. The obtained data show that the Malgin Formation rocks might have participated in petroleum generation in the Uchur-Maya region. (C) 2017, V.S. Sobolev IGM, Siberian Branch of the RAS.

Short-step synthesis and structure-activity relationship of cortistatin A analogs,"Kotoku, N; Ito, A; Shibuya, S; Mizuno, K; Takeshima, A; Nogata, M; Kobayashi, M","An improved method for synthesizing structurally simplified analogs of cortistatin A (1), a novel antiangiogenic steroidal alkaloid from a marine sponge, was developed. In contrast to previous methods, step-and redox-economical synthesis was achieved using a known alpha-bromoketone as the starting material. The structure-activity relationship study revealed that the isoquinoline portion was strictly recognized by the target molecule. Surprisingly, the introduction of the acetamide moiety on the A-ring structure dramatically enhanced the selective antiproliferative activity against endothelial cells.

Eco-physiological responses to salinity changes across the freshwater-marine continuum on two euryhaline bivalves: Corbicula fluminea and Scrobicularia plana,"Bertrand, C; Devin, S; Mouneyrac, C; Giamberini, L","The influence of global climate change will potentially alter the salinity of aquatic ecosystems. This represents a tremendous challenge for societies worldwide. Different sources of salinization (natural or anthropogenic) amplify the introduction of salt in rivers and streams, causing an increase of salt flowing down to estuarine and coastal areas. In this study, Corbicula fluminea and Scrobicularia plana have been selected because of their large tolerance for salinity variation (euryhaline organisms). They will allow the study of effect on the whole spectrum of salinity from fresh to marine waters respectively. The aim was to study the impact of experimental salinity stress at physiological, biochemical and behavioral levels by exposing both species to a salinity close to their limit range of tolerance, 15 practical salinity unit (psu), and at their field salinity (1.5 psu and 30 psu for C fluminea and S. plane respectively) in the presence or absence of food during 2 and 7 days of exposure. Negative impacts of hyper saline condition for C.fluminea (15 psu) and hypo saline condition for S. plana (15 psu) have been measured at biochemical, physiological and behavioral levels. At sub-individual and individual levels, structural and energetic parameters and behavioral impairments seemed to be suitable biomarkers to assess salinity stress on C. fluminea and S.plana. After exposure to the limit of salinity tolerance (15psu) for both organisms, fitness modifications could appear, and may participate in endangering populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Intended and unintended outcomes in fisheries learning exchanges: Lessons from Mexico and Madagascar,"Gardner, CJ; Latham, JE; Rocliffe, S","Fisheries learning exchanges (FLEs) bring together fisher communities to exchange knowledge and experiences, with the goal of building social capital and disseminating management techniques. In 2015 two groups of octopus fishers from Bahia de los Angeles, Mexico and Sarodrano, Madagascar travelled to Andavadoaka, southwest Madagascar to learn about the temporary fishing closures for octopus used in the region. Octopus fisheries in Madagascar and Mexico differ in several respects, particularly harvesting techniques. The FLE was qualitatively evaluated through participant observation and semi-structured key informant (KI) interviews. Thirty before-and-after interviews were carried out with 16 KIs including visitors, hosts and organisers. Informants suggested that holding the FLE at the same time as the closure openings allowed for learning benefits but carried an important opportunity cost for organisers and host participants, and that shortcomings of planning and translation capacity limited learning opportunities. Several KIs were concerned about the applicability of the Malagasy management model to the Mexican context concerned, and the FLE may have had unforeseen consequences since Malagasy fishers were excited to learn a new fishing method (trapping) from the visitors: if effective, trapping could negatively impact Malagasy octopus stocks. The exchange of knowledge in the FLE was primarily one-way, from host to visitor, and most organisers did not view themselves as participants. Recommendations to improve the effectiveness of future FLEs include: (i) improving facilitation and translation capacity to promote dialogue, (ii) focusing on key messages, (iii) selecting appropriate participants and (iv) recruiting a specialist to organise and lead exchanges.

An exploration of factors influencing attrition from a pediatric weight management intervention,"Kwitowski, M; Bean, MK; Mazzeo, SE","Pediatric obesity is a public health concern. High attrition from treatment negatively impacts outcomes, particularly among lower income and ethnic minority populations. NOURISH+ is a parent-exclusive childhood weight management treatment targeting at-risk children aged 5-11 years who are overweight or obese. The current study sought to enhance understanding of attrition among at-risk families. NOURISH+ participants completed a survey assessing barriers to treatment adherence. Among low-income, racially diverse families, practical barriers are pressing concerns. The NOURISH+ parent-exclusive approach, although empirically supported, appears inconsistent with caregivers' expectations. Minimizing practical barriers and enhancing child engagement might reduce attrition and improve outcomes. (C) 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluating a digital ship design tool prototype: Designers' perceptions of novel ergonomics software,"Mallam, SC; Lundh, M; MacKinnon, SN","Computer-aided solutions are essential for naval architects to manage and optimize technical complexities when developing a ship's design. Although there are an array of software solutions aimed to optimize the human element in design, practical ergonomics methodologies and technological solutions have struggled to gain widespread application in ship design processes. This paper explores how a new ergonomics technology is perceived by naval architecture students using a mixed-methods framework. Thirteen Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering Masters students participated in the study. Overall, results found participants perceived the software and its embedded ergonomics tools to benefit their design work, increasing their empathy and ability to understand the work environment and work demands end-users face. However, participant's questioned if ergonomics could be practically and efficiently implemented under real-world project constraints. This revealed underlying social biases and a fundamental lack of understanding in engineering postgraduate students regarding applied ergonomics in naval architecture. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Mexican origins for the Texas green turtle foraging aggregation: A cautionary tale of incomplete baselines and poor marker resolution,"Shamblin, BM; Dutton, PH; Shaver, DJ; Bagley, DA; Putman, NF; Mansfield, KL; Ehrhart, LM; Pena, LJ; Nairn, CJ","The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) foraging aggregation along the Texas coast has increased dramatically in recent years, but the source populations for these turtles have not been adequately resolved. Previous mixed stock analysis (MSA) based on 490 base pair (bp) mitochondrial control region haplotypes suggested a large Florida contribution, but widespread sharing of common haplotypes among potential source populations and incomplete source population baseline data precluded precise assessment. To test the hypothesis that Texas turtles may represent proximal western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) nesting populations, we analyzed novel rookery samples from Rancho Nuevo, Tamaulipas, Mexico (RNMX) and conducted oceanic connectivity simulations. The RNMX samples yielded haplotypes CM-A1.1 and CM-A3.1 in frequencies not significantly different from those of the central eastern Florida nesting population. However, mitogenomic sequencing identified a diagnostic mitochondria( SNP (mtSNP) variant that is fixed in RNMX relative to the Florida CM-A1.1 lineage. Pairwise comparisons indicate that the Tamaulipas rookery represents a discrete population relative to those previously described in the northern Greater Caribbean, warranting recognition of a western GoM management unit (MU). Contrary to previous findings, the Florida populations were ruled out as major contributors to the Texas aggregation through screening of the mtSNP. Mixed stock analysis incorporating the mtSNP data suggested a western GoM origin for approximately 70% of the Texas foraging aggregation, with Quintana Roo contributing the majority of the remainder. Backtracking simulations within an ocean circulation model were broadly congruent with genetic results in indicating substantial probability of oceanic transport from Mexican rookeries to the Texas coast (68%) while also dismissing the possibility of transport from the eastern Florida rookeries (0%). The mixed stock analyses and backtracking simulations are consistent with previous hypotheses implicating oceanic dispersal followed by natal homing by neritic juveniles to explain juvenile green turtle distributions. In contrast to a pattern of stepping stone connectivity across the remaining northern Greater Caribbean, the Texas foraging aggregation was distinct from all others analyzed in the region, including one in the eastern GoM. This isolation highlights the significance of Texas as developmental habitat for the proposed western GoM MU and reiterates the importance of continued international cooperation to facilitate recovery of this stock. This study also underscores the importance of satisfying underlying assumptions of mixed stock analysis in order to make robust inferences of connectivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Short sleep duration and obesity among children: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies,"Wu, YH; Gong, QH; Zou, ZQ; Li, H; Zhang, XH","Objective: Previous epidemiology studies have demonstrated that short sleep duration may be associated with the development of obesity, although the effects remain controversial. This study aimed to assess epidemiologic evidence systematically on the relation between sleep duration and obesity in children.Design and methods: We searched the Medline, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Science Citation Index databases and reference lists of the included articles. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using a random-effects model.Results: Fifty cohorts from thirteen studies were included in the pooled analysis. They included 35,540 participants from around the world. In children/adolescents the pooled OR was 1.71 (1.36-2.14; I-2 = 91.3%), the positive association was consistent after omitting any of the studies. In subgroup analyses, the results indicated that the heterogeneity of effect may due to differences in geographical location, cut-off for short sleep duration and definition of obesity/overweight. The publication bias tests indicated a no evidence of publication bias.Conclusion: This meta-analysis provides evidence that short sleep duration in children is associated with a significantly increased risk of obesity. Enough sleep duration is potentially important for the prevention of obesity among children. (C) 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Situating Arab-Israeli artisanal fishermen's perceptions of marine litter in a socio-institutional and socio-cultural context,"Brennan, RE; Portman, ME","Understanding the mental constructs underlying people's social responses, decisions and behaviors is crucial to defining the governance challenges faced in dealing with marine anthropogenic litter. Using interactive governance theory, this study provides qualitative insights into how a small group of Arab-Israeli artisanal fishermen perceive marine litter and its impact (system to be governed) in the context of the socio-institutional structures (governing system) which manage waste and aim to protect the surrounding environment It demonstrates that, until the relationships between local people and the various governing institutions are transformed, there is little hope for citizen cooperation in reducing marine litter long-term in the case-study site. More generally, underlying narratives and politics playing out at a local level need to be understood in order to identify which interventions are likely to be effective and which are not.

Marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids affect the blood pressure control in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension - a 1-year follow-up study,"Bagge, CN; Strandhave, C; Skov, CM; Svensson, M; Schmidt, EB; Christensen, JH","Marine long-chained n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are recognized for their cardioprotective effects, including potential lowering of blood pressure. We hypothesized that higher habitual fish intake and n-3 PUFA plasma levels were associated with lower blood pressure and being less likely to receive antihypertensive medication after one-year followup. In this prospective study of 115 patients, we assessed 24 h ambulatory and central blood pressure, plasma phospholipid fatty acid composition using gas chromatography and participants completed a food frequency questionnaire, including fish-eating habits. All measurements were repeated at one-year follow-up. At baseline, patients consuming fish >= 2 times per month for dinner had significantly higher plasma levels of total marine n-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid as well as significantly lower central blood pressure and a trend towards lower peripheral blood pressure. At follow-up, 21 patients (18%) without antihypertensive medication had significantly higher plasma levels of n-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid as well as a higher, but still acceptable 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (137/85 mmHg) compared to subjects receiving antihypertensive medication. The untreated group was more prone to take fish oil capsules and increased their plasma levels of n-3 PUFA compared to baseline. In patients with newly diagnosed, untreated hypertension, regular fish consumption was accompanied by lower blood pressure. After one year, patients without antihypertensive medication were characterized by a significant increase and higher plasma levels of n-3 PUFA. This supports a blood pressure-lowering effect and suggests an increase in marine n-3 PUFA intake as part of non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Integrating stakeholder perceptions and preferences on ecosystem services in the management of coastal areas,"de Juan, S; Gelcich, S; Fernandez, M","The consideration of stakeholders' perceptions and preferences on different ecosystem services, identifying potential conflict areas, is essential for operationalizing integrated management plans. In the central coast of Chile, several traditional fishing resources are overexploited and conflicts between users might arise with the increasing demand of both traditional and new uses. The principal groups of users in coastal areas were characterized in order to generate information that advances towards integrative approaches in the region. Face-to-face surveys to fishermen, tourists and permanent residents were conducted in six coastal sites to identify what these groups value the most, assessing at the same time if differences in perceptions and use might suggest future conflicts between users associated to coastal planning. Participants had to prioritize a list of coastal attributes associated with ecosystem services. Results show variability in prioritization of coastal attributes amongst groups of users, however, variability across sites was low. Fishermen showed a tight economic and cultural dependency on provisioning services; however, their general perception was of decreasing catches and a shift to less valued resources and habitat structuring species as traditional ecosystem services deteriorate. Tourists and residents had the most homogenous perceptions, and agreed on the prioritization of intangible services, such as the quietness and scenery of the coast. Nevertheless, deterioration of the environment was perceived as relevant by the inhabitants of the study area, reflecting a potential conflict between the current increase in tourist influx and resource demand. Therefore, increasing recreational use needs to be managed, ensuring the resilience of the traditional fisheries and adopting effective actions that should encompass wider ecosystem objectives. However, the real challenge for integrated management is the incorporation of intangible values in conservation objectives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Marine angler characteristics and attitudes toward stock enhancement in Florida,"Garlock, TM; Lorenzen, K","Fisheries stock enhancement, the release of hatchery-reared fish into wild fish populations with the aim of improving fisheries, is a common management strategy of variable success that also involves substantial tradeoffs between fisheries management objectives. We conducted an internet-based survey to assess attitudes towards fisheries stock enhancement and other management measures among marine inshore anglers in Florida. A random sample of 200,000 fishing license holders was selected from Florida's recreational saltwater license holders. The survey received a response rate of 5.2%. The survey was designed to collect information on angler participation, fishing experience, catch preferences and motivations in addition to attitudes toward management options including fisheries stock enhancement. The concepts of recreation specialization and consumptive orientation were used to explore diversity in management perspectives and attitudes towards fish stocking. Hierarchical cluster analysis of five specialization variables was used to identify three groups of inshore anglers. Angler groups had different levels of participation, skill, fishing-related expenditures and management preferences including support for fisheries stock enhancement. Inshore anglers were generally supportive of fisheries stock enhancement, but less so than many alternative management strategies including habitat restoration and traditional bag and minimum size limits. The most specialized anglers showed significantly higher levels of support for stock enhancement and most other management measures than less specialized anglers. Regardless of specialization, anglers were largely unaware of the risks and tradeoffs inherent to stock enhancement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An improved efficient biochemical detection method to marine toxins with a smartphone-based portable system-Bionic e-Eye,"Su, KQ; Qiu, XX; Fang, JR; Zou, QC; Wang, P","It is an undeniable fact that the effect of marine toxins becomes increasingly serious to people. Paralytic shellfish poisons (PSP) are well-known sodium channel-blocking marine toxins, which block the conduction of nerve impulses and lead to a series of neurological disorders symptoms. Similarly, as inhibitors of serine/threonine protein phosphatases type 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A), diarrheic shellfish poisons (DSP) can destroy cytoskeleton and affect intracellular signal transduction, which causes some symptoms of gastrointestinal food allergy. Since the conventional methods to detect marine toxins had some disadvantages (e.g., complicated pretreatment, time-consuming detection, huge instruments and off-site test), bionic electronic eye (Bionic e-Eye) was designed and studied for the in-field fast measurement and real-time on-line analysis to marine toxins. Bionic e-Eye installed the homemade software-iPlate and completed the integration of image acquisition and further data processing. With the cooperation of ELISA, Bionic e-Eye used two color models-HSV and RGB to evaluate its bioanalytical performance in saxitoxin (STX) assay and okadaic acid (OA), which were the standard representations of PSP and DSP, respectively. Moreover, the microtiter plate reader (MTPR) was compared with Bionic e-Eye in the detection of marine toxins. The results demonstrated that Bionic e-Eye using saturation had the comparable precision, dynamic range, detection limit and sensitivity to MTPR in the two assays. Therefore, Bionic e-Eye has great potential to be a field-test platform and becomes the supplement of conventional off-site detection methods in measurement domain of marine toxins.

Body mass index and waist circumference as predictors of all-cause mortality in an Aboriginal Australian community,"Adegbija, O; Hoy, WE; Dong, B; Wang, ZQ","Objective: Although elevated body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) have been identified as risk factors for mortality, data from the Australian Aboriginal communities are scarce. This study examined the associations of BMI and WC with all-cause mortality in an Australian Aboriginal community.Methods: A total of 934 Aboriginal adults, aged 18-76 years, who participated in a community-wide screening programme in Australia's Northern Territory from 1992 to 1998, were followed-up prospectively for up to 18 years for death outcomes. The hazard ratios for mortality were estimated by baseline BMI and WC. Age, sex, smoking and alcohol consumption status were adjusted for in multivariable analysis.Results: In 14,750 person-years of follow-up, 216 deaths were recorded. For each standard deviation increase in BMI, the risk of all-cause death decreased by 9% (95% CI: 0.80-1.05); whereas for each SD increase in WC, the risk of all-cause mortality increased by 17% (95% CI: 1.03-1.33). The risk of mortality was lower in the 3rd BMI tertile compared to the 1st tertile for mortality after adjusting for WC, age, sex, smoking and alcohol consumption. Risk of death was higher in WC tertile 3 compared to tertile 1 after adjusting for BMI, age, sex, smoking and alcohol consumption.Conclusions: The risk of all-cause mortality among participants increased with higher WC, while participants with relatively higher BMI had a lower mortality risk. WC had stronger association with mortality than did BMI. The results indicate the importance of assessing WC measures in studies conducted in Aboriginal Australia.

Patients' quality of life, physical function and physical activity level were assessed at baseline and after 16 weeks.Results: Almost only women were willing to enrol in the study. Participants of the intervention group significantly improved their quality of life (p=0.023), and particularly self-esteem (p = 0.014). However, dance therapy added to a patient educational program did not produce statistically significant higher effects than a patient education program alone on functional capacities and patients' physical activity level.Conclusion: A 16 week structured patient educational program combined with dance therapy seems to have a positive effect on the quality of life of obese people, but no effect on functional capacities and physical activity.

An Evaluation of Deep Water Navigation Systems for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles,"Costanzi, R; Fenucci, D; Giagnoni, S; Munafo, A; Caiti, A","The navigation system is a crucial element of the control chain of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) because of the unavailability of a reliable positioning system such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). High performance navigation capabilities are ensured by equipping vehicles with high grade INS (Inertial Navigation System) aided by a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) among other sensors. For its nature, a DVL can work only within a limited range from the bottom precluding its use for deep water applications. This work analyses two different approaches to address the problem of deep water navigation. The first one is based on measurements of relative distance between different nodes (cooperating vehicles and a static gateway buoy) that constitute an acoustic underwater network. The second one is based on the data from a positioning system (the HiPAP system by Kongsberg) that is mounted on the support ship and that has a limited operational range. Results from the two approaches are evaluated based on the data collected during the COLLAB NGAS14 experimental campaign and processed off-line. The results have to be intended as a preliminary work towards the integration of several complementary methods within a unique navigation system capable of exploiting the different technologies towards robust and reliable deep water navigation capabilities.

Visualizing Our Options for Coastal Places: Exploring Realistic Immersive Geovisualizations as Tools for Inclusive Approaches to Coastal Planning and Management,"Newell, R; Canessa, R; Sharma, T","Effective coastal planning is inclusive and incorporates the variety of user needs, values and interests associated with coastal environments. Realistic, immersive geographic visualizations, i.e., geovisualizations, can serve as potentially powerful tools for facilitating such planning because they can provide diverse groups with vivid understandings of how they would feel about certain management outcomes or impacts if transpired in real places. However, the majority of studies in this area have focused on terrestrial environments, and research on applications of such tools in the coastal and marine contexts is in its infancy. The current study aims to advance such research by examining the potential a land-to-sea geovisualization has to serve as a tool for inclusive coastal planning efforts. The research uses Sidney Spit Park (BC, Canada) as a study site, and a realistic, dynamic geovisualization of the park was developed (using Unity3D) that allows users to interact with and navigate it through the first-person perspective. Management scenarios were developed based on discussions with Parks Canada, and these scenarios included fencing around vegetation areas, positioning of mooring buoys, and management of dog activity within the park. Scenarios were built into the geovisualization in a manner that allows users to toggle different options. Focus groups were then assembled, involving residents of the Capital Regional District (BC, Canada), and participants explored and provided feedback on the scenarios. Findings from the study demonstrate the geovisualization's usefulness for assessing certain qualities of scenarios, such as aesthetics and functionality of fencing options and potential viewshed impacts associated with different mooring boat locations. In addition, the study found that incorporating navigability into the geovisualization proved to be valuable for understanding scenarios that hold implications for the marine environment due to user ability to cross the land-sea interface and experience underwater places. Furthermore, this research demonstrated that building scenarios within a realistic geovisualization required modeling place-based characteristics (including soundscape) as well as spatial properties. This approach can allow users the ability to more comprehensively assess scenarios and consider potential options.",2017,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,4,,,WOS:000457690600288,10.3389/fmars.2017.00290,,#20157,Newell 2017,,
"Fish Consumption, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease","Rhee, JJ; Kim, E; Buring, JE; Kurth, T","Introduction: Data on omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in relation to cardiovascular disease are limited in women. The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal relations of tuna and dark fish, alpha-linolenic acid, and marine omega-3 fatty acid intake with incident major cardiovascular disease in women.Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of U.S. women participating in the Women's Health Study from 1993 to 2014, during which the data were collected and analyzed. A total of 39,876 women who were aged >= 45 years and free of cardiovascular disease at baseline provided dietary data on food frequency questionnaires. Analyses used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between fish and energy-adjusted omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake and the risk of major cardiovascular disease, defined as a composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death, in 38,392 women in the final analytic sample (96%).Results: During 713,559 person years of follow-up, 1,941 cases of incident major cardiovascular disease were confirmed. Tuna and dark fish intake was not associated with the risk of incident major cardiovascular disease (p-trend >0.05). Neither alpha-linolenic acid nor marine omega-3 fatty acid intake was associated with major cardiovascular disease or with individual cardiovascular outcomes (all p-trend >0.05). There was no effect modification by age, BMI, or baseline history of hypertension.Conclusions: In this cohort of women without history of cardiovascular disease, intakes of tuna and dark fish, alpha-linolenic acid, and marine omega-3 fatty acids were not associated with risk of major cardiovascular disease.

Manifold methods for assimilating geophysical and meteorological data in Earth system models and their components,"Safaie, A; Dang, C; Qiu, H; Radha, H; Phanikumar, MS","A novel manifold method of reconstructing dynamically evolving spatial fields is presented for assimilating data from sensor networks in integrated land surface - subsurface, oceanic/lake models. The method was developed based on the assumption that data can be mapped onto an underlying differential manifold. In this study, the proposed method was used to reconstruct meteorological forcing over Lake Michigan, the bathymetry of an inland lake (Gull Lake), and precipitation over the Grand River watershed in Michigan. In the first case study, hourly meteorological forcing data were reconstructed and used to run a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of Lake Michigan and to quantify the improvement that results from the use of the new method. In the second example, the bathymetry of Gull Lake was reconstructed from measured scatter point data using the manifold technique. A hydrodynamic model of Gull Lake was developed and refined using the improved bathymetry. In the last case study, improved daily participation data for a six-year period over the Grand River watershed were used as input to an integrated, distributed hydrologic model. All three examples illustrate the superior performance of the manifold method over standard methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results also indicate that using the cross-validation technique to evaluate the performance of data reconstruction methods can lead to misleading conclusions about their relative performance.

Attractiveness of the United States as a travel destination for the Russian tourist in the era of strained bilateral relations,"Stepchenkova, S; Shichkova, E","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the attractiveness of a global tourism destination when the country of that destination and the country that provides the source market are in a situation of political and economic conflict. In this study, the USA is the vacation destination, and Russia is the tourismgenerating region.Design/methodology/approach - In May 2015, 18 Russian tourists from a large regional urban center participated in qualitative semi-structured interviews. The interviews took place in the situational context of strained bilateral relations between the USA and Russia over events in Ukraine, Crimea, and Donbass, as well as economic sanctions that had been in effect for almost a year at the time of the interviews.Findings - Respondents expressed substantial interest in vacationing in the USA despite their strong disagreement with USA international policies. While domestic tourism offerings were evaluated as inferior to those of other international destinations, patriotic sentiments with respect to domestic tourism were registered.Practical implications - Brand USA is still very attractive to the potential tourists, especially such components as major cities, entertainment, oceans, beaches and resorts, as well as the vastness of its national parks. The absence of information with respect to travel to USA was noticed by all respondents.Originality/value - The study is conducted in a situation of ongoing conflict between the two countries and explores how the feelings of animosity toward the USA influence the desire of Russian tourists to vacation in the USA.",2017,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM CITIES,3,1,87-101,WOS:000401033000007,10.1108/IJTC-10-2016-0047,,#20160,Stepchenkova 2017,,
COLUMN SLAMMING LOADS ON A TLP FROM STEEP AND BREAKING WAVES,"ASME; Vestbostad, TM; Okland, OD; Lian, G; Stavang, TP","Previous model test campaigns of various large-volume platforms indicate that wave impact loads on vertical platform columns can become high in extreme sea states. Column slamming is a highly non-linear and complex problem and reliable estimation' of Ultimate Limit State (ULS) and Accidental Limit State (ALS) design loads is a challenge. Previous measurements indicate ALS pressures of about 3 MPa acting on an area of typically 50 m(2) in North Sea and Norwegian Sea wave conditions. The corresponding ULS loads were in the range 1.5-2.0 MPa for the same impact area. Such high predictions for ULS and ALS impact pressures may be critical for both steel and concrete platforms, and accurate predictions of design loads is therefore crucial to establish the correct level of safety.A model test campaign dedicated to investigate column slamming has been performed on the Heidrun platform, a large concrete Tension Leg Platform (TLP). The column diameter is 31 m. The test campaign was performed in 2013 at Marintek (now Sintef Ocean), at a model scale of 1:55. The main objective of the test campaign was to estimate the characteristic slamming loads, defined as the q-annual extreme 3-hour slamming load level of 10 for the Ultimate Limit State (ULS) and 10(-4) for the Accidental Limit State (ALS).To ascertain that the test campaign would result in reliable load estimates, a pre-study on column slamming was performed, involving a selected expert group with participants from several organizations. Review of previous work, identification of governing parameters for wave impact and assessment of model uncertainties and extreme value prediction of slamming loads was performed. It was concluded that two challenges were to be specifically addressed during the planning and execution of the test: 1) the localized nature and short duration of the slamming loads and 2) the large statistical variability of the slamming loads. To address the first challenge, special focus was given to the extent and quality of the instrumentation capturing the slamming loads. Comprehensive documentation of the instrumentation was also performed using hammer testing, structural analysis and drop tests. The second challenge was addressed with a carefully planned test strategy. The resulting model test campaign set a new standard for model testing of such loads, using over 80 slamming panels with a sampling frequency of 19.2 kHz, and over 300 sea state realizations.This paper presents the planning and execution of the model test campaign, including the instrumentation and model set-up, the test matrix, main challenges, findings and results.",2017,,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 36TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OCEAN, OFFSHORE AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING, 2017, VOL 1",,,,WOS:000417224400064,,,#20161,ASME 2017,,
From science to action: Principles for undertaking environmental research that enables knowledge exchange and evidence-based decision-making,"Cvitanovic, C; McDonald, J; Hobday, AJ","Effective conservation requires knowledge exchange among scientists and decision-makers to enable learning and support evidence-based decision-making. Efforts to improve knowledge exchange have been hindered by a paucity of empirically-grounded guidance to help scientists and practitioners design and implement research programs that actively facilitate knowledge exchange. To address this, we evaluated the Ningaloo Research Program (NRP), which was designed to generate new scientific knowledge to support evidence-based decisions about the management of the Ningaloo Marine Park in north-western Australia. Specifically, we evaluated (1) outcomes of the NRP, including the extent to which new knowledge informed management decisions; (2) the barriers that prevented knowledge exchange among scientists and managers; (3) the key requirements for improving knowledge exchange processes in the future; and (4) the core capacities that are required to support knowledge exchange processes. While the NRP generated expansive and multidisciplinary science outputs directly relevant to the management of the Ningaloo Marine Park, decision-makers are largely unaware of this knowledge and little has been integrated into decision-making processes. A range of barriers prevented efficient and effective knowledge exchange among scientists and decision-makers including cultural differences among the groups, institutional barriers within decision-making agencies, scientific outputs that were not translated for decision-makers and poor alignment between research design and actual knowledge needs. We identify a set of principles to be implemented routinely as part of any applied research program, including; (i) stakeholder mapping prior to the commencement of research programs to identify all stakeholders, (ii) research questions to be co-developed with stakeholders, (iii) implementation of participatory research approaches, (iv) use of a knowledge broker, and (v) tailored knowledge management systems. Finally, we articulate the individual, institutional and financial capacities that must be developed to underpin successful knowledge exchange strategies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

A systematic quantitative review of coastal and marine cultural ecosystem services: Current status and future research,"Martin, CL; Momtaz, S; Gaston, T; Moltschaniwskyj, NA","Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are the non-material benefits obtained from ecosystems that contribute to human well-being. They are often under-represented in ecosystem services assessments due to difficulties identifying and valuing intangible attributes. This risks a lack of understanding and consideration of CES by decision-makers. A systematic review was done on coastal and marine CES to identify: geographic distribution of research; effective methods for assessing CES; specific habitats/ecosystems that supply CES; subcategories most frequently addressed; and knowledge gaps. Results revealed limited information exists about coastal and marine CES. There is a disparity in the global distribution of studies with little knowledge about CES in developing countries, as well as a disparity within developed countries; with most research undertaken in Europe and North America. There is a dearth of information on CES derived from specific coastal and marine habitats/ecosystems, reflecting a poor understanding of socio-ecological relationships and the different values people assign to these areas. There is a need to develop indicators with the capacity to measure and track changes in CES over time. Participatory approaches using qualitative methods were most effective in identifying CES; however, these lacked a deliberative element that would provide a comprehensive assessment of shared values in public areas. Overall, publications typically theorised about the usefulness of data on CES to inform and support decision makers, and more research is required on how qualitative data on CES can be represented for practical use by coastal and marine resource managers, and the value of these in the real world.

COOPERATIVE FEDERALISM IN BISCAYNE NATIONAL PARK,"Stoa, RB","Biscayne National Park is the largest marine national park in the United States. It contains four distinct ecosystems, encompasses 173,000 acres (only five percent of which are land), and is located within densely populated Miami-Dade County. The bay has a rich history of natural resource utilization, but aggressive residential and industrial development schemes prompted Congress to create Biscayne National Monument in 1968, followed by the designation of Biscayne National Park in 1980. When the dust settled, Florida retained key management powers over the Park, including joint authority over fishery management.States and the federal government occasionally share responsibility for regulating natural resources, but Biscayne National Park represents a unique case study in cooperative federalism. This article explores these cooperative federalism contours in order to assess whether the park's management paradigm provides a model worthy of replication. A diverse range of materials were reviewed for this project, including literature and jurisprudence on traditional models of cooperative federalism, federal natural resources laws, national park regulations and policy, Biscayne National Park's statutory frameworks and legislative history, state and federal management plans, inter-agency communications, and direct stakeholder interviews.These materials combine to tell a story of cooperative federalism that has been frustrating and, at times, incoherent. But the story also demonstrates that shared responsibility over fishery management has produced beneficial results for the Park and its stakeholders by forcing state and federal officials to work together on planning and enforcement, diversifying human and financial resources, and incorporating federal, state, and local interests into park management and policy. The research suggests that future applications of the Biscayne National Park model of cooperative federalism, in which states and the federal government share joint authority over marine resources in some capacity, may enjoy similar success.",2016,,NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL,56,1,81-115,WOS:000393604100006,,,#20164,Stoa 2016,,
Doing the counter-regulation shuffle: The importance of flexibility and hunger for predicting food consumption following a preload,"Broadbent, J; Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, M; Dennerstein, M; Greenwood, J; Hancock, N; Thavapalan, N; White, M","Objectives: This study utilised the preload paradigm to evaluate whether trait-like dieting attitudes and behaviours (dietary restraint and flexibility in dieting rules) and context-specific factors (negative mood and hunger) predict food consumption among male and female participants.Methods: Following a high calorie preload, 79 participants aged 18-40 completed a deceptive taste test in which they were encouraged to eat as much of the taste test foods as desired, and this ad libitum intake was measured.Results: Although each predictor (except negative mood) predicted consumption when tested individually, regression analyses revealed that dieting flexibility and current hunger were the strongest unique predictors of intake. Mood failed to directly predict food consumption, nor did it moderate the relationship between restraint and food intake.Conclusion: Collectively, findings suggest that emphasis on dietary restraint in preload studies may be misplaced, as other proximal and stable factors may better predict food consumption.

High or low intensity text-messaging combined with group treatment equally promote weight loss maintenance in obese adults,"Zwickert, K; Rieger, E; Swinbourne, J; Manns, C; McAulay, C; Gibson, AA; Sainsbury, A; Caterson, ID","Background: Text-message and e-mail are emerging as potential methods for improving weight outcomes among obese individuals. The optimal volume, frequency, and timing of such interventions are unknown. This study investigated the effect of adjunct technological support on weight and psychological variables after a 3-month cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) group intervention.Methods: Sixty obese adults were randomised to a CBT programme plus intensive (text-message and e-mail; CBT + ITS) or minimal (text-message only; CBT + MTS) technological support. Assessments occurred at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 15-months. Outcome variables included weight (kg), body mass index (kg/m(2)), waist circumference (cm), binge-eating tendencies, weight self-efficacy, and weight control cognitions and behaviours.Results: CBT + ITS (n = 31) and CBT + MTS (n = 29) participants lost 5.2% (+/- 1.1) and 4.7% (+/- 1.1) of their baseline weight by 3- months, 8.4% (+/- 1.2) and 6.4% (+/- 1.1) by 6- months, 9.6% (+/- 1.3) and 6.4% (+/- 1.3) by 9-months, and sustained a 7.5% (+/- 1.3) and 5.1% (+/- 1.3) loss at 15-months, respectively. There were no significant differences between intensive and minimal support, however, the CBT + ITS group showed a marginal advantage across all anthropometric measures.Conclusions: A low intensity text-message support programme is just as effective as higher intensity technological support for maintaining weight loss in obese adults. This represents a low-cost means of aiding weight loss maintenance without reliance on extended face-to-face treatment.

Low-level methylmercury exposure through rice ingestion in a cohort of pregnant mothers in rural China,"Hong, C; Yu, XD; Liu, JH; Cheng, Y; Rothenberg, SE","Background: Rice ingestion is an important dietary exposure pathway for methylmercury. There are few studies concerning prenatal methylmercury exposure through rice ingestion, yet the health risks are greatest to the developing fetus, and thus should be investigated.Objectives: Our main objective was to quantify dietary methylmercury intake through rice and fish/shellfish ingestion among pregnant mothers living in southern China, where rice was a staple food and mercury contamination was considered minimal.Methods: A total of 398 mothers were recruited at parturition, who donated scalp hair and blood samples. Total mercury and/or methylmercury concentrations were measured in biomarkers, in rice samples from each participant's home, and in fish tissue purchased from local markets. Additional fish/shellfish mercury concentrations were obtained from a literature search. Dietary methylmercury intake during the third trimester was equivalent to the ingestion rate for rice (or fish/shellfish) x the respective methylmercury concentration.Results: Dietary methylmercury intake from both rice and fish/shellfish ingestion averaged 1.2 +/- 1.8 mu g/day (median=0.79 mu g/day, range=0-22 mu g/day), including on average 71% from rice ingestion (median: 87%, range: 0-100%), and 29% from fish/shellfish consumption (median 13%, range: 0-100%). Median concentrations of hair total mercury, hair methylmercury, and blood total mercury were 0.40 mu g/g (range: 0.08-1.7 mu g/g), 0.28 mu g/g (range: 0.01-1.4 mu g/g), and 1.2 mu g/L (range: 0.29-8.6 mu g/L), respectively, and all three biomarkers were positively correlated with dietary methylmercury intake through rice ingestion (Spearman's rho=0.18-0.21, p <= 0.0005), although the correlations were weak. In contrast, biomarkers were not correlated with fish/shellfish methylmercury intake (Spearman's rho=0.04-0.08, p = 0.11-0.46).Conclusions: Among pregnant mothers living in rural inland China, rice ingestion contributed to prenatal methylmercury exposure, more so than fish/shellfish ingestion.

Relations between professional groups in the Atlantic and Mediterranean fishing enclaves of Andalusia (Spain): A personal networks approach with clustered graphs,"Maya-Jariego, I; Ramos, DH; del Corral, DF","This paper proposes a new network-based approach to analyse intergroup relations in fishing ports. The technique of clustered graphs is applied to the case of the Andalusian fishing ports to assess the balance betweeh intra and inter-professional relationships. The patterns of sociability in Mediterranean and Atlantic fishing enclaves in the southern region of Spain were compared, examining their implications for participatory governance of marine resources. The personal networks of 53 fishermen, ship owners or skippers and key individuals of 18 Andalusian fisheries were analysed. The personal networks were compared in terms of fishing ground (Atlantic versus Mediterranean) and port type (by size and form of participation). The data of 45 individuals with whom each respondent usually interacts in the harbour was summarised in clustered graphs of intra-group and inter-group relationships between 8 professional roles in the harbour. Results show primarily that personal networks of Mediterranean ports are overall denser, in comparison with those of the Atlantic, which are more centralised and have a higher average betweenness. Secondly, in the Atlantic a clear difference of roles between ship owners and skippers is observed. A strong link between ship owners and the crew was found, and also between the ship owner and commercial roles in the Mediterranean. Small ports seem to be more apt for the artisanalisation of fisheries, as well as for the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Estuarine habitats structure zooplankton communities: Implications for the pelagic trophic pathways,"David, V; Selleslagh, J; Nowaczyk, A; Dubois, S; Bachelet, G; Blanchet, H; Gouillieux, B; Lavesque, N; Leconte, M; Savoye, N; Sautour, B; Lobry, J","Estuarine ecosystems have been described as a mosaic of habitats exhibiting different physical, biological and chemical properties and processes. These habitats are of primary importance for fishes, providing refuges and/or food for juveniles. While it is well known that habitats contribute also to the structuration of meio- and macrobenthic assemblages, this concept of habitat has never been associated to zooplankton communities, a major food resource for many pelagic fishes during summer in North European estuaries. The objective of this work was thus to assess if estuarine habitats, in addition to the salinity gradient, structured zooplankton communities as well. Sampling was conducted at high tide during summer in a highly turbid system, the Gironde estuary, for which primary production and thus food resource at the basis of the food web is strongly limited. The results showed that even if the upstream-downstream estuarine gradient was the main factor structuring zooplankton at the scale of the estuary, there was a significant difference of zooplankton assemblages between samples collected over subtidal areas and those collected over intertidal areas. More particularly, the estuarine gradient was associated to the distribution pattern of species while difference between subtidal and intertidal samples were mainly due to difference in the level of abundance of species. Stable isotope analysis revealed that these zooplanktonic omnivorous species may be attracted to intertidal mudflats by microphytobenthos availability and that some planktivorous fishes, in particular Alosa fallax, preferentially fed on this zone. The role of intertidal habitats in structuring zooplankton assemblages suggests that this habitat strongly participates to the production of planktivorous species and that it represents a biotic vector of carbon resources toward subtidal areas. The loss of tidal flats habitats could thus have consequences on the functioning of pelagic system as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Association between dietary patterns and metabolic syndrome in a sample of Tehranian adults,"Farhangi, MA; Jahangiry, L; Asghari-Jafarabadi, M; Najafi, M","Aim: Metabolic syndrome is one of the most known risk factors of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the current study was to investigate relationships between major dietary patterns and cardio-metabolic risk factors in patients with metabolic syndrome.Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients with metabolic syndrome. All of the participants underwent anthropometric and blood pressure measurements. Biochemical assessments including serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), fating serum glucose (FSG), serum lipids, insulin and adiponectin concentrations were performed by enzymatic methods. Dietary patterns were obtained by factor analysis procedure using principal component method. Nutrient intakes were analyzed by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).Results: Four major dietary patterns including healthy, meats and fats, sweets, potatoes and refined grains were extracted in the current study. Higher healthy pattern score was in relation with higher concentrations of AST and lower systolic blood pressure. Lower diastolic blood pressure and higher serum triglyceride concentrations were also observed in upper quintiles of meat and fats pattern (P < 0.05). Upper quintile of sweet pattern was accompanied with higher serum FSG and insulin concentrations (P < 0.05).Conclusions: The independent associations between dietary patterns and blood pressure and serum lipids further support the protective role of healthy diet with fruits, vegetables and fish as predominant food items and an un-favorable effect of unhealthy diets with meat, fats and sweets as major ingredients.

Artisanal fishery versus port activity in southern Brazil,"Oliveira, PD; Di Beneditto, APM; Bulhoes, EMR; Zappes, CA","The objective of this study is to describe the artisanal fishery practices in the community of Farol de Sao Tome in Campos dos Goytacazes city, north of the state of Rio de Janeiro. We aim to analyze the perception of artisanal fishermen and their families in relation to activities of Logistic Industrial Complex of Farol-Barra do Furado (CLIFABA) and to evaluate the conditions of fishery maintenance together with the port activities. Between 2014 and 2015, we conducted 90 ethnographic interviews with fishermen (30), spouses of fishermen (30) and children of fishermen (30). The fishermen are mostly male, all the spouses are female, here denominated as 'wives', and the children are male and female. In this region, the artisanal fishery is practiced in the marine environment with trawler boats and involves the use of nets, mainly bottom trawl, fishing lines and traps. Due to the absence of a mooring, tractors are used to launch and remove boats from the sea. Regarding the future of the artisanal fishery together with CLIFABA activities, the fishermen affirm that the fishery will ultimately end (37%; n = 11). The wives (40%; n = 12) and children of fishermen (43%; n = 13) believe that with the movement of ships during the activities of CLIFABA, the coastal marine fauna can disappear, ultimately changing the dynamics of fisheries in the region. As a solution to the interference of CLIFABA in the artisanal fishery, the interviewees suggest the repeal of restrictions related to fishery activities, as well as the ability of fishermen to work along any area of the coastline.

Self-weighing in weight management interventions: A systematic review of literature,"Shieh, C; Knisely, MR; Clark, D; Carpenter, JS","Background: Self-weighing increases a person's self-awareness of current weight and weight patterns. Increased self-weighing frequency can help an individual prevent weight gain. Literature, however, is limited in describing variability in self-weighing strategies and how the variability is associated with weight management outcomes.Aim: This review analyzed self-weighing in weight management interventions and the effects of self-weighing on weight and other outcomes.Methods: Twenty-two articles from PubMed, CINAHL, Medline, Psychlnfo, and Academic Search Premier were extracted for review.Results: These 22 articles reported findings from 19 intervention trials, mostly on weight loss or weight gain prevention. The majority of the reviewed articles reported interventions that combined self-weighing with other self-monitoring strategies (64%), adopted daily self-weighing frequency (84%), and implemented interventions up to six months (59%). One-half of the articles mentioned that technology-enhanced or regular weight scales were given to study participants. Of the articles that provided efficacy data, 75% of self-weighing-only interventions and 67% of combined interventions demonstrated improved weight outcomes. No negative psychological effects were found.Conclusions: Self-weighing is likely to improve weight outcomes, particularly when performed daily or weekly, without causing untoward adverse effects. Weight management interventions could consider including this strategy. (C) 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Disordered eating behaviours and food insecurity: A qualitative study about children with obesity in low-income households,"Tester, JM; Lang, TC; Laraia, BA","Background: While there is information in the literature describing the poor nutritional intake of food-insecure youth, eating behaviours among food-insecure children - particularly, obese children are less well-described. We conducted focus groups with family members of low-income children who were initiating care in a paediatric obesity clinic. Food hiding emerged as a theme, and generated the motivation for this analysis.Methods: Between April 2012 and December 2013, a total of 7 focus groups were conducted (4 food-insecure groups and 3 food-secure). Based on recruitment from 37 index patients, the focus groups were attended by a total of 47 participants. Participant responses about eating behaviours were evaluated using a combination of inductive codes derived from the data and deductive codes informed by criteria for diagnosis of disordered eating.Results: While participants from food-secure and food-insecure households all had anecdotes about their children overeating, respondents in two of the food-insecure groups described episodes that resemble binge eating. The topic of hiding food emerged in the food-insecure groups, though was not endorsed in the food-secure groups despite probing. Night-time eating arose spontaneously in two of the food insecure groups, but not in the food-secure groups.Conclusion: This study highlights the presence of food hiding, binge eating, and night-time eating in food-insecure children with obesity. These factors would further compound their health burden, and the relationship between disordered eating and food insecurity in children with obesity warrants further study.

The effect of body weight on distal airway function and airway inflammation,"van de Kant, KDG; Paredi, P; Meah, S; Kalsi, HS; Barnes, PJ; Usmani, OS","Background/Objectives: Obesity is a global health problem that adversely influences the respiratory system. We assessed the effects of body mass index (BMI) on distal airway function and airway inflammation.Subjects/Methods: Impulse oscillometry (IOS) as a measure of distal airway function, together with spirometry, were assessed in adults with a range of different BMIs. Airway inflammation was assessed with the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and participants exhaled at various exhalation flows to determine alveolar and bronchial NO.Results: In total 34 subjects were enrolled in the study; 19 subjects had a normal BMI (18.50-24.99), whilst 15 subjects were overweight (BMI 25.00-29.99), or obese (BMI >= 30). All subjects had normal spirometry. However, IOS measures of airway resistance (R) at 5 Hz, 20 Hz and frequency dependence (R5-20) were elevated in overweight/obese individuals, compared to subjects with a normal BMI (median (interquartile range)); 5 Hz: 0.41 (0.37, 0.45) vs. 0.32 (0.30, 0.37) kPa/l/s; 20 Hz: 0.34 (0.30, 0.37) vs. 0.30 (0.26, 0.33) kPa/l/s; R5-20: 0.06 (0.04, 0.11) vs. 0.03 (0.01, 0.05) kPa/l/s; p < 0.05), whereas airway reactance at 20 Hz was decreased in overweight/obese individuals (20 Hz: 0.07 (0.03, 0.09) vs. 0.10 (0.07, 0.13) kPa/l/s, p = 0.009; 5Hz: -0.12 (-0.15, -0.10) vs. -0.10 (-0.13, -0.09) kPa/l/s, p = 0.07). In contrast, within-breath IOS measures (a sign of expiratory flow limitation) and FeNO inflammatory measures, did not differ between groups (p > 0.05).Conclusions: Being overweight has significant effects on distal and central airway function as determined by IOS, which is not detected by spirometry. Obesity does not influence airway inflammation as measured by FeNO. IOS is a reliable technique to identify airway abnormalities in the presence of normal spirometry in overweight people.

Quantitative analysis of anthropogenic influences on coastal water - A new perspective,"Cai, MG; Liu, Y; Chen, K; Huang, DR; Yang, SY","Coastal environment has been disturbed by human activities for a long time, especially in the rapidly urbanizing and industrializing areas. Although the surrounding area has achieved great economic success in the past 30 years, Western Xiamen Bay (China) is seriously affected by pollutants and is facing increasing ecological pressure. Because of this, Xiamen was selected in 1994 as a demonstration site for implementing an integrated coastal management program, which included a series of measures for protecting the coastal environment. However, coastal environment is dynamic, complex and site-specific, and thus a scientific quantitative evaluation framework is necessary for environment quality analysis and effective coastal management. In this study, we used oceanographic knowledge together with quantitative methods (Bai-Perron's structural break test) to analyze the long-term variations of water quality indices (pH, DO, COD, DIN, PO4-P and Oil) in Western Xiamen Bay. In addition, we compared with other coastal areas to identify the effectiveness of phosphorus-based nutrient management measures and predicted the probable variation trend in the future. The results show that in Western Xiamen Bay: (1) the concentrations of DO and Oil in seawater are effectively controlled by local coastal management measures; (2) seawater acidification will continue to worsen based on the present situation; and (3) the P-limitation treatment strategies are effective and PO4-P concentration starts to fall according to the multiple statistical analysis and Environmental Kuznets Curve. This paper hopes to provide an epitome of the conflicts and consolations between socioeconomic development and environmental quality in the past, and hints for coastal management in the future.

Preferred conservation policies of shark researchers,"Shiffman, DS; Hammerschlag, N","There is increasing concern about the conservation status of sharks. However, the presence of numerous different (and potentially mutually exclusive) policies complicates management implementation and public understanding of the process. We distributed an online survey to members of the largest professional shark and ray research societies to assess member knowledge of and attitudes toward different conservation policies. Questions covered society member opinions on conservation and management policies, personal histories of involvement in advocacy and management, and perceptions of the approach of conservation nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to shark conservation. One hundred and two surveys were completed (overall response rate 21%). Respondents considered themselves knowledgeable about and actively involved in conservation and management policy; a majority believed scientists have a responsibility to advocate for conservation (75%), and majorities have sent formal public comments to policymakers (54%) and included policy suggestions in their papers (53%). They believe sustainable shark fisheries are possible, are currently happening today (in a few places), and should be the goal instead of banning fisheries. Respondents were generally less supportive of newer limit-based (i.e., policies that ban exploitation entirely without a species-specific focus) conservation policy tools, such as shark sanctuaries and bans on the sale of shark fins, than of target-based fisheries management tools (i.e., policies that allow for sustainable harvest of species whose populations can withstand it), such as fishing quotas. Respondents were generally supportive of environmental NGO efforts to conserve sharks but raised concerns about some NGOs that they perceived as using incorrect information and focusing on the wrong problems. Our results show there is an ongoing debate in shark conservation and management circles relative to environmental policy on target-based natural resources management tools versus limit-based conservation tools. They also suggest that closer communication between the scientific and environmental NGO communities may be needed to recognize and reconcile differing values and objectives between these groups.Las Politicas de Conservacion Preferidas por los Investigadores de Tiburones Existe una preocupacion creciente sobre el estado de conservacion de los tiburones. Sin embargo, la presencia de numerosas politicas diferentes (y potencialmente mutuamente excluyentes) complica la implementacion del manejo y el entendimiento publico del proceso. Distribuimos una encuesta en linea a los miembros de las sociedades mas grandes de investigacion profesional sobre tiburones y rayas para valorar el conocimiento y las actitudes de los miembros hacia las diferentes politicas de conservacion. Las preguntas cubrieron las opiniones de los miembros de las sociedades sobre la conservacion y las politicas de manejo, historias personales de participacion en la defensa y el manejo, y las percepciones de las estrategias de conservacion de tiburones de las organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONGs). Se completaron 102 encuestas (la tasa general de respuesta fue de 21%). Los respondientes se consideraron a si mismos como informados sobre e involucrados activamente en la conservacion y las politicas de manejo; una mayoria creyo que los cientificos tienen la responsabilidad de apoyar a la conservacion (75%) y la mayoria ha enviado comentarios publicos formales a quienes elaboran las politicas (54%) y han incluido sugerencias de politicas en sus articulos (53%). Los respondientes creen que las pesquerias sustentables de tiburones son posibles, que actualmente existen (en unos cuantos lugares) y que deberian ser el objetivo en lugar de prohibirlas. En general, los respondientes dieron menos apoyo a las nuevas herramientas de politicas de conservacion basadas en limites (es decir, politicas que prohiben la explotacion en su totalidad y que no tienen un enfoque especifico de especie), como los santuarios de tiburones y los vetos a la venta de tiburon y aleta de tiburon, que a las herramientas de manejo basadas en pesca enfocada (es decir, politicas que permiten la cosecha sustentable de especies cuyas poblaciones pueden soportarlo), como las cuotas de pesca. Los respondientes en general dieron apoyo a los esfuerzos de las ONGs ambientales por conservar a los tiburones pero despertaron conciencia sobre algunas ONGs que percibieron que usaban informacion incorrecta y se enfocaban en los problemas equivocados. Nuestros resultados muestran que hay un debate continuo en la conservacion de tiburones y los circulos de manejo en relacion a las politicas ambientales de las herramientas de gestion de los recursos naturales por objetivos versus las herramientas de conservacion basadas en los limites. Los resultados tambien sugieren que una comunicacion mas cercana entre las comunidades cientificas y de ONGs ambientales puede ser necesaria para reconocer y reconciliar los valores y objetivos discrepantes entre estos grupos.Resumen",2016,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,30,4,805-815,WOS:000379947700014,10.1111/cobi.12668,,#20177,Shiffman 2016,,
Reproductive history and dietary habits and breast cancer risk in Greenlandic Inuit: a case control study,"Wielsoe, M; Gudmundsdottir, S; Bonefeld-Jorgensen, EC","Background: The incidence of breast cancer in Greenland has increased considerably since 1970. It has been suggested that the previous low incidence is associated with the traditional lifestyle and marine food diet, and that the increase in breast cancer risk may be due to changes to a more westernized diet and lifestyle.Objective: To investigate the relation between food intake, reproductive factors and the risk of breast cancer in Greenlandic Inuit women.Design: A case control study with participants from all regions of Greenland. The sampling was carried out at Dronning Ingrids Hospital in Nuuk, Greenland where all breast cancer cases are treated. The reproductive factors and dietary intake were assessed using a questionnaire completed at enrolment. Student t-test was used to compare group differences for continuous data. Fisher's exact test and Pearson's Chi-square were used to compare distribution frequency of data between groups. Odd ratios (ORs) were obtained using logistic regression. Estimates with a P-value <0.05 were considered significant.Results: Information on reproductive factors and dietary intake was available for 116 participants, 60 breast cancer cases and 56 controls. We found that the risk of having breast cancer was significantly reduced (OR: 0.24 [95% CI 0.09; 0.66]) for the group with >= 3 full-term pregnancies and breastfeeding duration of >= 6 months compared to the group with <= 2 full-term pregnancies and breastfeeding duration of <6 months. We found that intake of fruit and vegetables when analyzed together, significantly reduced breast cancer risk (OR: 0.22 [95% CI 0.05; 0.98]).Conclusions: Higher parity, longer breastfeeding duration and intake of fruit and vegetables were protective factors for breast cancer risk. No clear associations between breast cancer and traditional or other imported food were seen. (C) 2016 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Attitudes towards conservation and fishing interaction with sea turtles in the southeast coast of Brazil,"de Carvalho, RH; Mamede, N; Bastos, RR; de Sousa, BM","In Brazil populations of marine turtles are mainly threatened by fishing, they are accidentally captured in virtually all types of fishing. The rescue of fishing folk wisdom could help reduce these catches. The aim of this study was to discuss the interactions between fishing and sea turtles. From September 2012 to. January 2014 44 fishermen and 7 gatherers were interviewed, in the southern state of Espirito Santo. Ten Questions to build the Index of Positive Attitudes towards the conservation of marine turtles were selected (IPA). The IPA was different between the three cities, indicating different types of interactions in the region, the highest rates were found in Guarapari and smallest in Anchieta, the most important factor being the type of contact with the animal where in Guarapari most respondents were gatherers, while in Anchieta they were net fishermen. There was no significant difference between the IPA for these and for respondents who already participate in environment-related matters. To assess the impacts of bycatch, fishermen using longlines and net gear that offer high risk were considered. More than half reported that marine turtles are frequently caught in nets and longlines, including in some cases the animal being tapped for consumption. Policies to mitigate bycatch and quantify the impact of fishing activities become necessary in the region, as the impact of these activities is threatening the population of sea turtles on site.

The ability of regional coordination and policy integration to produce coherent marine management: Implementing the Marine Strategy Framework Directive in the North-East Atlantic,"Cavallo, M; Elliott, M; Touza, J; Quintino, V","The transboundary nature of the marine environment requires concerted actions among neighbouring countries to improve its quality in an effective way. Coordination at international level is particularly important during the implementation of environmental policies aimed at reducing the widespread pressures derived from activities, such as shipping and fishing. The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims to protect and improve the status of a wide range of ecosystem components with a regional focus, promoting cooperation among countries and integration with other environmental policies. In 2014, the European Commission assessed the level of adequacy, consistency and coherence achieved by Member States during the implementation of the first phase of the MSFD and hence this paper focuses on the cross-border coherence and coordination within one marine region in order to achieve the goals of the Directive. In particular, it identifies and analyses the main differences among the results of the implementation of the first phase of the MSFD across the North-East Atlantic region. This analysis shows that, in general, the use of existing data, methodologies and targets from related environmental policies corresponds to the higher levels of coherence among countries while a limited use of such policies produces less coherence. This suggests that the European Commission, Regional Seas Conventions and Member States should work together to identify the real connection between the MSFD and other policies to make a proper use of existing data and approaches and to harmonise different policy objectives. In particular, the review shows what might be termed a 'paradox of coherence' amongst Member States where coherence of action has to be achieved within a European policy of subsidiarity, the act of Member States having control over the way they implement framework directives. This can be regarded as a fundamental flaw in having a 'Framework Directive' instead of the greater control in a 'Directive'. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Testing visitor produced pictures as a management strategy to study visitor experience qualities - A Swedish marine case study,"Hansen, AS","The aim of this paper is to test how visitor produced pictures can be applied in recreation management in order study, and potentially also monitor, different visitor experience qualities. To support this goal, a case study from Sweden is introduced wherein visitor produced pictures are the main methodological approach. The case study took place during summer 2014 and involved 41 participants who via smart phones took pictures of their important recreational experiences. The results revealed six different categories of experience qualities in the visitor produced pictures: natural elements, social situations, cultural environments, recreational activities, emotional reactions and disturbing factors. These categories are described with special attention to possible management implications and a better understanding of visitor experience qualities. Furthermore, the paper suggests how new technology might be useful for recreation managers. The paper concludes that visitor produced pictures have considerable potential as an informative and efficient strategy to capture and study visitor experience qualities. The development of visual methods as a monitoring approach should therefore receive more attention in recreation management.MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS This paper suggests that recreation managers should base their management actions and activities not only on information such as visitor numbers, profiles and spatial behavior. Furthermore, the paper presents a new opportunity to gather information about important visitor experience qualities. However, doing so involves several management implications, including:An emphasis on the importance of studying visitor experiences in recreation planning and management;An integration of qualitative methodology into recreation management, for instance via visitor produced pictures;An increase in managerial competences and training in the work with social science based, qualitative methodology;An understanding of the need for visitor involvement and the potential in new technology in recreation management;Recognition of the need for more collaboration between managers and researchers, especially concerning manager education.

Postprandial effects of consuming a staggered meal on gut peptide and glycemic responses in obese women and men,"Griffith, L; Haddad, EH; Tonstad, S","Eating slowly by staggering a meal may reduce energy intake. Our aim was to examine the effect of eating a portion of beans 15 min before the rest of the meal, on gastrointestinal (GI) peptides, glucose and insulin concentrations and subsequent energy intake in obese adults. This was a randomised crossover design study with 28 obese subjects. Participants consumed a standardised breakfast on test days followed by test meals: (1) control meal containing 86 g (0.5 cup) of beans, and (2) staggered meal in which 86 g (0.5 cup) of beans were consumed 15 min before the rest of the meal. Blood obtained prior to and at 30, 60, and 120 min following the meals was analysed for acylated ghrelin, unacylated ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY, oxyntomodulin, glucose and insulin. Feelings of hunger and satiety were assessed using analog visual scales. Energy intake following the test meal was obtained by computer assisted dietary recalls. Mixed model statistical analysis of data showed time effects for unacylated ghrelin, GLP-1, glucose, insulin, hunger and fullness, however, meal effects were not shown for any of the parameters. GLP-1 area under the curve from baseline to 120 min (AUC(0-120)) decreased by 19% (P = 0.024) and that of glucose increased by 7% (P=0.046) following the staggered compared to the control bean meal. Energy intake subsequent to the test meals did not differ between treatments. In conclusion, lengthening meal times by staggering eating did not benefit hormonal, metabolic or appetite control in obese individuals. (C) 2015 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

"Marine strategy framework directive: Defining joint monitoring opportunities for the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea, through dedicated decision making workshops and innovative policy tools","Loizidou, XI; Loizides, MI; Orthodoxou, DL","The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) is an important milestone for the preservation of the European marine environment. However, Member States can find its monitoring requirements challenging, particularly where it regards the definition and implementation of joint monitoring programmes between neighbouring countries. The challenges are even greater in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, where many countries are not members of the European Union and where Regional Sea Conventions face greater difficulties in coordinating monitoring activities. This paper presents the results from two regional workshops, within the framework of IRIS-SES project, which aimed to inform policy-and decision -makers in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea on what key stakeholders, including scientists, academia and local authorities, consider the main gaps, needs and opportunities for the MSFD joint monitoring regarding eutrophication and contaminants.

High-resolution SIMS oxygen isotope analysis on conodont apatite from South China and implications for the end-Permian mass extinction,"Chen, J; Shen, SZ; Li, XH; Xu, YG; Joachimski, MM; Bowring, SA; Erwin, DH; Yuan, DX; Chen, B; Zhang, H; Wang, Y; Cao, CQ; Zheng, QF; Mu, L","Understanding the interplay of climatic and biological events in deep time requires resolving the precise timing and pattern of paleotemperature changes and their temporal relationship with carbon cycle variations and biodiversity fluctuations. In situ oxygen isotope analyses of conodont apatite from South China enables us to reconstruct high-resolution seawater temperature records across the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) intervals in the upper slope (Meishan), lower slope (Shangsi), and carbonate platform (Daijiagou and Liangfengya) settings. Constrained by the latest high-precision geochronological dates and high-resolution conodont biozones, we can establish the temporal and spatial patterns of seawater temperature changes and assess their potential connections with the carbon cycle disruption and biodiversity decline. We find a rapid warming of similar to 10 degrees C during the latest Permian-earliest Triassic that postdated the onset of the negative shift in delta C-13(carb) by similar to 81 kyr (thousand years), the abrupt decline in delta C-13(carb) by similar to 32 kyr and the onset of mass extinction by similar to 23 kyr, which contradicts previous claims that the extreme temperature rise started immediately before or coincided with the onset of mass extinction. Our new evidence indicates that climate warming was most likely not a direct cause for the main pulse of the end-Permian mass extinction (EPME), but rather a later participant or a catalyst that increased the pace of the biodiversity decline. In addition, a prominent cooling is recorded in the earliest Changhsingian, with the main phase (a drop of similar to 8 degrees C in similar to 0.2 Ma) confined to the lower part of the Clarkina wangi zone and synchronous with the positive limb of the carbon isotope excursion (CIE) around the Wuchiapingian-Changhsingian boundary (WCB) in Meishan and Shangsi.

Green Marine: An environmental program to establish sustainability in marine transportation,"Walker, TR","European maritime companies have adopted programs to limit operational impacts on the environment. For maritime companies in North America, the Green Marine Environmental Program (GMEP) offers a framework to establish and reduce environmental footprints. Green Marine (GM) participants demonstrate annual improvements of specific environmental performance indicators (e.g., reductions in air pollution emissions) to maintain certification. Participants complete annual self-evaluations with results determining rankings for performance indicators on a 1-to-5 scale. Self-evaluations are independently verified every two years to ensure rigor and individual results are made publicly available annually to achieve transparency. GM benefits the marine industry across North America by encouraging sustainable development initiatives. GM's credibility is reflected through a diverse network of environmental groups and government agencies that endorse and help shape the program.

A study of students' heuristics and strategy patterns in web-based reciprocal peer assessment for science learning,"Tsivitanidou, OE; Constantinou, CP","This study examined the strategies of undergraduate student teachers participating in web-based reciprocal peer-assessment and how they were associated with learning gains in an inquiry-oriented, science learning environment. Twenty-seven participants from a university in Cyprus reciprocally assessed the digital learning products they prepared as they engaged in a web-based study unit on marine ecosystems and in particular prey-predator relationships. Data were collected through screen-video capture, peer feedback protocols, pre and post-instructional tests and interviews, as well as the students' learning products. Data were exposed to qualitative analysis and then also treated quantitatively through the use of non-parametric tests. Our analysis led to the identification of a range of student profiles characterizing different peer-assessment patterns. In the peer-assessor role, students were distinguished into autonomous and informed assessors; whereas in the case of the assessee role they were discriminated into engaged but unlucky, disinterested and engaged assessees. Students' learning gains were associated with their actions as peer-assessees and their attitudes towards peer feedback. The findings have implications for teaching practice as well as policy for teaching and learning in web-based learning environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Quantitative fluorescence kinetic analysis of NADH and FAD in human plasma using three- and four-way calibration methods capable of providing the second-order advantage,"Kang, C; Wu, HL; Zhou, C; Xiang, SX; Zhang, XH; Yu, YJ; Yu, RQ","The metabolic coenzymes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are the primary electron donor and acceptor respectively, participate in almost all biological metabolic pathways. This study develops a novel method for the quantitative kinetic analysis of the degradation reaction of NADH and the formation reaction of FAD in human plasma containing an uncalibrated interferent, by using three-way calibration based on multi-way fluorescence technique. In the three-way analysis, by using the calibration set in a static manner, we directly predicted the concentrations of both analytes in the mixture at any time after the start of their reactions, even in the presence of an uncalibrated spectral interferent and a varying background interferent. The satisfactory quantitative results indicate that the proposed method allows one to directly monitor the concentration of each analyte in the mixture as the function of time in real-time and nondestructively, instead of determining the concentration after the analytical separation. Thereafter, we fitted the first-order rate law to their concentration data throughout their reactions. Additionally, a four-way calibration procedure is developed as an alternative for highly collinear systems. The results of the four-way analysis confirmed the results of the three-way analysis and revealed that both the degradation reaction of NADH and the formation reaction of FAD in human plasma fit the first-order rate law. The proposed methods could be expected to provide promising tools for simultaneous kinetic analysis of multiple reactions in complex systems in real-time and nondestructively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Sustained improvements in fitness and exercise tolerance in obese adolescents after a 12 week exercise intervention,"Gow, ML; van Doorn, N; Broderick, CR; Hardy, LL; Ho, M; Baur, LA; Cowell, CT; Garnett, SP","A 12 week exercise program was evaluated for its effect on aerobic fitness, anaerobic threshold, physical activity and sedentary behavior levels in obese insulin resistant adolescents post intervention and at follow up. 111 obese insulin resistant 10-17 year olds were recruited to a 12 month lifestyle intervention, known as RESIST. From months 4 to 6, adolescents participated in supervised exercise sessions twice per week (45-60 min/session). Aerobic fitness and anaerobic threshold were measured by gas analysis at baseline, 6 months (post intervention) and 12 months (follow up). Self-reported physical activity and sedentary behavior was measured using the CLASS questionnaire. At 6 months aerobic fitness and time to reach the anaerobic threshold had improved by 5.8% [95% CI: 0.8-11.3] and 19.7% [95% CI: 10.4-29.0], respectively compared with baseline. These improvements were maintained at 12 months. Compared to baseline, 6 month physical activity levels increased by 19 min/day [95% CI: 5-33] and screen time decreased by 49 min/ day [95% CI: 23-74] but returned to baseline levels by 12 months. Improved fitness and anaerobic threshold can be sustained up to 6 months following completion of an exercise program possibly enhancing capacity to perform daily functional tasks.

This process resulted in a list of 127 proposed MCZ5 designed to conserve biodiversity and reconcile socioeconomic concerns, however, citing budgetary constraints and evidence-related issues, the UK Government has proceeded with a tranche approach, designating far fewer sites than stakeholders had expected. Concerned with the Government's lack of progress on the MCZ process, Parliament conducted two inquiries, highlighting problems with the Government's approach. In addition, public confidence in the participative process has eroded, with particular despair expressed by participants in the regional projects, who invested considerable time and effort in the site selection process. This outcome has implications not only for the UK's future coastal and marine planning, but also with regard to the implementation of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters. Drawing on interviews with participants in the consultation process, this paper examines the role of stakeholder participation in the UK MCZ site selection process, in particular how well the UK Government implemented its obligations under the Aarhus Convention, and the meaning of ""participation"" in a climate of political change and budgetary constraint.

Assessing the progress in depolluting the Mediterranean Sea,"Spiteri, C; Roddier-Quefelec, C; Giraud, JP; Hema, T","The depollution of the Mediterranean Sea by 2020 is the overarching goal of Horizon 2020 Initiative (H2020). The first phase (2007-2013) tackled the main land-based pollution sources; municipal waste, urban wastewater and industrial emissions. As part of the H2020 roadmap implementation, the ENPI-SEIS project focused on the first H2020 review mechanism that included a) establishing a process for regular environmental reporting in the European Neighbourhood Policy South countries, and b) generating the knowledge necessary to assess the progress in depolluting the Mediterranean Sea. This paper reviews the process in line with the ""Shared Environmental Information System"" principles and its three pillars (content, cooperation, infrastructure). The main outcomes of the thematic assessment, based on a set of regional H2020 indicators, are also presented. This assessment highlights the major drivers and their implications on marine protection. It also identifies areas that require further attention in the next phase of H2020 (2014-2020).

Enhancing public awareness and promoting co-responsibility for marine litter in Europe: The challenge of MARLISCO,"Veiga, JM; Vlachogianni, T; Pahl, S; Thompson, RC; Kopke, K; Doyle, TK; Hartley, BL; Maes, T; Orthodoxou, DL; Loizidou, XI; Alampei, I","Marine litter is a pervasive and complex societal problem but has no simple solution. Inadequate practices at all levels of production-use-disposal contribute to accumulation of waste on land and at sea. Enhanced societal awareness but also co-responsibility across different sectors and improved interactions between stakeholders are necessary.MARLISCO was a European initiative, which developed and implemented activities across 15 countries. It worked towards raising societal awareness and engagement on marine litter, through a combination of approaches: public exhibitions in over 80 locations; a video competition involving 2100 students; and a legacy of educational and decision-supporting tools. 12 national participatory events designed to facilitate dialogue on solutions brought together 1500 stakeholders and revealed support for cross-cutting, preventive measures. Evaluation during implementation shows that these activities are effective in improving individuals' perceptions about the problem but also commitment in being part of the solution.

The relationship between body mass index and periodontitis among postmenopausal women,"Al Habashneh, R; Azar, W; Shaweesh, A; Khader, Y","Background: Periodontitis and overweight/obesity prevalence are both increasing worldwide. Overweight/obesity has been suggested as a risk factor for developing periodontitis. The aim of this study was to determine the association between obesity and periodontitis among postmenopausal Jordanian women.Material and methods: Cross-sectional associations between obesity and periodontitis were examined in 400 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years. All women completed a questionnaire, had a clinical periodontal examination and had their weight and height recorded. Multivariable analysis was carried out using logistic regression with adjustment for possible confounders.Results: Based on body mass index (BMI), 23.5% of the women were considered overweight and 70% were obese. Obese participants with BMI >= 25 had decreased odds (OR) for having periodontitis compared to participants with normal weight (OR: 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-0.87). The obese patients showed significantly higher loss of clinical attachment (CAL), calculus, as well as plaque and gingival index and as compared to normal and overweight (p < 0.01). The extent of periodontal disease was also significantly higher in obese women as measured by average percent of sites with the deepest CAL >= 5 mm (p = 0.025). There was no significant difference in mean and percentage of sites with alveolar crestal bone loss (ACH) among different categories of obesity.In conclusion, BMI may be inversely associated with prevalence of periodontitis but positively related to the severity of periodontitis assessed by several periodontal parameters such as CAL, recession, plaque, and calculus. Additional prospective studies to further quantify, or understand the mechanisms, of this association are merited. (C) 2015 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.

Adventures in cross-disciplinary studies: Grand strategy and fisheries management,"Bailey, J","This article explores whether the ""Grand Strategy"" (GS) approach is useful in the field of fisheries management. GS is derived from the study of warfare and its advocates argue that its lessons can be applied to a wide variety of fields and institutions. This article presents and evaluates the usefulness to fisheries management of five principles recommended by the Yale Grand Strategy program for application in the field of Global Health: (1) start with the ends in mind; (2) take an ecological approach; (3) recognize that tactics matter; (4) use positive deviance to characterize practical solutions and foster scale-up and (5) understand the importance of integrating timely intelligence. It adds a sixth principle, suggested by the literature that prompted the GS approach: always anticipate friction. It argues that while many of the principles offered by the GS approach have long been recognized in fisheries management and closely related fields, GS offers support for these and some new insights. Central among these is the importance of clear policy goals and the lack of natural harmony at various levels of action. The weakness of the GS approach is a lack of recognition of the political difficulties involved in adopting a Grand Strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessing the influence of obesity on longitudinal executive functioning performance in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,"Hilsendager, CA; Zhang, D; Mcrae, C; Aloia, M","Objective: To investigate longitudinal performance on an executive functioning task among individuals with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and the impact of obesity on performance.Methods: Participants completed the Trail Making Test Part B (TMT-B), which is an executive functioning task that measured cognitive flexibility, at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses were used to assess participants' initial performance on the task, as well the trajectories of growth on the task across time points. Additionally, body mass index (BMI) was included in the estimations of fixed and random effects as a predictor of performance.Results: There were no significant differences between obese and non-obese individuals on the cognitive flexibility task at baseline. However, obese and non-obese individuals differed significantly in their linear and quadratic rates of growth across time points.Conclusions: This study suggests that obese and non-obese individuals may differentially respond to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment (as related to cognitive flexibility). Future research should examine the impact of weight loss on the neuropsychological sequelae of obese individuals with OSAS. (C) 2015 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.

"Taxonomic variability of phytoplankton and relationship with production of CDOM in the polynya of the Amundsen Sea, Antarctica","Lee, YC; Park, MO; Jung, J; Yang, EJ; Lee, SH","To evaluate the relationship between the phytoplankton composition and the CDOM production in the Amundsen Sea, we examined the taxonomic variability of phytoplankton, nutrients and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) participating in two research cruises, ANA02C (February, 2012) and ANA04B (January, 2014). For both cruises, the peak concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) were measured in the Amundsen Sea Polynya (ASP) where the average Chl-a concentration was 2.31 mu g L-1 (+/- 1.01 mu g L-1) in February 2012 and 3.92 mu g L-1 (+/- 3.14 mu g L-1) in January 2014. The major phytoplankton groups were diatoms and prymnesiophytes, while the minor groups were cryptophytes, chlorophytes, dinophytes, chrysophytes and cyanophytes. The phytoplanlcton compositions in the sea ice zone (SIZ), the ASP and ice shelf (IS) was distinct. The predominance of Phaeocystis antarctica (P. antarctica) (70-90%) was observed at all stations, except in the SIZ in January 2014. While the CDOM concentrations (a(355)) ranged from 0.07 to 0.98 m(-1), the average values of a(355) of the euphotic layer in the ASP was 0.51 m(-1) (+/- 0.19 m(-1)), which was much higher than any other region of the Southern Ocean. CDOM showed strong correlation with Chl-a but no relationship with salinity, which implies that biological processes were the main source of CDOM. Among the major phytoplankton taxa, P. antarctica was confirmed as the most important contributor to the production of CDOM, according to the high correlation between marker pigment (hex-fuco) and CDOM. The unusually high CDOM in the ASP is expected to give as impact on the environment in various aspects. As a nature of CDOM, absorption of solar radiation at the surface can result in the increase of sea surface temperature (SSTs), which will accelerate the ice melting. Also the photo-oxidation of CDOM can serve as a feedback to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations after peak bloom in austral summer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Subjective and objective physical activity patterns after Roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery compared with non-operated obese and non-obese control women,"Wilms, B; Ernst, B; Thurnheer, M; Schultes, B","Introduction: Previous studies on physical activity after bariatric surgery provided inconsistent results. The aim of our study was to comprehensively assess physical activity by subjective (questionnaires) and objective (accelerometry) measures in women who had undergone Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery and to compare results with those of women displaying grade II or higher obesity and of non-obese control women.Methods: Our cross-sectional case-control study included 12 women in each group (RYGB, obese, non-obese). Wrist accelerometry was performed over 5 days. Two questionnaires were used to assess women's self-reported leisure-and work-time and sport-related physical activity.Results: Accelerometry indicated a lower physical activity in RYGB women than in non-obese women in particular during the weekend (p = 0.010), while there was no difference between RYGB and obese women (p = 0.57). Questionnaires revealed that RYGB women self-report a greater leisure-and work-time physical activity than obese women and also greater work-related physical activity than non-obese women (all p <= 0.032). In contrast, sport-related activities were reduced in RYGB as compared with non-obese women (p = 0.011), while there was no difference between RYGB and obese women (p = 0.51). Comparison of the obese and non-obese group revealed less leisure-time and sport-related activities in the obese women (both p <= 0.002).Discussion: Despite the preliminary character of our rather small study, data suggest a differential physical activity pattern in women who have previously undergone RYGB surgery that is characterized by rare sport activities, an increased subjective work-related physical activity and objectively reduced physical activity during the weekend as compared with non-obese control women.

Iodine environmental availability and human intake in oceanic islands: Azores as a case-study,"Linhares, DPS; Garcia, PV; Almada, A; Ferreira, T; Queiroz, G; Cruz, JV; Rodrigues, AD","Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of preventable mental impairment. Although several studies have established an association between ocean proximity and iodine environmental availability, recent studies revealed an inadequate iodine intake in the Azorean islands. In this study, we aim to understand the underlying causes of iodine environmental availability in oceanic islands and its association with iodine intake in schoolchildren, using the Azores as case-study.Iodine concentration in soil and grass pasture was measured by INAA and in drinking water by spectrophotometry. Urinary iodine concentration (UIC) in schoolchildren was assessed by ICP-MS in a randomized cross-sectional survey with 315 participants from S. Miguel (study group) and Sta. Maria islands (reference group). A validated diet questionnaire assessing sources of iodine was recorded.The iodine concentration in soils of the reference group was significantly higher than in the study group (58.1 ppm vs. 14.5 ppm, respectively; p = 0.001). The prevalence of schoolchildren with inadequate UIC was significantly higher in the study group than in the reference one (63.0% vs. 37.8%, respectively; p < 0.001). Chronic exposure to low iodine environmental availability was significantly associated with the exacerbation in iodine deficiency, with a risk 4.94 times higher in the study group.The differences observed in the studied islands are related with each island geomorphology (soil properties and orography) and climate, which can promote or inhibit iodine environmental availability, contributing distinctively to iodine bioavailability and human intake. These findings draw attention to an urgent need for a full investigation of Azores iodine status to apply evidence-based recommendations for iodine supplementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Biogas production from Macrocystis pyrifera biomass in seawater system,"Fan, XL; Guo, RB; Yuan, XZ; Qiu, YL; Yang, ZM; Wang, F; Sun, MT; Zhao, XX","Marine sediments from littoral and sublittoral location were evaluated as inocula for methane production from anaerobic fermentation of Macrocystis pyrifera in seawater system. Littoral sediment showed the higher methanogenetic activity from acetate and resulted in a higher biomethane yield of 217.1 +/- 2.4 mL/g-VS, which was comparable with that reported in freshwater system with desalted sea-weeds. With 0.8 mM sodium molybdate added, both the maximal methane yield and concentration increased while the lag-time was greatly shortened, suggesting that sulfate was one of the major inhibitors. Microbial community analysis revealed that degradation of M. pyrifera needed cooperation of very complex microbial populations. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens had an absolute dominance in distribution compared with the acetotrophic ones, indicating syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis might play important roles in the thalassic anaerobic fermentation system. These results clearly showed that biomethane production of raw seaweeds in seawater system was feasible. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Inscapes: A movie paradigm to improve compliance in functional magnetic resonance imaging,"Vanderwal, T; Kelly, C; Eilbott, J; Mayes, LC; Castellanos, FX","The examination of functional connectivity in fMRI data collected during task-free ""rest"" has provided a powerful tool for studying functional brain organization. Limitations of this approach include susceptibility to head motion artifacts and participant drowsiness or sleep. These issues are especially relevant when studying young children or clinical populations. Here we introduce a movie paradigm, Inscapes, that features abstract shapes without a narrative or scene-cuts. The movie was designed to provide enough stimulation to improve compliance related to motion and wakefulness while minimizing cognitive load during the collection of functional imaging data. We compare Inscapes to eyes-open rest and to age-appropriate movie clips in healthy adults (Ocean's Eleven, n = 22) and a pilot sample of typically developing children ages 3-7 (Fantasia, n = 13). Head motion was significantly lower during both movies relative to rest for both groups. In adults, movies decreased the number of participants who self-reported sleep. Intersubject correlations, used to quantify synchronized, task-evoked activity across movie and rest conditions in adults, involved less cortex during Inscapes than Ocean's Eleven. To evaluate the effect of movie-watching on intrinsic functional connectivity networks, we examined mean functional connectivity using both whole-brain functional parcellation and network-based approaches. Both inter-and intra-network metrics were more similar between Inscapes and Rest than between Ocean's Eleven and Rest, particularly in comparisons involving the default network. When comparing movies to Rest, the mean functional connectivity of somatomotor, visual and ventral attention networks differed significantly across various analyses. We conclude that low-demand movies like Inscapes may represent a useful intermediate condition between task-free rest and typical narrative movies while still improving participant compliance.

Integration of public health and primary care: A systematic review of the current literature in primary care physician mediated childhood obesity interventions,"Bhuyan, SS; Chandak, A; Smith, P; Carlton, EL; Duncan, K; Gentry, D","Introduction: Childhood obesity, with its growing prevalence, detrimental effects on population health and economic burden, is an important public health issue in the United States and worldwide. There is need for expansion of the role of primary care physicians in obesity interventions. The primary aim of this review is to explore primary care physician (PCP) mediated interventions targeting childhood obesity and assess the roles played by physicians in the interventions.Methods: A systematic review of the literature published between January 2007 and October 2014 was conducted using a combination of keywords like ""childhood obesity'', ""paediatric obesity'', ""childhood overweight'', ""paediatric overweight'', ""primary care physician'', ""primary care settings'', ""healthcare teams'', and ""community resources'' from MEDLINE and CINAHL during November 2014. Author name(s), publication year, sample size, patient's age, study and follow-up duration, intervention components, role of PCP, members of the healthcare team, and outcomes were extracted for this review.Results: Nine studies were included in the review. PCP-mediated interventions were composed of behavioural, education and technological interventions or a combination of these. Most interventions led to positive changes in Body Mass Index (BMI), healthier lifestyles and increased satisfaction among parents. PCPs participated in screening and diagnosing, making referrals for intervention, providing nutrition counselling, and promoting physical activity. PCPs, Dietitians and nurses were often part of the healthcare team.Conclusion: PCP-mediated interventions have the potential to effectively curb childhood obesity. However, there is a further need for training of PCPs, and explain new-types of interventions such as the use of technology. (C) 2015 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.

"Coastal ocean climatology of temperature and salinity off the Southern California Bight: Seasonal variability, climate index correlation, and linear trend","Kim, SY; Cornuelle, BD","A coastal ocean climatology of temperature and salinity in the Southern California Bight is estimated from conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) and bottle sample profiles collected by historical California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation (CalCOFI) cruises (1950-2009; quarterly after 1984) off southern California and quarterly/monthly nearshore CTD surveys (within 30 km from the coast except for the surfzone; 1999-2009) off San Diego and Los Angeles. As these fields are sampled regularly in space, but not in time, conventional Fourier analysis may not be possible. The time dependent temperature and salinity fields are modeled as linear combinations of an annual cycle and its five harmonics, as well as three standard climate indices (El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO)), the Scripps Pier temperature time series, and a mean and linear trend without time lags. Since several of the predictor indices are correlated, the indices are successively orthogonalized to eliminate ambiguity in the identification of the contributed variance of each component. Regression coefficients are displayed in both vertical transects and horizontal maps to evaluate (1) whether the temporal and spatial scales of the two data sets of nearshore and offshore observations are consistent and (2) how oceanic variability at a regional scale is related to variability in the nearshore waters. The data-derived climatology can be used to identify anomalous events and atypical behaviors in regional-scale oceanic variability and to provide background ocean estimates for mapping or modeling.

Integrating Human Factors & Ergonomics in large-scale engineering projects: Investigating a practical approach for ship design,"Mallam, SC; Lundh, M; MacKinnon, SN","The human element is a critical component of safe and efficient shipping operations but has struggled to gain comprehensive acceptance across the industry. This investigation explores a practical approach to introduce Human Factors and Ergonomics knowledge early in ship design by utilizing general arrangement drawings as a common platform for stakeholder input throughout ship development. An onboard data collection was completed using a cargo ship and its crew as a. case study. A comparative analysis between the ship's two-dimensional general arrangement drawings from which the structure was built, and the constructed onboard work environment was performed. Additionally, the engine crew was job-shadowed and interviewed to gain insight into their work demands and movement within the space. General arrangement drawings were found to be incomplete and when directly compared to a finalized product indicated inaccuracies in design and work environment characteristics, making comprehensive human element evaluations difficult. However, general arrangement drawings were found advantageous in mapping and visualizing logistical routing which can be evaluated early in ship development, positively contributing to crew operations once a ship is constructed. Solving the rudimentary design concerns engine crew struggle with earlier in ship design will provide a better foundation for increasingly detailed development.Relevance to industry: This research investigates a design approach which integrates Human Factors and Ergonomics knowledge in a pragmatic, resource-efficient manner which can positively impact onboard crew operations. An integrative design approach is necessary for widespread acceptance and adoption of human element considerations within naval architecture design and construction methodologies.

"Marine Governance in a European context: Regionalization, integration and cooperation for ecosystem-based management","Soma, K; van Tatenhove, J; van Leeuwen, J","New EU policy initiatives within the Maritime Strategy Framework Directive, the Integrated Maritime Policy, the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, the offshore Energy policy and the Blue Growth Strategy, are in different manners aiming at implementing Ecosystem Based Management (EBM). EBM focuses on regional areas, as opposed to traditional sectoral driven policy approaches, aiming for integrated planning and coherent management. Understanding how regionalization processes work to enhance legitimate and responsible governance leading to improved sustainability persists one of the main challenges to Marine Governance. Marine Governance involves processes of interaction between state actors, market parties, supranational organizations and civil society in a multi-level and multilayered institutional setting. We argue that processes of integration and cooperation are core drivers to regionalize previous European state based institutions. Accordingly, the main aim of this article is to provide a framework to unravel the challenges of integration and cooperation in Marine Governance. Particularly through processes of regionalization, i.e. when redefining territorial spaces and recomposing political spaces at the regional sea level, this framework is used to assess how integration and cooperation perform in EU marine governance. Specifically, four modes of regionalization in Marine Governance have been identified depending on the level of cooperation and integration, referred to as: territorial synchrony, territorial anarchy, sectoral anarchy and sectoral synchrony. While some developments towards more territorial synchrony for EU Marine Governance is observed, more cooperative and integrated efforts will be needed to eventually become successful in moving from sectoral anarchy to the desired territorial synergy expressed in EU marine regulation.

Food intake and serum persistent organic pollutants in the Greenlandic pregnant women: The ACCEPT sub-study,"Long, MH; Knudsen, AKS; Pedersen, HS; Bonefeld-Jorgensen, EC","The Greenlandic Inuit have high blood concentrations of environmental persistent organic pollutants (POPs). High POP concentrations have been associated with age, smoking and consumption of marine mammals. Studies have indicated that exposure to POPs during pregnancy may adversely affect fetal and child development.To assess geographical differences in diet, lifestyle and environmental contaminant exposure among pregnant women in Greenland, blood samples and questionnaire data were collected from 207 pregnant women in five Greenlandic regions (North, Disco Bay, West, South and East). Blood samples were analyzed for 11 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), 14 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 5 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 15 perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) and 63 metals.A trend of higher intake of marine mammals in the East and North regions was reflected by a higher n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratio. Participants in the East region tended also to have higher intake of terrestrial species. A significant higher seabird intake was seen for pregnant women in the West region. Significant regional differences were found for blood concentrations of PCBs, OCPs, PFASs and mercury, with higher levels in the North and East regions. PFASs were significantly associated with PCBs and OCPs inmost of the regions. In the North region, PFASs were associated with both selenium and mercury. No significant regional difference was observed for PBDEs.The regional differences of blood levels of POPs and mercury were related to differences in intake of the traditional food. Compared to earlier reports, decreased levels of legacy POPs, Hg and Pb and perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid were observed, but the levels of PFAS congeners perfluorohexane sulfonate and perfluorononanoic acid were sustained. The detection of POPs and heavy metals in maternal blood indicates fetal exposure to these compounds possibly influencing fetal development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) in breast milk in Shanghai, China: A temporal upward trend","Lu, DS; Lin, YJ; Feng, C; Wang, DL; She, JW; Shen, HT; Wang, GQ; Zhou, ZJ","Human milk samples were collected from 150 mothers in 2011 and 2012 in Shanghai, China and analyzed for 17 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDD/Fs) and 12 dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs). The up-bound Toxic Equivalent Quantity (TEQ) ranged from 0.27 to 16.8 pg TEQ/g lipid (mean 5.4 pg TEQ/g lipid) for Sigma PCDD/Fs and from 0.75 to 10.2 pg TEQ/g lipid (mean 2.9 pg TEQ/g lipid) for Sigma DL-PCBs. TEQs in our study were lower than those in most countries worldwide, and displayed a notable uptrend, in contrast with those in China's national survey in 2007. TEQs in mother milks from urban areas were higher than those from rural areas, and an orderly distribution was found in four geographical regions: Eastern China > Central China Southwestern China > Northwestern China. Levels of analytes in Shanghai native mothers' milk ranked the first among those from all provinces and cities investigated. Migrant mothers to Shanghai from other inland provinces could potentially represent the population for exposure and risk assessment in their birth and grown-up places. Both the distribution and the uptrend were associated with release of these pollutants due to rapid industrialization and urbanization in China. Fine correlations were observed between TEQs and age of mothers, and weak correlations between TEQs and consumption of meat & meat products. Participants, who preferred both fresh water and marine fish to freshwater fish only, were prone to be exposed to higher level of PCBs. The estimated daily intake (EDI) doses for breastfed neonates entirely exceeded the tolerable intake dose by WHO. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

On the reconstruction of palaeo-ice sheets: Recent advances and future challenges,"Stokes, CR; Tarasov, L; Blomdin, R; Cronin, TM; Fisher, TG; Gyllencreutz, R; Hattestrand, C; Heyman, J; Hindmarsh, RCA; Hughes, ALC; Jakobsson, M; Kirchner, N; Livingstone, SJ; Margold, M; Murton, JB; Riko, N; Peltier, WR; Peteet, DM; Piper, DJW; Preusser, F; Renssen, H; Roberts, DH; Roche, DM; Saint-Ange, F; Stroeven, AP; Teller, JT","Reconstructing the growth and decay of palaeo-ice sheets is critical to understanding mechanisms of global climate change and associated sea-level fluctuations in the past, present and future. The significance of palaeo-ice sheets is further underlined by the broad range of disciplines concerned with reconstructing their behaviour, many of which have undergone a rapid expansion since the 1980s. In particular, there has been a major increase in the size and qualitative diversity of empirical data used to reconstruct and date ice sheets, and major improvements in our ability to simulate their dynamics in numerical ice sheet models. These developments have made it increasingly necessary to forge interdisciplinary links between sub-disciplines and to link numerical modelling with observations and dating of proxy records. The aim of this paper is to evaluate recent developments in the methods used to reconstruct ice sheets and outline some key challenges that remain, with an emphasis on how future work might integrate terrestrial and marine evidence together with numerical modelling. Our focus is on pan-ice sheet reconstructions of the last deglaciation, but regional case studies are used to illustrate methodological achievements, challenges and opportunities. Whilst various disciplines have made important progress in our understanding of ice-sheet dynamics, it is clear that data-model integration remains under-used, and that uncertainties remain poorly quantified in both empirically-based and numerical ice-Sheet reconstructions. The representation of past climate will continue to be the largest source of uncertainty for numerical modelling. As such, palaeo-observations are critical to constrain and validate modelling. State-of-the-art numerical models will continue to improve both in model resolution and in the breadth of inclusion of relevant processes, thereby enabling more accurate and more direct comparison with the increasing range of palaeo-observations. Thus, the capability is developing to use all relevant palaeo-records to more strongly constrain deglacial (and to a lesser extent pre-LGM) ice sheet evolution. In working towards that goal, the accurate representation of uncertainties is required for both constraint data and model outputs. Close cooperation between modelling and data-gathering communities is essential to ensure this capability is realised and continues to progress. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessing determinants of maternal blood concentrations for persistent organic pollutants and metals in the eastern and western Canadian Arctic,"Curren, MS; Liang, CL; Davis, K; Kandola, K; Brewster, J; Potyrala, M; Chan, HM","Aboriginal peoples in the Canadian Arctic are exposed to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and metals mainly through their consumption of a traditional diet of wildlife items. Recent studies indicate that many human chemical levels have decreased in the north, likely due to a combination of reduced global chemical emissions, dietary shifts, and risk mitigation efforts by local health authorities. Body burdens for chemicals in mothers can be further offset by breast feeding, parity, and other maternal characteristics.We have assessed the impact of several dietary and maternal covariates following a decade of awareness of the contaminant issue in northern Canada, by performing multiple stepwise linear regression analyses from blood concentrations and demographic variables for 176 mothers recruited from Nunavut and the Northwest Territories during the period 2005-2007. A significant aboriginal group effect was observed for the modeled chemicals, except for lead and cadmium, after adjusting for covariates. Further, blood concentrations for POPs and metals were significantly associated with at least one covariate of older age, fewer months spent breastfeeding, more frequent eating of traditional foods, or smoking during pregnancy. Cadmium had the highest explained variance (72.5%) from just two significant covariates (current smoking status and parity).Although Inuit participants from the Northwest Territories consumed more traditional foods in general, Inuit participants from coastal communities in Nunavut continued to demonstrate higher adjusted blood concentrations for POPs and metals examined here. While this is due in part to a higher prevalence of marine mammals in the eastern Arctic diet, it is possible that other aboriginal group effects unrelated to diet may also contribute to elevated chemical body burdens in Canadian Arctic populations.

Influencing weight bias: The impact of biased questionnaire anchors on stereotype beliefs and judgments,"Carels, RA; Rossi, J; Taylor, M; Borushok, J; Kiefner-Burmeister, A; Cross, N; Hinman, N; Burmeister, JM","Objectives: In this investigation, biased questionnaire response anchors were designed to indirectly manipulate respondents' estimates of their peers' stereotypic beliefs or the estimates of scientific research findings about individuals with obesity. The current study tested the hypothesis that biased response anchors could influence personal beliefs about obesity.Methods: Two-hundred adults participated in the study. A simple manipulation of questionnaire items (i.e., asking respondents to estimate peers' beliefs or scientific research findings) using biased response scale anchors was designed to subtly relay information about certain personality traits of individuals with obesity.Results: The anchor manipulation significantly influenced participants' immediate and follow-up weight biased beliefs as well as participants' evaluation of an obese job applicant's potential for employment.Conclusion: Social judgments about obese individuals may be susceptible to subtle manipulation of response anchors and may be impacted by the source of comparison information (e.g., peers; scientific research).

An assessment of Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation during 1958-2007 in a suite of interannual CORE-II simulations,"Farneti, R; Downes, SM; Griffies, SM; Marsland, SJ; Behrens, E; Bentsen, M; Bi, DH; Biastoch, A; Boning, C; Bozec, A; Canuto, VM; Chassignet, E; Danabasoglu, G; Danilov, S; Diansky, N; Drange, H; Fogli, PG; Gusev, A; Hallberg, RW; Howard, A; Ilicak, M; Jung, T; Kelley, M; Large, WG; Leboissetier, A; Long, M; Lu, JH; Masina, S; Mishra, A; Navarra, A; Nurser, AJG; Patara, L; Samuels, BL; Sidorenko, D; Tsujino, H; Uotila, P; Wang, Q; Yeager, SG","In the framework of the second phase of the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments (CORE-II), we present an analysis of the representation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in a suite of seventeen global ocean-sea ice models. We focus on the mean, variability and trends of both the ACC and MOC over the 1958-2007 period, and discuss their relationship with the surface forcing. We aim to quantify the degree of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the models participating in CORE-II, and compare our results with available observations, previous fineresolution numerical studies and theoretical constraints. Most models show weak ACC transport sensitivity to changes in forcing during the past five decades, and they can be considered to be in an eddy saturated regime. Larger contrasts arise when considering MOC trends, with a majority of models exhibiting significant strengthening of the MOC during the late 20th and early 21st century. Only a few models show a relatively small sensitivity to forcing changes, responding with an intensified eddy-induced circulation that provides some degree of eddy compensation, while still showing considerable decadal trends. Both ACC and MOC interannual variabilities are largely controlled by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Based on these results, models are clustered into two groups. Models with constant or two-dimensional (horizontal) specification of the eddy-induced advection coefficient K show larger ocean interior decadal trends, larger ACC transport decadal trends and no eddy compensation in the MOC. Eddy-permitting models or models with a threedimensional time varying K show smaller changes in isopycnal slopes and associated ACC trends, and partial eddy compensation. As previously argued, a constant in time or space lc is responsible for a poor representation of mesoscale eddy effects and cannot properly simulate the sensitivity of the ACC and MOC to changing surface forcing. Evidence is given for a larger sensitivity of the MOC as compared to the ACC transport, even when approaching eddy saturation. Future process studies designed for disentangling the role of momentum and buoyancy forcing in driving the ACC and MOC are proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Human recreational exposure to antibiotic resistant bacteria in coastal bathing waters,"Leonard, AFC; Zhang, LH; Balfour, A; Garside, R; Gaze, WH","Infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) are associated with poor health outcomes and are recognised globally as a serious health problem. Much research has been conducted on the transmission of ARB to humans. Yet the role the natural environment plays in the spread of ARB and antibiotic resistance genes is not well understood. Antibiotic resistant bacteria have been detected in natural aquatic environments, and ingestion of seawater during water sports is one route by which many people could be directly exposed. The aim was to estimate the prevalence of resistance to one clinically important class of antibiotics (thirdgeneration cephalosporins (3GC5)) amongst Escherichia coil in coastal surface waters in England and Wales. Prevalence data was used to quantify ingestion of 3GC-resistant E. coil (3GCREC) by people participating in water sports in designated coastal bathing waters. A further aim was to use this value to derive a populationlevel estimate of exposure to these bacteria during recreational use of coastal waters in 2012.The prevalence of 3GC-resistance amongst E. coil isolated from coastal surface waters was estimated using culture-based methods. This was combined with the density of E. coli reported in designated coastal bathing waters along with estimations of the volumes of water ingested during various water sports reported in the literature to calculate the mean number of 3GCREC ingested during different water sports.0.12% of E. coli isolated from surface waters were resistant to 3GCs. This value was used to estimate that in England and Wales over 6.3 million water sport sessions occurred in 2012 that resulted in the ingestion of at least one 3GCREC.Despite the low prevalence of resistance to 3GC5 amongst E. coil in surface waters, there is an identifiable human exposure risk for water users, which varies with the type of water sport undertaken. The relative importance of this exposure is likely to be greater in areas where a large proportion of the population enjoys water sports. Millions of water sport sessions occurred in 2012 that were likely to have resulted in people ingesting E. coli resistant to a single class of antibiotics (3GC5). However, this is expected to be a significant underestimate of recreational exposure to all ARE in seawater.This is the first study to use volumes of water ingested during different water sports to estimate human exposure to ARB. Further work needs to be done to elucidate the health implications and clinical relevance of exposure to ARE in both marine and fresh waters in order to fully understand the risk to public health.

Using expert informed GIS to locate important marine social-ecological hotspots,"Mahboubi, P; Parkes, M; Stephen, C; Chan, HM","The marine environment provides significant benefits to many local communities. Pressure to develop coastal waterways worldwide creates an urgent need for tools to locate marine spaces that have important social or ecological values, and to quantify their relative importance. The primary objective of this study was to develop, apply and critically assess a tool to identify important social-ecological hotspots in the marine environment. The study was conducted in a typical coastal community in northern British Columbia, Canada. This expert-informed GIS, or xGIS, tool used a survey instrument to draw on the knowledge of local experts from a range of backgrounds with respect to a series of 12 social-ecological value attributes, such as biodiversity, cultural and economic values. We identified approximately 1500 polygons on marine maps and assigned relative values to them using a token distribution exercise. A series of spatial statistical analyses were performed to locate and quantify the relative social-ecological importance of marine spaces and the results were ultimately summarized in a single hotspot map of the entire study area. This study demonstrates the utility of xGIS as a useful tool for stakeholders and environmental managers engaged in the planning and management of marine resources at the local and regional levels.

Misperception of weight status and associated factors among undergraduate students,"Mogre, V; Aleyira, S; Nyaba, R","Problem: We compared participants' self-perception of their weight with the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition for BMI categories among undergraduate university students undertaking health related academic programmes in Ghana. Also, we investigated factors associated to the underestimation of weight status in this sample.Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample of 368 undergraduate students. Anthropometric measurements of weight and height were measured with appropriate tools and computed into Body Mass Index (BMI) categorised based on WHO classifications. Waist and hip circumferences were also measured appropriately. Participants' self-perception of weight status was assessed by the question: How do you perceive your weight? (a) Underweight, (b) normal weight, (c) overweight, and (d) obese. The BMI-measured weight status was compared to the self-perceived weight status by cross-tabulation, Kappa statistics of agreement and chi(2) for trend analysis. Factors associated with misperception of weight status was measured using univariate and multivariable analysis.Results: Thirteen percent (n = 48) of the participants were overweight/obesity (BMI) and 31.5% had central obesity. Overall, 20.6% of the participants misperceived their weight status in which 78.9% of them underestimated it. Among overweight/obese participants, 41.7% self-perceived themselves accurately. Whereas 10.6% of normal weight participants underestimated their weight status, over half (58.3%) of overweight/obese participants did so. Factors that were associated with underestimation of weight status were having overweight/obesity (BMI) and central obesity.Conclusion: Underestimation of weight status was frequent. Health professionals and related government agencies should develop intervention programmes to empower young people to have accurate weight status perception.

A modified diagnostic social-ecological system framework for lobster fisheries: Case implementation and sustainability assessment in Southern California,"Partelow, S; Boda, C","Fisheries exemplify the immense complexity of interactions in social-ecological systems (SESs). This complexity has created management challenges and raises concerns for the sustainability of our marine natural resource systems. This article contributes to SES fisheries research and management in two ways: first, it enhances our understanding of lobster fisheries as complex social-ecological systems, focusing on the Southern California Spiny Lobster Fishery (SCSLF) as a case study. Secondly, it demonstrates a methodological approach for assessing component interactions in SESs that can be used to assess the sustainability of management approaches. The first contribution involves the systematic review of the literature on lobster fisheries management and their SES characteristics. The review results are then used to modify and extensively define the diagnostic SES framework for specific use in lobster fisheries. For the second contribution, we demonstrate how to operationalize the modified framework for the diagnosis of a real-life case, using the SCSLF as an example. This involves framing the SCSLF classificatory diagnosis for analysis of the stakeholder-comprised management group of the SCSLF as a social-ecological action situation. This analysis is aided by the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, a SES-imbedded tool used in our case to assess sustainability in resource management systems through critical analysis of stakeholder and resource system interactions. More generally, we find that research in lobster fisheries could benefit from broadening its scope of analysis, as overly narrow research foci have worked to limit the production of more holistic SES knowledge. Our exemplary analysis of the LAC's management of the SCSLF shows that the SES contains multiple components which have been associated with sustainable outcomes elsewhere; however, the fishery still faces many obstacles, including how to adapt to future challenges. Our results contribute to developing a holistic methodological approach for operationalizing SES framework research into practical fisheries management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Storm surge risk perception and resilience: A pilot study in the German North Sea coast,"Gonzalez-Riancho, P; Gerkensmeier, B; Ratter, IMW; Gonzalez, M; Medina, R","Resilience is defined as the capacity of a community to organise itself before, during and after a dangerous/hazardous event in order to minimise the impacts. A conceptual framework is proposed to assess the resilience of a community by understanding and integrating the institutional, legal and social capacities to cope and recover from a natural hazardous event in order to minimize the impacts in the short-term and to adapt to the risk in the long-term. A survey-based method and a specific resilience questionnaire is proposed to explore the perception of stakeholders regarding the risk and emergency management processes as well as psychological and social factors conditioning individual and community preparedness. The method is applied in a pilot area (the Dithmarschen district in the German North Sea Coast) for its validation before applying it to the entire Wadden Sea region, the pilot results being presented in this work. Although some questions may need some type of adaptation to fit adequately to other study sites, the conceptual and methodological framework could be applied worldwide. The study area and its population are characterized by their continuous interaction with the ocean, with the continuous transformation and reclamation of land for agricultural and other purposes, the constant reshaping of the coastline and frequent coastal inundation by storm surge flooding. The assessment allows identifying the main characteristics of the study area in terms of stakeholders' risk perception, intention to prepare, individual and societal behavioural patterns, as well as their opinion regarding authorities' decision-making on emergency and risk management. It also addresses potential improvement in emergency and risk management in terms of multi-sector partnerships and additional adaptation measures for the area. The deficiencies and incoherencies between society's and administration's answers detected in the analysis point towards the challenges to deal with, in order to foster an adequate community preparedness and adaptation to storm surge risk. Some of the results that the proposed method permitted to obtain in the study area show (i) the need for abetter information strategy to enhance society's awareness and preparedness; (ii) the respondents' current proactive behaviour and preference on participatory risk management options, despite fully participatory schemes are not yet set by the authorities; (iii) the need for awareness campaigns regarding the relevance and benefits of the integrated approach in potential partnerships, and (iv) the need for tailored and site-specific adaptation instruments and measures due to the current society's disagreement with some of the options currently provided. The results are useful to improve risk reduction initiatives by means of including society's opinions from the beginning of the management process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"The role of diversification in dynamic small-scale fisheries: Lessons from Baja California Sur, Mexico","Finkbeiner, EM","Globally, small-scale fisheries are critical for livelihoods and food security yet face increasing uncertainty and variability from processes such as overfishing, globalization, and climate change. Enhancing the number of options for human response through increased access to marine resources, diverse livelihood approaches, and generalist fishing strategies may attenuate the negative effects of change and disturbance. My research explores the relative importance of diversification strategies for achieving resilient small-scale fishing communities and cooperatives of Baja California Sur, Mexico. Specifically, interview data and long-term catch and economic data were used to develop an economic metric of resilience, in addition to income diversification indices, for fishing cooperatives. Fishing cooperative characteristics and environmental conditions were then evaluated as possible predictors of cooperatives' relative ability to diversify. I found that while diversification was important for risk mitigation and stabilizing income, the ability of cooperatives to specialize during favorable conditions may be important for poverty reduction and wealth accumulation. Thus, the flexibility to move across fishing strategies given changing environmental conditions is important for the adaptive capacity of small-scale fishing cooperatives. My findings will contribute to a better understanding of the institutional arrangements that promote a resilient small-scale fishery, and therefore, will be invaluable for practitioners of small-scale fisheries.

"Impact of combat events on first responders: Experiences of the armed conflict in Uruzgan, Afghanistan","Hoencamp, R; Idenburg, FJ; Vermetten, E; Tan, E; Plat, MC; Hoencamp, E; Leenen, LPH; Hamming, JF","Introduction: Care for battle casualties demands special skills from medics, nurses, and tactical commanders. To date, no inventory has been performed evaluating the first responders (medics, nurses and tactical commanders) around battle casualties.Method: This observational cohort study was conducted amongst the first responders (n = 195) who were deployed to Southern Afghanistan (2009-2010) in three Marine companies. The survey focused on four main topics: (1) participants general background, (2) exposure to combat (casualty) situations, (3) self-perceived quality of care (1 [low]-10 [high]) in the pre-hospital phase, and (4) the effects of combat stressors on professional skills and social environment using the Post Deployment Reintegration Scale (PDRS) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R).Results: 71% of the eligible Dutch tactical commanders, medics, and nurses participated in this survey. Most (14/16) medics and nurses scored their pre-deployment training as sufficient The overall self-perceived quality of care score was above average (7.8). Most (80%) of the participants were exposed to battle casualties. There were no significant differences regarding rank, gender, age and military task using the impact of event scale and PDRS, except for a worse score on the work negative, family positive and personal positive subscales (p < 0.05) in the PDRS for the first responders in comparison to the armed forces norm score.Conclusion: The quality of care in the pre-hospital phase was considered adequate, symptoms of post-traumatic stress in this group was low. Active involvement of co-combatants and the social support network are essential in adaption after exposure to combat events.

Impacts and Recovery from Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi on the Great Barrier Reef,"Beeden, R; Maynard, J; Puotinen, M; Marshall, P; Dryden, J; Goldberg, J; Williams, G","Full recovery of coral reefs from tropical cyclone (TC) damage can take decades, making cyclones a major driver of habitat condition where they occur regularly. Since 1985, 44 TCs generated gale force winds (>= 17 metres/second) within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Of the hurricane strength TCs (>= H1-Saffir Simpson scale; >= category 3 Australian scale), TC Yasi (February, 2011) was the largest. In the weeks after TC Yasi crossed the GBRMP, participating researchers, managers and rangers assessed the extent and severity of reef damage via 841 Reef Health and Impact Surveys at 70 reefs. Records were scaled into five damage levels representing increasingly widespread colony-level damage (1, 2, 3) and reef structural damage (4, 5). Average damage severity was significantly affected by direction (north vs south of the cyclone track), reef shelf position (mid-shelf vs outershelf) and habitat type. More outer-shelf reefs suffered structural damage than mid-shelf reefs within 150 km of the track. Structural damage spanned a greater latitudinal range for mid-shelf reefs than outer-shelf reefs (400 vs 300 km). Structural damage was patchily distributed at all distances, but more so as distance from the track increased. Damage extended much further from the track than during other recent intense cyclones that had smaller circulation sizes. Just over 15% (3,834 km(2)) of the total reef area of the GBRMP is estimated to have sustained some level of coral damage, with >= 4% (949 km(2)) sustaining a degree of structural damage.

Spectroscopic analyses of chemical adaptation processes within microalgal biomass in response to changing environments,"Vogt, F; White, L","Via photosynthesis, marine phytoplankton transforms large quantities of inorganic compounds into biomass. This has considerable environmental impacts as microalgae contribute for instance to counter-balancing anthropogenic releases of the greenhouse gas CO2. On the other hand, high concentrations of nitrogen compounds in an ecosystem can lead to harmful algae blooms. In previous investigations it was found that the chemical composition of microalgal biomass is strongly dependent on the nutrient availability. Therefore, it is expected that algae's sequestration capabilities and productivity are also determined by the cells' chemical environments. For investigating this hypothesis, novel analytical methodologies are required which are capable of monitoring live cells exposed to chemically shifting environments followed by chemometric modeling of their chemical adaptation dynamics.FTIR-ATR experiments have been developed for acquiring spectroscopic time series of live Dunaliella parva cultures adapting to different nutrient situations. Comparing experimental data from acclimated cultures to those exposed to a chemically shifted nutrient situation reveals insights in which analyte groups participate in modifications of microalgal biomass and on what time scales. For a chemometric description of these processes, a data model has been deduced which explains the chemical adaptation dynamics explicitly rather than empirically. First results show that this approach is feasible and derives information about the chemical biomass adaptations. Future investigations will utilize these instrumental and chemometric methodologies for quantitative investigations of the relation between chemical environments and microalgal sequestration capabilities.

Can Facebook be used to increase scientific literacy? A case study of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute Facebook page and ocean literacy,"Fauville, G; Dupont, S; von Thun, S; Lundin, J","The Internet provides a unique opportunity for scientists to be in direct contact with the public in order to promote citizens' scientific literacy. Recently, Internet users have started to spend most of their online time on social networking sites (SNS). Knowledge of how these SNSs work as an arena for interaction, as well as for the development of scientific literacy, is important to guide scientists' activities online, and to be able to understand how people develop knowledge of science. This was evaluated by scrutinizing the Facebook page of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and the consequences for users' ocean literacy. We investigated which practices could increase the number of users reached by a Facebook story. We also found that Facebook pages do not offer the appropriate social context to foster participation since it has only a few of the features of an arena where such practices could develop.

Overcoming barriers to knowledge exchange for adaptive resource management; the perspectives of Australian marine scientists,"Cvitanovic, C; Hobday, AJ; Kerkhoff, L; Marshall, NA","The sustainable science-based management of natural resources requires knowledge exchange between scientists and environmental decision-makers; however, evidence suggests that information flow is inhibited by a range of barriers. To date, our understanding of the range and importance of factors limiting knowledge exchange between scientists and decision-makers is based primarily on the perceptions of decision-makers, while the perceptions of scientists have been largely overlooked. This study addresses this knowledge gap by quantitatively assessing the perceptions of scientists, represented by a sample of 78 Australian marine scientists, regarding (i) the role and importance of engaging with environmental decision-makers on a personal level, (ii) the role and importance of engaging with environmental decision-makers at the institutional level, (iii) current barriers to engaging with environmental decision-makers and (iv) options for overcoming barriers to engaging with environmental decision-makers. Survey results suggest that Australian marine scientists feel that they have an obligation to engage decision-makers in their science, and that engaging with and communicating to environmental decision-makers is important on a personal level. This study also identifies a range of barriers that impede engagement activities, including inadequate measures of science impact that do not account for engagement activities, a lack of organisational support for engagement activities, insufficient time to conduct engagement activities in addition to other responsibilities and a lack of funding to support engagement activities. To overcome these barriers, participants identified the need for institutional innovation by research institutions, research funders and decision-making agencies alike to promote a culture whereby knowledge exchange activities are legitimised as core business for research scientists, and recognised and rewarded appropriately. Although difficulties exist in implementing such institutional innovations, doing so will improve, two-way knowledge exchange among scientists and decision-makers and improve the likely success of environmental management.

Denitrification and flushing of the Santa Barbara Basin bottom waters,"Goericke, R; Bograd, SJ; Grundle, DS","The sediments of the Santa Barbara Basin (SBB) are an important paleoecological resource since their structure reflects the oxygenation of the bottom waters and the quality and quantity of the particulate matter which is sequestered to the bottom of the basin. These properties are controlled by regional atmospheric and oceanic climate. The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program has been monitoring the bottom waters of the SBB on a regular basis since 1986. Over the last decade, properties of SBB bottom waters have undergone dramatic changes: low concentrations of nitrate were observed more frequently and concentrations of nitrite, at times, reached values of 7 mu M, in contrast to maximum concentrations of 0.2 mu M observed during the earlier time period. Here we study the links between regional climate and conditions at the bottom of the SBB by relating recent changes in bottom water chemistry to local and regional forcing of the basin. Varying rates of primary production of the overlying water or rates of export production were not significantly related to the observed biogeochemical changes in the basin. Rather, the frequency or rate of flushing, as inferred from phosphate concentration changes at the bottom of the basin, and decreasing concentrations of oxygen in the waters outside the basins could be related to the observed changes. The episodic more than 10-fold increases of nitrite in the bottom waters likely represent a tipping point in the biogeochemical system driven by decreasing concentrations of oxygen in the bottom waters.

The KwaZulu-Natal Boat Launch Site Monitoring System: A novel approach for improved management of small vessels in the coastal zone,"Mann, BQ; Maggs, JQ; Khumalo, MC; Khumalo, D; Parak, O; Wood, J; Bachoo, S","The KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province of South Africa has a large recreational and commercial boating industry, which includes line-fishing, scuba diving and other activities. Most of the vessels used are relatively small (less than 10 m long) and are capable of being launched from a beach directly through the surf. Beach launching in KZN is restricted to officially registered beach launch sites. The provincial government is responsible for the management of these sites, which is currently governed by national legislation controlling beach driving. Stakeholders in these launch sites include various government and non-government institutions as well as the launch site licence holders, the launch site operators and the boat users themselves. Collaboration between the stakeholders in KZN has resulted in the development of a Boat launch Site Monitoring System (BLSMS) which includes maintenance of a daily launch register at all registered launch sites. All records from the launch registers are captured onto the BLSMS database providing comprehensive resource-use statistics. This is the first attempt at a province-wide monitoring initiative for boat launch sites in South Africa. The system also provides the only estimate of total fishing effort by marine recreational boat-based anglers. It is an example of unique, mutually beneficial cooperation between different stakeholders towards the common goal of improved management of small craft launch sites in KZN and the resources accessed offshore. Some of the highlights and challenges of this innovative monitoring programme for the period 2005-2012 are presented and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Co-governance of Small-Scale Shellfisheries in Latin America: Institutional Adaptability to External Drivers of Change,"Castrejon, M; Defeo, O","The resilience of small-scale shellfisheries in Latin America is increasingly threatened by climatic and human drivers acting simultaneously at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Co-governance is emerging as a potential solution to enhance the capability of governing systems to respond to the social-ecological impacts of external drivers of change. Although there is an increasing understanding of the factors that determine the success and failures of diverse co-governance arrangements in Latin America, there is still a poor understanding about how this mode of governance responds to different crises, and how these responses are shaped by past experiences and by the features of the governing system and the system-to-be-governed. In this chapter, we evaluate how institutions learn, self-organize and respond to diverse climatic and human drivers in seven co-governance arrangements, and identify the factors that enable or inhibit building institutional adaptability. Our analysis shows that the combined impact of different drivers produced social-ecological impacts on local fishing communities' wellbeing. In this context, institutions and actors displayed coping and adaptive responses to prevent or mitigate the damage on fishery resources and fishers' livelihoods. These varied according to the magnitude, extent, periodicity and intensity of press and pulse perturbations, and were shaped by past crises, social-ecological memory and the particular social features of fishing communities in which institutions are embedded. In most cases, after severe crises, small-scale fishers took collaborative actions for re-organizing their cooperatives and their harvesting and trading strategies in order to prevent future crises and enter into more sustainable pathways. In conclusion, the same factors that promote (or preclude) high governability are also those that enable (or inhibit) building institutional adaptability and resilience.",2015,,INTERACTIVE GOVERNANCE FOR SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES: GLOBAL REFLECTIONS,13,,605-625,WOS:000384051700039,10.1007/978-3-319-17034-3_3110.1007/978-3-319-17034-3,,#20230,Castrejon 2015,,
Fishing for recognition: Understanding the use of NGO guidelines in fishery improvement projects,"Deighan, LK; Jenkins, LD","This study examines the use of non-governmental organization (NGO) guidelines in a fishery improvement project (FIP) in the Gulf of Mexico reef fish fishery. FIPs recently emerged as a way to assist fisheries in reaching environmental sustainability. The Conservation Alliance for Seafood Solutions, a group of NGOs dedicated to seafood sustainability, created a set of guidelines for FIPs. These guidelines outline the process necessary for FIPs to receive market recognition as moving towards sustainability. Interviews with stakeholders and PIP documents were analyzed to understand how these guidelines are utilized in practice and how this helps fisheries progress toward sustainability. The guidelines focus on sustainability as defined by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification standard, though certification is not required. Though informants were interested in market benefits, none currently desired MSC certification. Informants were partially motivated by the potential to increase their power in the fishery management process. These motivations, in combination with a clear process to identify, address, and monitor improvement needs, aid progress toward sustainability. In addition, insufficient stakeholder identification and interaction has failed to ease tension among FIP stakeholders with a history of conflict over the fishery's management. However, this does not seem to hinder progress. Lastly, though many FIPs are led by NGOs, NGO participation is not required by the guidelines. Key informants identified NGO participation as helpful for providing knowledge, connecting them to other organizations, monitoring progress, and adding legitimacy to their work. Based on these results, recommendations for improvement and future research needs are identified. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessing Governability of Small-Scale Fisheries in Taklong Island National Marine Reserve in the Philippines,"Ferrer, AJG","This chapter identifies and describes the challenges in small-scale fisheries governance in the context of Taklong Island National Marine Reserve in Guimaras Province, Philippines. Results show that diversity (diverse species of flora and fauna; many fishers highly dependent on the fishery resources and other users), complexity (relationship between key fishery habitats and fish catch; low cooperation and compliance to laws and regulations and conflicts within and among stakeholder groups), dynamism (decline in the quality of the resources overtime; low mobility), and scale (relatively small-sized marine reserve with stakeholders from local to national levels) characterize the natural and social systems in the marine reserve, which lend themselves to low governability. The hierarchical governing mode with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources heading the interim Management Board has not been responsive to governance challenges posed by small-scale fisheries in the reserve. The lack of representativeness and inadequate exchange of information have led to poor quality interaction between the systems. Barriers have been created since ""step zero"" contributing to low governability. The case illustrates that a ""non-functional marine reserve"" is detrimental to the sustainability of coastal resources and wellbeing of the people.",2015,,INTERACTIVE GOVERNANCE FOR SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES: GLOBAL REFLECTIONS,13,,379-395,WOS:000384051700026,10.1007/978-3-319-17034-3_2010.1007/978-3-319-17034-3,,#20232,Ferrer 2015,,
Cooperative Sliding Mode Control Applied To A Fleet Of DP Vessels,"Ianagui, ASS; Tannuri, EA","This work presents an application of a Distributed Cooperative Control scheme for DP (Dynamic Positioning) marine vessels using Sliding Mode Control (SMC). The group task is to keep formation relative position within a tight tolerance. Global positioning is performed by means of a leader vessel that can be either real or virtual. Communication between ships is limited in order to keep a low data flow. The technique is applied to a group of 3-degree-of-freedom ships controlled by standard DP PID algorithms, subjected to winds, currents and waves forces. Results are then evaluated by simulation of a leader vessel and three other vessels performing relative positioning tasks, with and without the operation of the cooperation algorithm.

The trade in sharks and their products in the United Arab Emirates,"Jabado, RW; Al Ghais, SM; Hamza, W; Henderson, AC; Spaet, JLY; Shivji, MS; Hanner, RH","The rapid growth in the demand for shark products, particularly fins, has led to the worldwide overexploitation of many elasmobranch species. Although there are growing concerns about this largely unregulated and unmonitored trade, little information still exists about its dynamics, the species involved and the impact of this pressure on stocks in various regions. Our study provides the first attempt at characterizing the trade in shark products from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the fourth largest exporter in the world of raw dried shark fins to Hong Kong. A review of trade records and informal interviews with local traders confirmed that the UAE is being used as hub in the broader North Indian Ocean region for the trade in shark products with the Emirati fishery minimally contributing to this trade. Results based on morphological identification of sharks (n = 12,069) and DNA barcoding of tissue samples (n = 655) indicated that the trade was made up of at least 37 species. The most abundant families represented at the Dubai study site were the Sphyrnidae (9.3%), Lamnidae (9%) and Alopiidae (5.9%). While information was mostly limited to shark products originating from the UAE and Oman, results indicated that 45.3% of species traded were considered to be at high risk of global extinction based on the IUCN Red List Global Assessments. Since many of the species found during this survey are likely part of stocks shared with other countries, regional cooperation and management will be crucial to ensure their long term survival.

Single range observability for cooperative underactuated underwater vehicles,"Parlangeli, G; Indiveri, G","The paper addresses the single range observability analysis of a kinematics model of cooperating underactuated underwater vehicles. Teams of underwater vehicles that communicate with each other may be able to access and exchange their relative distances through, by example, acoustic signal time-of-flight measurements. Such relative distance measurements together with vehicle's attitude and velocity information may be used onboard to implement a navigation filter to estimate the vehicle's relative positions and orientations. A pre-requisite for successfully designing such navigation filters is to assess the systems observability properties. Contrary to the majority of existing studies on single range observability, the paper considers a more realistic underactuated kinematics model for slender body autonomous underwater vehicles rather than a simple point mass model. The paper extends previous results building on an augmented state technique allowing to reformulate the nonlinear observability problem in terms of a linear time varying one. As a result, all possible (globally) unobservable motions are characterized in terms of the systems' initial conditions and velocity commands within the class of interest. The fundamental results reported are also illustrated by numerical simulations providing evidence of different motions generating the same output, namely lacking observability.

Governance fit for climate change in a Caribbean coastal-marine context,"Pittman, J; Armitage, D; Alexander, S; Campbell, D; Alleyne, M","Coastal-marine systems in small island developing states of the Caribbean are highly vulnerable to both current and future climate change. Societies navigate these changes in part through processes of governance and the institutions through which governance takes place. The concept of institutional adaptive capacity is used to explore how governance processes and institutional arrangements can be adapted to match the scale and extent of climate change in a case study of the Soufriere Marine Management Area, St. Lucia. Institutional adaptive capacity is analyzed based on the following factors: institutional variety, analytical deliberation and nesting and networks. The analysis is based on 36 semi-structured interviews conducted with key informants from NGOs, cooperatives, management authorities and government agencies. The findings suggest that governance to address climate change in the case study is contingent upon developing holistic, integrated management systems, improving flexibility in existing collaborative decision making processes, augmenting the capacity of local management authorities with support from higher-level government, exploring opportunities for private-social partnerships, and developing adequate social-environmental monitoring programs. These findings have potential implications and lessons for similar settings throughout the Caribbean. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Marine wildlife entanglement: Assessing knowledge, attitudes, and relevant behaviour in the Australian community","Pearson, E; Mellish, S; Sanders, B; Litchfield, C","Marine debris remains a global challenge, with significant impacts on wildlife.

The changing role of NGOs in Mexican small-scale fisheries: From environmental conservation to multi-scale governance,"Espinosa-Romero, MJ; Rodriguez, LF; Weaver, AH; Villanueva-Aznar, C; Torre, J","Multi-scale governance has been widely recommended for effective marine resource management. This approach suggests collective decision-making, the devolution of some rights and responsibilities to various entities, co-production of knowledge, coupling governance and ecological scales, among other elements. Here, the elements of multi-scale governance of Mexican small-scale fisheries (SSF) and the contribution of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to this approach are described. Three management processes were selected for the analysis: (1) the development of the Fisheries Management Plan (FMP) for the swimming crab fishery; (2) the establishment of fishing refugia in the Punta San Cosme to Punta Coyote Corridor; and (3) the implementation of catch shares in the Gulf corvina fishery, The results suggest that NGOs are contributing to most of the key attributes for multi-scale fisheries governance. Given the NGOs' agenda shift in the Gulf of California region, from advocacy for environmental conservation to participation in sustainable management, there has been a wider promotion and acceptance of NGOs within governance related processes in fisheries management. In order to clarify alignments with other stakeholder agendas, as well as to continue building trust, NGOs need to make their governance agenda explicit. This work provides insights on how NGOs can contribute to multi-scale governance and a framework for the evaluation of management processes and the contribution of different stakeholders to multi-scale governance, which can be applied to any management process.

Gender variations in waist circumference levels between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australian populations: A systematic review,"Adegbija, OO; Wang, ZQ","Objectives: To compare gender-specific waist circumference (WC) levels of Aboriginal Australians with non-Aboriginal Australians.Methods: A systematic search on Medline, PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases was conducted to identify papers that reported gender-specific waist circumference (WC) estimates of participants from the age of 15 years and above among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. Means and their 95% confidence intervals of gender differences in WC, height and weight were recorded or calculated where they were not provided. Gender-specific WC, height and weight mean estimates were pooled and the I-2 statistic was used to test heterogeneity among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians.Results: Of 17 selected cross-sectional studies, 9 focused on Aboriginal and 8 on non-Aboriginal Australians. Seven studies reported significantly higher WC estimates among indigenous females than males. On the other hand, non-indigenous males had significantly higher WC levels than females. Males had greater height and weight estimates than females in both groups.Conclusion: Although indigenous women were shorter and had lower weight estimates, they had greater WC levels than indigenous men. This is the first systematic review to assess the gender-specific differences between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. The findings of this review warrant more efforts to understand and reduce the high prevalence of central obesity and related chronic diseases among Aboriginal women.

Fluvial response to sudden input of pyroclastic sediments during the 2008-2009 eruption of the Chaiten Volcano (Chile): The role of logjams,"Umazano, AM; Melchor, RN; Bedatou, E; Bellosi, ES; Krause, JM","The rhyolitic Plinian eruption of the Chilean Chaiten Volcano, initiated on May 2, 2008, suddenly introduced abundant pyroclastic sediments in the Blanco River catchment area, which experienced important modifications. Before May 2, the river was characterised by gravelly and moderate to low-sinuosity channels crossing a vegetated and locally urbanised (Chaiten City) floodplain. This river, limited by steep and densely forested highlands, was connected with the Pacific Ocean via a tidally-influenced delta plain. After heavy rains in May 11-20, the river discharge increased and triggered several responses including logjam formation and breakage, crevassing, avulsion (and channel abandonment), changes in the pattern and dimensions of channels, and construction of a new delta plain area. In this context, the goals of this contribution were: i) to document the sedimentological processes within a detailed geomorphic framework and ii) to understand the influence of logjams on fluvial dynamics. Upstream of the logjam zone, the deposits are mostly composed of ash and lapilli with abundant palaeovolcanic (epiclastic) sediments, which were produced by dilute currents and debris flows. Downstream of the logjam zone, deposits are composed by ash and lapilli, both pumice-rich and lacking important participation of older (epiclastic) sediments. The abandoned and filled palaeochannel, and the proximal part of crevasse splays experienced transient dilute flows with variable sediment concentration and, subordinately, hyperconcentrated flows. The distal sectors of crevasse splays mostly record settling from suspension. At the delta plain, tephra transported by the Blanco River was mixed with older sediments by tide and wave action (dilute flows). We conclude that immediately after eruption, both geomorphic and sedimentary processes of the river were mainly controlled by a combination of high availability of incoherent pyroclastic sediments on steep slopes, abundant rains, large logs that jammed the river and huge areas of devastated forest. Logjams played an important role in the river response to the volcanic eruption; they were responsible of the marked compositional change recorded upstream and downstream of the logjam zone and its breakage resulted in downstream flooding and avulsion. The likelihood of formation of logjams in rivers draining forested volcanic areas should be considered in the evaluation of volcanic hazards related to Plinian eruptions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Combining language and space: Sentence bisection in unilateral spatial neglect,"Veronelli, L; Guasti, MT; Arduino, LS; Vallar, G","In line bisection right-brain-damaged patients with left spatial neglect show a rightward deviation, with respect to the line's physical center. In word bisection ortho-phonological features of the stimulus' final (right-sided) part modulate performance of both patients and healthy participants (Veronelli, Vallar, Marinelli, Primativo, & Arduino, 2014). We investigated the role of linguistic factors in sentence bisection, in patients with and without neglect, and control participants. The effects of information in the right-sided part of the sentence (Experiment #1), and of lexical and syntactic violations (Experiment #2) were assessed. Neglect patients showed an overall rightward bias, larger than those of patients without neglect and controls. The neglect patients' bias was modulated by stimulus type, decreasing from lines, to letter strings and to all types of sentences. In sum, in visuo-manual sentence bisection a basic linguistic mechanism, such as sentence readability, brings about a more leftward appreciation of the stimulus, reducing the neglect patients' rightward bias.

Zn(II) sequestration by fungal biogenic manganese oxide through enzymatic and abiotic processes,"Chang, JN; Tani, Y; Naitou, H; Miyata, N; Tojo, F; Seyama, H","Here, we examined the ability of biogenic manganese oxide (BMO), formed in the cultures of a Mn(II) oxidizing fungus Acremonium strictum strain KR21-2, to sequester Zn(II) in the presence and absence of extra Mn(II) and found that BMOs sequester Zn(II) through various paths involving enzymatic and abiotic processes. Newly formed BMOs were observed to effectively sequester Zn(II), with virtually no release of Mn(II), when treated with Zn(II) in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulphonic acid (HEPES) buffer (pH 7.0) under aerobic conditions. Under anaerobic conditions, smaller amounts of Zn(II) were sequestered, whereas a significant amount of Mn(II) was released. Similar trends were observed when the BMOs were heated at 85 degrees C for 1 h to inactivate the Mn(II) oxidase associatedwith the BMOs. Combined with a two-step extraction of the resulting solid phase, these results demonstrated that the Mn(II) oxidase associated with BMOs can oxidize Mn(II) which is released through an ion exchange at the BMO surface and can subsequently reduce the competition for sorption with released Mn(II). Assays using the concentrated Mn(II) oxidase crude solution indicated that coexisting Zn(II) had a decreased inhibitory effect on enzymatic Mn(II) oxidation if the preformed Mn oxide phase was present. XRD revealed that no alteration of the bulk structure occurred after Zn(II) treatment under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. When the newly formed BMOs were repeatedly treated with mixed solutions of Zn(II) and Mn(II), the Mn(II) was effectively oxidized to an oxide phase, thereby sequestering Zn(II). The XRD of the resulting solid phases indicated the formation of woodruffite ((ZnMn3O7)-O-IV center dot 2H(2)O) in addition to the original vernadite (birnessite) structure, which suggested that ongoing Mn(II) oxidation by the associated Mn(II) oxidase in the presence of Zn(II) may participate in the formation of mixed Zn-Mn oxide phases. Following repeated treatment of the heated BMOs in the mixed Zn(II)/Mn(II) solution at a Mn(II)/Zn(II) ratio of similar to 4.0, the resulting solid phase possessed well-defined XRD peaks consistent with hetaerolite ((ZnMn2O4)-O-III) formation through an abiotic comproportionation reaction between added Mn(II) and structural Mn(IV). With a decrease in the Mn(II)/Zn(II) ratio in the bathing solution, the XRD peaks weakened and shifted toward a pattern that was identified as hydrohetaerolite rather than hetaerolite. Thus, the higher concentration of Zn(II) relative to Mn(II) in the bathing solution may have inhibited the proper formation of crystalline hetaerolite. No comproportionation reaction occurred in the absence of Zn(II) under the evaluated experimental conditions (pH 7.0, similar to 1 mM added Mn(II)), indicating that Zn(II) triggered the comproportionation reaction at the BMO surface. The results presented here increase our understanding of the role of BMO in Zn(II) sequestration through microbial (enzymatic) and abiotic processes in natural environments and provide new insights into the application of enzymatically active BMOs for Zn(II) removal processes.

Feasibility of utilising an all-volunteer workforce as a disruptive innovation for the US obesity epidemic,"Kraschnewski, JL; Hwang, KO; George, DR; Lehman, EB; Sciamanna, CN","Objectives: As the prevalence of obesity in US adults continues to increase, addressing weight control will require an effective, lower-cost intervention. A model for delivering free peer-to-peer counselling has the potential to create a paradigm shift in the way weight and other chronic illnesses are addressed in the US. The objective of this study is to understand the potential for utilising successful peer volunteers as counsellors in weight control programmes and as a possible intervention strategy to address the global obesity epidemic in a cost-effective manner. Study design: This cross-sectional study surveyed a nationwide panel of US adults (n=806) in 2010.Methods: We created survey items to identify participant interest in three specific types of weight control programmes: a free programme led by successful peers, a paid programme led by successful peers and a programme led by trained paid professionals. Statistical analysis was conducted in 2011. Logistic regression was used to adjust for the effect of potential confounders on participant interest in different weight control programmes and willingness to volunteer.Results: More than three times as many subjects (27.4% vs. 8.3%) were interested in the free peer-led programme versus the expert-led paid option. Of participants who had ever had successful weight loss, 15% were interested in volunteering to help others lose weight.Conclusions: Individuals appear to be willing to both attend and conduct peer volunteer-led weight control groups. Further research is necessary to develop and test interventions to assess the effectiveness of such interventions. (C) 2014 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.

Association between abdominal fat distribution and atherosclerotic changes in the carotid artery,"Oike, M; Yokokawa, H; Fukuda, H; Haniu, T; Oka, F; Hisaoka, T; Isonuma, H","Aim: We aimed to evaluate the association between abdominal fat distribution (e.g., abdominal visceral fat area [VFA], subcutaneous fat area [SEA], and total fat area [TEA]), waist circumference (WC), or body mass index (BMI) and atherosclerotic changes in the carotid artery after adjusting for common risk factors.Methods: The present study is a hospital-based, cross-sectional study. Study participants included 223 Japanese individuals who underwent a medical health checkup at Juntendo University Hospital, Tokyo, between December 2005 and August 2011. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between abdominal VFA, SEA, TEA, the VFA/SFA ratio, WC, or BMI and intima-media thickness [IMT] (mean IMT >= 1.1 mm or maximum IMT >= 1.2 mm) as atherosclerotic changes in the carotid artery.Results: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that VFA (OR for >150 cm2 versus <100 cm(2), 3.88; 95% CI, 1.39-10.85), BMI (OR for >= 27.6 kg/m(2) versus <25 kg/m2, 5.22; 95% CI, 1.69-16.16), and TEA (OR for 200-285 cm(2) versus <200 cm2, 4.15; 95% CI, 1.34-12.86: OR for >285 cm(2) versus <200 cm(2), 5.53; 95% CI, 1.76-17.35) were significantly associated with atherosclerotic changes in men. After adjustment for BMI, only TEA (OR for >285 cm(2) versus <200 cm(2), 3.76; 95%Cl, 1.03-13.79) in men was significantly associated with atherosclerotic changes in the carotid artery.Conclusions: Our results indicate that VFA, TFA, and BMI are independently associated with atherosclerotic changes in Japanese men.

Consumer beliefs regarding farmed versus wild fish,"Claret, A; Guerrero, L; Gines, R; Grau, A; Hernandez, MD; Aguirre, E; Peleteiro, JB; Fernandez-Pato, C; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, C","Aquaculture is a food-producing activity, alternative to traditional extractive fishing, which still acts as a reference for most consumers. The main objective of the present paper was to study which consumer beliefs, regarding farmed versus wild fish, hinder the potential development of the aquaculture sector. To achieve this purpose the study was organized into two complementary steps: a qualitative approach (focus groups) aimed at assessing consumer perception about wild and farmed fish and to identify the salient beliefs that differentiate them; and a quantitative approach (survey by means of a questionnaire) to validate the results obtained in the focus group discussions over a representative sample of participants (n = 919). Results showed that participants perceive clear differences between farmed and wild fish. Although no significant differences between both kinds of fish were detected on safety, in general farmed fish was perceived to be less affected by marine pollution, heavy metals and parasites. In the contrary, wild fish was considered to have healthier feeding, to contain fewer antibiotics and to be fresher, healthier, less handled and more natural. Beliefs related to quality were in favour of wild fish, while those related to availability and price were in favour of farmed fish. Significant differences were observed in the perception of both kinds of fish depending on the consumers' objective knowledge about fish, on the level of education, age and gender and on the three segments of consumers identified: ""Traditional/Conservative"", ""Connoisseur"", ""Open to aquaculture"". The results provided could play an important role when planning and designing efficient marketing strategies for promoting farmed fish by adapting the information provided to the perception of each segment of consumers identified by the present study (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"A temporal accessibility model for assessing the ability of search and rescue in Nansha Islands, South China Sea","Shi, W; Su, FZ; Zhou, CH","Time is an indispensable means in accessibility expression and also an important index of the search and rescue (SAR) ability to a country. In this paper, a method for forecasting the location and probability of patrol vessel which is responsible for SAR on the sea is presented; and a temporal accessibility model for assessing the SAR ability of countries around South China Sea in Nansha is structured. In this study, 19 islands and cays in Nansha Islands are selected as rescue targets; eight ports in four countries around South China Sea are selected as SAR bases: patrol vessels belong to coast guard or maritime agency of countries around South China Sea whose displacement is over 1000 tons are selected as principal searchers and rescuers. Based on the density of ships passing the area and the distance from ports of each homeland, the distributions of patrol vessel which belongs to four countries around South China Sea are obtained. The SAR time of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Philippines in Nansha were calculated based on the proposed method. The results indicated that due to the number of big patrol vessels, China Coast Guard is able to get to Nansha in minimum time, only half an hour for SAR; Vietnam gets second, one and a half hours; Malaysia gets third, 4.6 h; Philippines costs almost 7 h at the bottom of the list, because of the distance and the number of vessels. Taking consideration of the scattered distribution of islands, rocky coral reefs, bad weather and complex marine conditions, it is a very difficult job for SAR vessels. So it is necessary to set up several sub centers and shelters on appropriate islands or atolls in Nansha. And more importantly, how to enhance connection and coordination among countries around South China Sea, build harmonious and smooth SAR mechanisms or channels for cooperation, and improve the ability for solving emergency accidents in Nansha and even the whole South China Sea.

Evaluating Meaningful Watershed Educational Experiences: An exploration into the effects on participating students' environmental stewardship characteristics and the relationships between these predictors of environmentally responsible behavior,"Zint, M; Kraemer, A; Kolenic, G","This study evaluated Meaningful Watershed Educational Experiences (MWEEs) funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Chesapeake Bay Watershed Education and Training (B-WET) grant program. It also empirically explores the relationships between predictors of environmentally responsible behavior (ERB) in the Hines, Hungerford, and Tomera (1986/1987) and Hungerford and Volk (1990) behavior models. Multilevel analyses identified associations between eight environmental stewardship characteristics, as well as between these outcomes and (1) participation in MWEEs (sample: 258 students in 20 treatment classes, 193 students in 12 comparison classes matched by grade) and (2) specific MWEE instructional practices (sample: 434 students in 29 treatment classes). Students who participated in MWEEs scored significantly higher in five of eight characteristics (i.e., knowledge of ecology, issues, and actions, individual locus of control, intention to act) than those in the comparison group. Students who were engaged in the science inquiry steps of analyzing data or reflection and those who participated in more of certain types of environmental actions also scored significantly higher in a greater number of environmental stewardship characteristics than students who did not have these experiences. Results suggest that MWEEs are likely to increase ERBs but are not reaching their full potential. Tests of the relationships between the variables in Hines et al. (1986/1987) and Hungerford and Volk (1990) models confirm that they predict a high amount of variance in intention to act and suggest that environmental stewardship characteristics are likely to interact in complex ways.

How full is your luggage? Background knowledge of zoo visitors regarding sharks,"das Neves, JPC; Monteiro, RCR","For the general population, sharks have a reputation that does not really fit with their biological and ecological nature. Informal surveys often classify sharks as dangerous, aggressive and/or man-eaters. This apparent common knowledge seems difficult to detach from the conscience of many worldwide zoo visitors, even with the help of shark-focused educational programmes. As so, how can zoos and aquariums contribute to a change in this paradigm? Are the education and conservation strategies effective to the average zoo visitor? In this study, young visitors' perceptions regarding sharks were assessed with the goal of identifying a valid Learning Progression, thus helping to update and develop different and more effective educational strategies and methodologies. The study took place at Zoomarine, an oceanographic park located in southern Portugal, with visitors aged between 8 and 16. A case study was conducted using a qualitative research approach (drawings and interviews) resulting in a Learning Progression Hypothesis. The proposed Learning Progression is composed of three knowledge levels for the participants' biological perceptions regarding sharks. The results of this study showed a clear predominance of anthropomorphic and anthropocentric visions, as well as a utilitarian view of sharks and ecosystem, thus conditioning the visitors' epistemological knowledge.",2014,,ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH,20,3,291-312,WOS:000333951100001,10.1080/13504622.2013.780586,,#20250,dasNeves 2014,,

Age adjusted data for anthropometric indices and diabetes risk were assessed and their relationships were examined.Results: Age adjusted prevalence of DM in men and women were 9.5% and 7.0%, respectively. Both men and women with DM had a higher rate of general obesity (defined by BMI) and central obesity (defined by WC, WHR and WHtR) than non-diabetic subjects. In both men and women the most sensitive indice was WHR for predicting DM. The appropriate cut-offs values for WHR to predict DM in men and women were 0.93 and 0.87, respectively. WC of 82 cm for both sexes was appropriate to predict DM. Those of BMI and WHtR were 21.2 kg/m(2), 21.8 kg/m(2) and 0.53, 0.54 in men and women, respectively.Conclusions: Compared with BMI, measures of central obesity, WHR, WC, WHtR showed a better association with the risk of DM for both sexes in rural Bangladeshi population.

Validation of prediction equations for resting energy expenditure in Singaporean Chinese men,"Song, T; Venkataraman, K; Gluckman, P; Seng, CY; Meng, KC; Khoo, EYH; Leow, MKS; Seng, LY; Shyong, TE","Accurate prediction of resting energy expenditure (REE) is important in establishing adequate dietary intake goals for effective weight management. Previous studies have shown that the validity of an energy prediction equation may depend on the ethnicity of the population. Validation studies are lacking in the Singaporean Chinese population. A total of 96 healthy Singaporean Chinese males of age 21-40 years and body mass index (BMI) 18.5-30.0 kg/m(2) participated in this study. REE was measured by indirect calorimetry and compared with REE predicted using existing equations. Validity was evaluated on the basis of mean bias and percentage of subjects predicted within +/- 10% of REE measured. In addition, Bland and Altman analyses were performed. No significant difference was observed between the mean Levels of measured and predicted REE derived from the Owen equation. The Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization/United Nations University (FAO/WHO/UNU), Harris-Benedict and Mifflin equations significantly overestimated the mean measured REE by 7.5%, 6.0% and 2.4% respectively. Percentage of valid predictions for FAO/WHO/UNU, Harris-Benedict, Mifflin and Owen equations were 60%, 67%, 75% and 73% respectively. Bland and Altman analyses demonstrated poor agreement for all equations. The Owen equation provided a valid estimation of REE in Singaporean Chinese men at a group level. However, the individual errors of the equations were unacceptable high and may have limited utility in making clinical decisions on nutritional requirements.

Heightened vagal activity during high-calorie food presentation in obese compared with non-obese individuals-Results of a pilot study,"Udo, T; Weinberger, AH; Grilo, CM; Brownell, KD; DiLeone, RJ; Lampert, R; Matlin, SL; Yanagisawa, K; McKee, SA","Eating behaviours are highly cue-dependent. Changes in mood states and exposure to palatable food both increase craving and consumption of food. Vagal activity supports adaptive modulation of physiological arousal and has an important role in cue-induced appetitive behaviours. Using high-frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), this preliminary study compared vagal activity during positive and negative mood induction, and presentation of preferred high-calorie food items between obese (n = 12; BMI >= 30) and non-obese individuals (n = 14; 18.5 < BMI < 30). Participants completed two laboratory sessions (negative vs. positive mood conditions). Following 3-h of food deprivation, all participants completed a mood induction, and then were exposed to their preferred high-calorie food items. HF HRV was assessed throughout. Obese and non-obese individuals were not significantly different in HF HRV during positive or negative mood induction. Obese individuals showed significantly greater levels of HF HRV during presentation of their preferred high-calorie food items than non-obese individuals, particularly in the positive mood condition. This is the first study to demonstrate increased vagal activity in response to food cues in obese individuals compared with non-obese individuals. Our findings warrant further investigation on the potential role of vagally-mediated cue reactivity in overeating and obesity. (C) 2013 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.

We thus aimed to assess the relation between dietary intake of total omega-3 fatty acids (from plant and marine foods) and marine polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), on the risk of CHD in the Spanish cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).Methods and results: The analysis included 41,091 men and women aged 20-69 years, recruited from 1992 to 1996 and followed-up until December 2004. Omega-3 fatty acid intake was estimated from a validated dietary questionnaire. Only participants with definite incident CHD event were considered as cases. Cox regression models were used to assess the association between the intake of total omega-3 fatty acids, EPA or DHA and CHD. A total of 609 participants (79% men) had a definite CHD event. Mean intakes of total omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA were very similar in the cases and in the cohort, both in men and women. In the multivariate adjusted model, omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA were not related to incident CHD in either men or women. The hazard ratios (HR) for omega-3 were 1.23 in men (95% CI 0.94-15.9, p = 0.20); and 0.77 in women (95% CI 0.46-1.30, p = 0.76).Conclusion: In the Spanish EPIC cohort, with a relatively high intake of fish, no association was found between EPA, DHA and total omega-3 fatty acid intake and risk of CHD.

Associations between adolescent and adult socioeconomic status and risk of obesity and overweight in Danish adults,"Boylan, SM; Gill, TP; Hare-Bruun, H; Andersen, LB; Heitmann, BL","Background: It has been suggested that socioeconomic status (SES) may influence the risk of obesity; however it is important to consider individual changes in SES over the life-course in addition to SES at specific time-points to better understand the complex associations with obesity. We explored the relationship between lifetimespecific and life-course SES and risk of obesity and overweight in Danish adults.Methods: Data were used from the Danish Youth and Sports Study (DYSS) a 20-22 year follow-up study of Danish teenagers born between 1964 and 1969. Baseline data gathered in 1983 and 1985 included self-reported BMI, SES and physical activity. The follow-up survey (2005) repeated these assessments in addition to an assessment of diet. Complete data on adolescent and adult SES and BMI were available for 623 participants.Results: Following adjustments, adolescent SES had no significant association with overweight/obesity in this sample, however females of low or medium adult SES were significantly more likely to be overweight/obese compared to those of high SES (low SES: OR: 2.7; 95% CI: (1.3-5.8); p = 0.008; medium SES: OR: 4.0, 95% CI (1.6-10.2); p = 0.003). Females who decreased in SES during adulthood were significantly more likely to be overweight/obese compared to those who remained of high SES (OR: 3.1; 95% CI (1.1-9.2); p = 0.04).Conclusion: Effects of early life-factors may be conditional upon the environment in adulthood, particularly for the women. Further research should consider the timing of SES exposure and the mechanisms which may be responsible for the socioeconomic gradients in prevalence of obesity and overweight.

Unjust and unsustainable: A case study of the Acu port industrial complex,"Ditty, JM; Rezende, CE","Given their potential for social and ecosystem disruption along with job creation and economic stimulus, the proliferation of extremely large-scale investment projects worldwide has created a dilemma for policymakers and public authorities. Although one method of balancing the varied interests of stakeholders is to require that development projects be sustainable, the definition of this concept has become muddled and few practical frameworks for its implementation have emerged. One strategy that does exist, however, is the just sustainability framework. The present study sought to assess the just sustainability of the Acu industrial seaport megaproject in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil through the application of a questionnaire among 60 active marine artisan fishers of a nearby community. The results indicate that the megaproject was not sustainable. Furthermore, the results of the just sustainability indicators triangulated both with the study's primary fisher ethnographic data and with peer-reviewed scientific assessments of similar projects, thus confirming the potential value of the just sustainability framework for assessment and policy formulation.

Climate change awareness and strategies for communicating the risk of coastal flooding: A Canadian Maritime case example,"Lieske, DJ; Wade, T; Roness, LA","Rising sea levels, due to thermal expansion of the ocean, and higher frequency and intensity of coastal and inland storms threaten coastal communities worldwide. The implementation of pro-active, planned adaptation to reduce community vulnerability is strongly dependent upon people's perception of the threat posed to their communities at the local scale. Unfortunately, the scarcity of research into effective risk communication limits our understanding of how climate change evidence can most effectively raise risk awareness and inspire community adaptation.With a focus on a case study situated in the Tantramar area of South-East New Brunswick, Canada an area subject to very large tidal forces from the Bay of Fundy this study set out to assess public awareness about the link between climate change and elevated risk of regional dyke failure, measure how different multi-media visualizations influence public risk perception, and provide general recommendations for the development of flood risk communication strategies in coastal zones.The results from 14 focus groups (n = 157 participants) revealed that 81% of respondents felt that the problem of climate change was considerable or severe. However, when asked for their assessment of personal vulnerability to dyke failure and subsequent coastal flooding, only 35.6% considered themselves to be at considerable or severe personal risk. Gender, education, and age were found to significantly influence initial risk perception to varying degrees, and were also associated with changes in risk perception following the communication session. While geovisually-enhanced communication strategies, involving 3D flood animations and web-based GIS maps, were no more effective at raising risk awareness than a non-enhanced communication package, qualitative responses suggested that the geovisualizations had greater emotional impact (""shock""), and contributed disproportionately to an expressed desire to become politically and socially active around the issue. In conclusion, in addition to presenting evidence in a clear and compelling way, effective coastal flood risk communication requires a supportive framework capable of building trust and encouraging public dialogue. Recommendations towards creating this framework are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Harmful routines? Uncertainty in science and conflicting views on routine petroleum operations in Norway,"Blanchard, A; Hauge, KH; Andersen, G; Fossa, JH; Grosvik, BE; Handegard, NO; Kaiser, M; Meier, S; Olsen, E; Vikebo, F","Offshore petroleum activities are the focus of highly politicised debates globally. Typically, public debate is sparked by catastrophic events, such as the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and decision-making processes fuelled by the assessment of 'worst-case scenarios'. However, everyday 'routine' petroleum operations also impact the marine ecosystems and adjoining socio-economic sectors, but the extent and severity of the impacts are uncertain. This paper takes as its point of departure routine operations and their surrounding uncertainties. Particularly, it focuses on the debates of whether to extend routine petroleum operations in vulnerable and valuable parts of Norway, such as the Lofoten area and the Sula Ridge. These conflicts draw on important and for some, epistemological uncertainties that surround the impacts of routine operations. The paper argues that it is necessary to first highlight these uncertainties, rather than marginalise them, and second, recognise that uncertainties are not simply a scientific challenge, but can be a powerful political tool. This paper unpacks and explores uncertainties associated with three phases of routine operations, that are used to steer political actions: (i) the impacts of seismic surveys on fish and marine mammals; (ii) the impacts of drilling mud and drill cuttings on benthic communities such as deep-sea coral reefs; and (iii) the impacts of produced water on the marine environment. The paper discusses the importance of transparency in addressing these uncertainties, and emphasises the need to implement the precautionary principle in a more participatory way.

Parental feeding patterns and child weight status for Latino preschoolers,"Karp, SM; Barry, KM; Gesell, SB; Po'e, EK; Dietrich, MS; Barkin, SL","Objective: To examine the relationships between parental patterns regarding child feeding and child body mass index (BMI) percentile in Latino parent-preschooler dyads participating in a clinical trial.Methods: This secondary analysis examined data collected during a randomized clinical trial of a culturally tailored healthy lifestyle intervention focused on childhood obesity prevention, Salud Con La Familia. We analyzed 77 Latino parent-child dyads who completed baseline and 3-month follow-up data collection, assessing associations between preschool child BMI percentile and parental response to the Child Feeding Questionnaire (CFQ) over time.Results: Higher child BMI was related to higher parental CFQ concern scores (r = 0.41, p < .001). A general inverse association between child BMI percentile and parental responsibility was also observed (r = -0.23, p = .040). Over the 3-month period, no statistically significant associations between changes in the CFQ subscale scores and changes in child BMI percentile were identified.Conclusions: Child BMI percentile consistent with overweight/obese is associated with parental concern about child weight and child BMI percentile consistent with normal weight is associated with perceived responsibility for feeding. Emphasizing parental responsibility to help children to develop healthy eating habits could be an important aspect of interventions aimed at both preventing and reducing pediatric obesity for Latino preschoolers.

Carbon reduction scenarios for 2050: An explorative analysis of public preferences,"Allen, P; Chatterton, T","This paper presents an analysis of public preferences for a low carbon future UK and compares them with three future scenarios proposed by the UK government based on data from 10,983 self-selected participants who engaged in the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change 'My2050' online simulation. Participants expressed a stronger preference for demand-side options than for supply-side ones. They also chose fuel switching (to electricity) and technical energy efficiency measures above more behaviour focused options. Renewable energy options (wind, solar, marine and hydro) were preferred to other low carbon supply options (nuclear power, carbon capture and storage), with offshore wind power more popular than onshore. Nuclear power was the least popular generation option. Acceptability of the government's three proposed scenarios was tested by comparing these scenarios with the research findings. Greatest support was suggested for the two scenarios emphasising business greenness, home energy efficiency, electrification of home heating and travel behaviour. The lowest level of support was demonstrated for the scenario based on significant growth in nuclear power with minimal increases in energy efficiency. Despite issues regarding the representivity of the sampled respondents, the work demonstrates the possibility of using outputs from the tool to assess publically preferred pathways.

Review of the legal aspects of environmental management in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand,"Basiron, MN; Lexmond, SM","The mandate of the Legal Task Force established under the South China Sea project was to evaluate the present status of legal environmental instruments at national, sub-regional and regional levels with a view to exploring ways to strengthen regional co-operation in the environmental management of the South China Sea. This article provides an overview of: signatory states' obligations for regional cooperation under major global environmental conventions; the status of existing regional co-operative mechanisms and instruments, including regional agreements and 'soft' laws(1); national environmental legislation; and an analysis of national environmental legislation regarding major issues and themes of interest. This article demonstrates that, while the global and international conventions to which the countries of the South China Sea are parties convey obligations on the states to co-operate regionally, this obligation has generally not been met. In addition, there is no single legally-binding regional intergovernmental agreement on marine environmental protection that involves all the countries bordering the South China Sea. This review indicates that, while all countries have a suite of legal instruments designed to protect the environment and conserve natural resources, these are often not harmonised and integrated with national policies. Countries continue to be without an integrated coastal/marine management policy that sets clear priorities, principles and guidelines that can steer policy conflicts towards resolution and encourage government agencies and offices to see themselves as part of a larger effort towards proper management of coastal and marine habitats.The article concludes with a review of potential mechanisms for future regional co-operation in environmental management and proposes alternative models. Lessons learned from the global community and regional programmes indicate a growing emphasis on the domestic implementation of global instruments via regional co-operative initiatives and maximising effectiveness. An emerging trend is the proliferation of calls to 'strategically' address these two needs. This suggests that an appropriate course of action for a region seeking to strengthen co-operation would be forging a legal agreement that suits regional needs and interests and, in so doing, incorporates 'effectiveness' into the design.It is further concluded that the SCS region is in a unique and enviable position. Unlike most other regions, it has never adopted a legally-binding instrument and, consequently, it is free of precedent and other legal baggage. Regional co-operation is gaining momentum and South China Sea states are indicating a greater concern for environmental sustainability. There is also a growing recognition that the inefficient use of resources will only worsen without horizontal and vertical co-ordination and regional co-operation. It seems an appropriate time to consider an effective and region-appropriate course for long-term sustainability of the South China Sea and its resources, including consideration of a regional framework for co-operation, co-ordination and communication. Political commitment will determine whether any new co-operative framework becomes a paper tiger or an Asian tiger. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Making an environmental market, unmaking adaptive capacity: Species commodification in the New England groundfishery","Brewer, JF","This article demonstrates how market-focused natural resource management can reduce adaptive capacity to environmental change. It describes attempts to standardize socio-ecological phenomena in the New England groundfishery for purposes of legal accountability and the development of environmental markets. Industry flexibility across harvested species has supported a range of informal social networks for the exchange of information and other goods and services. Federal catch share policy, associated species population assessments, and transferable harvest quotas neglect social and ecological diversity that figure centrally in adaptation strategies. New quota markets generate a cascade of impacts, including intensified capital investment, threats of industry consolidation, increased reliance on limited capabilities of fisheries science, more acute regulatory uncertainties, narrowing of species options, smaller and less predictable profit margins, shifts in industry expectations for the future, and changes in fishing practice. Presumed market incentives for resource conservation are weakened. State and non-profit interventions to protect marine resources and local fishing-dependent collectivities may have limited immediate impact, but still play important roles in the longer term. Permit banks, alternative seafood marketing, and reformist regulatory proposals maintain institutional diversity and invigorate informal social relations capable of decentralized information sharing and collective action, which are essential to more adaptive environmental governance.

Voluntary institutions and behaviours as alternatives to formal regulations in recreational fisheries management,"Cooke, SJ; Suski, CD; Arlinghaus, R; Danylchuk, AJ","Traditional regulatory options (formal institutions) imposed by government agencies such as harvest and gear restrictions represent the standard in recreational fisheries management, at least in developed countries. However, there exist a number of alternatives including the use of angler education programmes that attempt to evoke voluntary changes in angler behaviour, resulting in the emergence of voluntarily motivated resource-conserving informal institutions. These softer' approaches to aquatic stewardship and fisheries management can be developed in cooperation with stakeholders and in many cases are led by avid anglers and angling groups. Examples of such measures include voluntary sanctuaries, informally enforced seasonal closures, personal daily bag limits, self-imposed constraints on gear, development of entirely live-release fisheries, and adoption of fish and aquatic ecosystem conservation-oriented gears and release practices. Education efforts that provide anglers with knowledge on best practices and empower them to modify their behaviour hold great promise to meet formal management goals and objectives, but seem to be underutilized relative to formal regulations. This article highlights the benefits and challenges of relying on informal institutions as alternatives to traditional regulatory options. Informal institutions that protect resources and help overfished stocks recover hold great promise in both developed and developing countries, particularly when there is a single stakeholder group or when the capacity to enforce traditional regulations or to invest in stock assessments is limited. Informal institutions may help make formal institutions more effective or can even be alternatives to costly institutions that depend on enforcement to be effective.",2013,,FISH AND FISHERIES,14,4,439-457,WOS:000326027100001,10.1111/j.1467-2979.2012.00477.x,,#20265,Cooke 2013,,
Synthesis and Neuroprotective Action of Xyloketal Derivatives in Parkinson's Disease Models,"Li, SC; Shen, CZ; Guo, WY; Zhang, XF; Liu, SX; Liang, FY; Xu, ZL; Pei, Z; Song, HC; Qiu, LQ; Lin, YC; Pang, JY","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting people over age 55. Oxidative stress actively participates in the dopaminergic (DA) neuron degeneration of PD. Xyloketals are a series of natural compounds from marine mangrove fungus strain No. 2508 that have been reported to protect against neurotoxicity through their antioxidant properties. However, their protection versus 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced neurotoxicity is only modest, and appropriate structural modifications are necessary to discover better candidates for treating PD. In this work, we designed and synthesized 39 novel xyloketal derivatives (1-39) in addition to the previously reported compound, xyloketal B. The neuroprotective activities of all 40 compounds were evaluated in vivo via respiratory burst assays and longevity-extending assays. During the zebrafish respiratory burst assay, compounds 1, 9, 23, 24, 36 and 39 strongly attenuated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation at 50 M. In the Caenorhabditis elegans longevity-extending assay, compounds 1, 8, 15, 16 and 36 significantly extended the survival rates (p < 0.005 vs. dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)). A total of 15 compounds were tested for the treatment of Parkinson's disease using the MPP+-induced C. elegans model, and compounds 1 and 8 exhibited the highest activities (p < 0.005 vs. MPP+). In the MPP+-induced C57BL/6 mouse PD model, 40 mg/kg of 1 and 8 protected against MPP+-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration and increased the number of DA neurons from 53% for the MPP+ group to 78% and 74%, respectively (p < 0.001 vs. MPP+ group).

Prevention of childhood obesity: Recruiting strategies via local paediatricians and study protocol for a telephone-based counselling programme,"Markert, J; Alff, F; Zschaler, S; Gausche, R; Kiess, W; Bluher, S","Aim: Prevention research has to elucidate how families with overweight children can be convinced to participate in obesity intervention trials. Here we describe the detailed recruitment process for a telephone-based obesity prevention programme for families with overweight children and present participation rates, the study design and a socio-demographic description of participating families.Methods: Overweight (BMI > 90th percentile) children and adolescents 4-17 years of age were screened via the German paediatrician network CrescNet. The prevention programme (multiple computer aided telephone counselling interviews) was suggested to eligible families via local paediatricians. Participating families were compared anthropometrically and socio-demographically to the entire screening population and to micro-census data, a representative national survey.Results: The screening process assessed 4005 candidates for eligibility. Paediatricians reported having suggested programme participation to 3387 candidates( referred to as 100%). 427 candidates (12.6%) returned a written consent for programme participation. 303 candidates (9.0%) started the intervention. The study population (n = 303) included more obese ( 45.6% vs. 33.2%; p < 0.001) and fewer overweight participants (40.4% vs. 55.2%; p < 0.001) than the entire screening population. Compared to the micro-census, families with adolescents (8.2% vs. 16.9%; p < 0.001) and single parents (16.0% vs. 23.3%; p < 0.005) were underrepresented in the study population, whereas families living in rural areas were overrepresented (58.7% vs. 50.2%; p < 0.005).Conclusions: Although 84.6% of the paediatricians forwarded the suggestion for programme participation to eligible families, participation rates for this low-threshold; telephone-based obesity intervention remained very low.

Measuring experiential avoidance in a bariatric surgery population-Psychometric properties of AAQ-W,"Weineland, S; Lillis, J; Dahl, J","Background: Valid measures capturing underlying psychological processes post surgery for obesity are needed to help identify important clinical targets and develop psychosocial interventions in conjunction with surgery. The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire for Weight (AAQ-W) measures experiential avoidance and has never been evaluated in a bariatric surgery population.Method: Participants were recruited at a bariatric surgery clinic during follow-up care. The evaluation of psychometric properties of AAQ-W was done by repeated measurements of reliability (n = 62), convergent validity (n = 75 and n = 178), predictive validity (n = 61), factor analysis and calculation of internal consistency (n = 178).Results: The AAQ-W was found to have satisfactory psychometric properties. Internal consistency was high (alpha = .86). Results showed good stability over time (r = .77) and validity coefficients ranging from r = .36 to .71. AAQ-W scores measured six months post surgery predicted satisfaction with life, negative emotional states, emotional eating and general eating pathology measured one year post surgery. However AAQ-W measured at six months did not predict percent excess BMI Loss at one year. Factor analysis showed that a five factor solution (Food as Control, Body Acceptance, Self-Stigma, Self-Efficacy and Emotional Avoidance) might be a good fit (n = 178).Conclusion: This study shows that the AAQ-W appears to be a psychometrically sound measure that can be used by researchers and clinicians in the context of bariatric surgery.

The Portuguese maritime spatial plan,"Calado, H; Bentz, J","Numerous national governments and supranational organizations such as the OSPAR Commission, the European Union and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) have underlined the importance of maritime spatial planning (MSP) for balancing and solving conflicts between the needs of different sectors and conservation in the marine space. In the last decade, many maritime spatial plans have been developed around the world. The drivers to develop these plans and the approaches to find solutions for the particular problems differ significantly. The Portuguese national marine jurisdiction is one of the largest in Europe. For the continental part, a maritime spatial plan was initiated in 2009, and entered in 2010 in the final stage of approval. One of the driving forces for this MSP initiative was the claim to extend its continental shelf. The development process was led by a multidisciplinary team. Despite the challenges, the existing as well as potential future marine resources and activities were characterized, mapped and categorized. To overcome conflicts resulting from the many overlapping uses and to assure sustainable development of all sectors, a conflict analysis and evaluation of potential future uses were necessary. The applied zoning scheme represented an exercise of conflict solving and proved to be a powerful tool to promote discussion and participation among stakeholders. The successful implementation of Portuguese MSP will rely largely on its ability to provide efficient management, financial and legal mechanisms to achieve the integration of all strategies and spaces under the Portuguese maritime jurisdiction.

"Whale interactions with Alaskan sablefish and Pacific halibut fisheries: Surveying fishermen perception, changing fishing practices and mitigation","Peterson, MJ; Carothers, C","Whale depredation occurs when whales steal fish, damage fish or damage fishing gear. In Alaska, killer whales (Orcinus orca) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) primarily depredate on demersal sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) longline fisheries. Quantitative data on whale depredation in Alaska is limited due to low fishery observer coverage and minimal depredation evidence left on longline fishing gear. This study utilized semidirected interviews (n=70) and written questionnaires (n=95) with longline fishermen to examine: (I) perceptions and experiences of whale-fishery interactions in Alaska, (2) effects of depredation on fishing practices, and (3) potential depredation mitigation measures. Eighty-seven percent of fishermen surveyed agreed that whale depredation became worse between 1990 and 2010. Respondents reported changing their fishing practices in response to depredating whales in several ways, including: traveling up to 50 nautical miles and ceasing hauling operations up to 24 h until the whales left the fishing grounds. Respondents fishing in western Alaska, primarily encountering killer whales, were forced to wait longer and travel greater distances than fishermen operating in central and southeast Alaska, regions more affected by sperm whales. Deterrent research, gear modifications and real-time tracking of depredating whales were solutions favored by study participants. Survey respondent answers varied based on areas fished, quota owned, years involved in the fishery and vessel size. This study presents the first statewide evaluation of fishermen's perception and knowledge of whale interactions with the Alaskan longline fleet and is a critical step toward developing baseline data and feasible depredation mitigation strategies.

'Opening up' geoengineering appraisal: Multi-Criteria Mapping of options for tackling climate change,"Bellamy, R; Chilvers, J; Vaughan, NE; Lenton, TM","Concerted efforts have begun to appraise deliberate, large-scale interventions in the Earth's climate system known as 'geoengineering' in order to provide critical decision support to policy makers around the world. To date geoengineering appraisals have employed narrowly framed inputs (such as context, options, methods and criteria) and 'closed' output reflexivity often amounting to unitary and prescriptive policy recommendations. For the first time, in this paper we begin to address these limitations by 'opening up' appraisal inputs and outputs to a wider diversity of framings, knowledges and future pathways. We use a Multi-Criteria Mapping methodology to appraise carbon and solar geoengineering proposals alongside a range of other options for responding to climate change with a select but diverse group of experts and stakeholders. Overall option rankings are found to vary considerably between participant perspectives and criteria. Despite these differences, the ranks of geoengineering proposals are most often lower than options for mitigating climate change (including voluntary behaviour change and low carbon technologies). The performance of all options is beset by uncertainty, albeit to differing degrees, and it can often be seen that better performing options are outperformed under their pessimistic scores by poorer performing options under their optimistic scores. Several findings contrast with those of other published appraisals. In particular, where stratospheric aerosol injection has previously outperformed other geoengineering options, when assessed against a broader diversity of criteria (spanning all the identified criteria groups) and other options for responding to climate change it performs relatively poorly. We end by briefly exploring the implications of our analysis for geoengineering technologies, their governance, and appraisal. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

They present the set-up of and insights from a game-based, quasi-experimental study and policy intervention involving MSP. The simulation game MSP Challenge 2011 was played in Lisbon on 3 November 2011 by 68 international MSP professionals mainly scientists, policy advisers and marine spatial planners from 16 countries. Data on MSP in the various countries, as well as on the effectiveness of the policy intervention, were collected using pre-game, in-game and post-game questionnaires, combined with the analysis of MSP processes and outcomes in a digital map tool and observations. The analysis shows that MSP lends itself to comparative assessment in real and simulated environments. Observed variety and changes in the game-based intervention provide evidence that the participants engaged in experimentation with different strategies, policy change and policy-oriented learning. The game-based intervention proved an effective and promising method for national/international experimentation and exchange among professional MSP planners. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, participants in group 2 was received the daily target setting during morning weighing and the difference between the measured weight and the target weight during bedtime weighing.Results: Average weight reduction in group 1 was significantly lower than that in group 2 (1.0 +/- 1.4 kg vs. 2.7 +/- 2.1 kg, p < 0.05). The proportion of participants who Lost >= 5% of their pre-program weight in group 2 was significantly higher than that in group 1 (28.6% vs. 3.6%, p <0.05).Conclusion: A self-weighing twice per day plus daily target setting and feedback is more effective in promoting weight loss than once-daily self-measurement.

"Stage-specific gene expression during spermatogenesis in the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis), a fish with semi-cystic type of spermatogenesis, as assessed by laser capture microdissection and absolute quantitative PCR","Marin-Juez, R; Vinas, J; Mechaly, AS; Planas, JV; Piferrer, F","Spermatogenesis is a complex process where hormonal signals regulate the interaction of different cell types in a tight spatial and temporal fashion. The Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) is a marine flatfish that, in contrast to many fish, exhibits a semi-cystic, asynchronous pattern of spermatogenesis progression. This pattern is characterized by the release of spermatids into the tubule lumen, where they transform into spermatozoa. In this study, we used laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate cells from cysts containing spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids or spermatozoa in order to investigate developmental patterns of gene expression. Furthermore, we also analyzed the stage-specific expression of the same set of genes throughout spermatogenesis (early-mid, late and maturing spermatogenic stages) in tissue fragments of the Senegalese sole testis. Genes analyzed by absolute qPCR in cysts isolated by LCM and stage-specific testis samples included genes involved in steroid synthesis and action (3 3 beta-hsd, 17 beta-hsd, 20 beta-hsd, star, star-like, progesterone receptor), gonadotropin action (fshr, Ihr), the kisspeptin system (kiss2, kiss2r) and other genes important for the production of mature gametes (zona pellucida 2.2, claudin and clusterin). Our results show that, in general, steroidogenesis-related genes tended to increase with spermatogenesis progression and that 3 beta-hsd and 20 beta-hsd were expressed in germ cells but 17 beta-hsd was not. Our results also show that fshr is expressed in most testicular cell types, including germ cells. In contrast, Ihr is expressed only in late spermatogenesis and is not expressed in any of the germ cell types examined, indicating that, in contrast to fshr, Ihr may be primarily expressed in non-germinal cells (e.g. Leydig cells). Furthermore, kisspeptin and its receptor were expressed in all germ cell types examined and, as expected, gamete maturation-related genes were more expressed in mature stages. These results illustrate that key factors that participate in the hormonal regulation of spermatogenesis in the Senegalese sole testis show complex cell type- and stage-specific patterns of gene expression.

This was rare in pre-western Inuit who lived on a diet that consisted mainly of marine mammals rich in n-3 fatty acids.Objectives: To assess the association between biomarkers of inflammation and the intake of traditional Inuit diet in addition to Inuit ethnicity.Methods: YKL-40 and hsCRP were measured in serum from 535 Inuit and non-Inuit living in the capital city Nuuk in West Greenland or in the main town or a settlement in rural East Greenland. Dietary habits were assessed by an interview-based food frequency questionnaire.Results: The participation rate was 95%. YKL-40 was higher in Inuit than in non-Inuit (p < 0.001), in Inuit with a higher intake of traditional Inuit diet (p < 0.001), and in Inuit from rural compared to urban areas (p < 0.001). It also rose with age (p < 0.001), alcohol intake (0.019) and smoking (p < 0.001). Inuit had higher hsCRP compared to non-Inuit (p = 0.003) and hsCRP increased in parallel with intake of traditional Inuit foods (p < 0.001). Alcohol associated with a decrease in hsCRP in Inuit (p = 0.004). YKL-40 and hsCRP increased with higher intakes of traditional Inuit diet after adjusting for ethnicity, gender, age, smoking, alcohol intake and BMI.Conclusions: Biomarkers of inflammation vary in parallel with the intake of traditional Inuit diet. A diet based on marine mammals from the Arctic does not reduce inflammatory activity and it may be speculated that markers of inflammation reflect the disease rather than the cause of the disease.

Effective practice in marine spatial planning: A participatory evaluation of experience in Southern England,"Fletcher, S; McKinley, E; Buchan, KC; Smith, N; McHugh, K","Marine spatial planning (MSP) is a new component of the marine governance framework in England. Two MSP pilot studies undertaken on the south of England are evaluated in this paper to obtain key reflections from participants and process organisers. The evaluation was conducted through two phases of personal interviews. Three key reflections emerged related to effective practice in MSP. First was that MSP should be inclusive, which is delivered through adequate participatory opportunities, clear leadership, exploiting trusted pre-existing communication channels, and supporting participants to develop their marine planning capacity. Second, was that the MSP evidence base should maximise the quality and extent of evidence available and offer clarity over data gaps and uncertainty. Third, that adequate resources are critical to successful MSP, particularly to ensure that stakeholder groups should allocate sufficient staff time to fully engage in MSP and that MSP process organisers should allocate sufficient resources to fully support stakeholders throughout the MSP process.

Stability of cooperative management of the Pacific sardine fishery under climate variability,"Ishimura, G; Herrick, S; Sumaila, UR","Asymmetry in transboundary fish stock distribution caused by climate variability can make the stability of cooperative management challenging. Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), which exhibits extreme decadal variability in abundance and geographic distribution corresponding to water temperature regime shifts within the California Current Ecosystem, is expected to face such issues. Pacific sardine is a transboundary resource targeted by Mexican, U.S. and Canadian fisheries. Our study applies a three-agent game theoretic model that incorporates environmental effects on Pacific sardine abundance and biomass distribution. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the stability of full and partial cooperative management of the Pacific sardine fishery, under seven different climate variability scenarios. Our results show that ocean climate variability could motivate the formation of stable cooperative management outcomes for the Pacific sardine fisheries operated by Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.

Historical antecedents and local governance in the process of public policies building for coastal zone of Brazil,"Marroni, EV; Asmus, ML","Brazil has a very big coastal zone of approximately 514.000 km(2) that embraces 397 municipalities in 17 coastal states. Its diversified area supports high variability of socio economics activities leading to serious conflicts in terms of coastal space and resources competition in an intensive human occupation context. This paper describes the past and present processes of coastal planning in Brazil and its mechanism towards the establishment of a costal management mode, capable to assure the desired sustainable development of the coast. It explains the policy trajectory of coastal Brazil and the way in which it is intended to be integrated into the national socio-political system. The National Policy for Sea Resources (PNRM) was a significant advance in organizing the multiple uses of the coastal and marine zones of Brazil. Established in the 1980s, the PNRM has been reviewed bi-annually through new proposed action plans. The Brazilian Costal Management Plan is analyzed trying to highlight the role of coastal municipalities in the planning and management processes. The role of local communities and municipalities in building public policies and management processes is still weak in Brazil and possibly can be enhanced with a better evaluation model and increasing local participation.

Scientists' prioritization of global coastal research questions,"Rudd, MA; Lawton, RN","Complex coastal management challenges often span ecological and political boundaries, and involve competing demands from groups advocating alternative coastal management strategies. As a consequence, policy-makers require scientific evidence from across a range of disciplines. Implementing cross-disciplinary research and facilitating science-policy engagement are, however, a significant challenge in its own right. Seven recent ecologically oriented 'big question' exercises identified a variety of research questions potentially important for coastal and marine management. In this research, 592 coastal scientists from 91 different countries completed a survey that ranked those 20 coastally oriented research questions. There was a clear overall ordering of aggregated coastal research priorities but scientists did exhibit heterogeneity regarding priorities. Some prioritized ecological issues while others focused more on issues such as coastal resource use or global environmental change. The differences in opinion were largely disciplinary-based, highlighting the importance of, and challenges in, encouraging scientific collaboration across disciplines to support effective coastal zone management. In addition to the ranking of existing questions, scientists submitted an additional 340 potential priority research questions, thus broadening the participatory nature of the original exercises. New questions regarding coastal processes, contaminants and pollution, and monitoring were prominent. This first synthesis across 'big question' exercises should provide valuable insights into the diversity of scientists' opinions and help policy makers understand potentially conflicting science advice.

Coping with uncertainties in science-based advice informing environmental management of the Baltic Sea,"Udovyk, O; Gilek, M","Managing uncertainty is a main challenge for sustainable management of complex socioecological systems, such as marine ecosystems. Today, a growing number of scientific publications address decision-making practices under conditions of high uncertainty. However, very few studies have analyzed how science treats uncertainty before it reaches decision-makers, especially for various marine environmental issues.This study aims to fill these research gaps by identifying the main theoretical approaches to science-based uncertainty management proposed in the scientific literature. Furthermore, by scrutinizing advisory documents, current approaches and methods to assess and treat uncertainty in science-based advice are analyzed and compared for five significant environmental issues in the Baltic Sea (eutrophication, fisheries, invasive species, chemical pollution, and oil spills). Specifically, the study analyzes the types of uncertainties acknowledged, how strategies and practices present and address uncertainties, and whether new theoretical proposals identified in the scientific literature affect existing practices.The study's results reveal that current scientific practices do not adequately address uncertainty in advice formulation. First, no common guideline is in use, resulting in significant differences among studied environmental issues and a common lack of structure, clarity, established terminology, and transparency in the assessment and treatment of uncertainty. Furthermore, new theoretical developments connected with uncertainty appraisal (such as theoretical typologies) and new tools and methods for handling uncertainty (such as precautionary and participatory approaches) are hardly utilized in practice in the management of the Baltic ecosystem. Consequently, although theoretical approaches for coping with uncertainty in complex socio-ecological systems are ample, the challenge for the future is to implement these approaches more effectively in assessment and management frameworks.The study discusses possible improvements to current practices in environmental management of large-scale socio-ecological systems such as the Baltic Sea and other regional seas, acknowledging that these measures will not reduce all existing uncertainty but rather contribute to a more comprehensive treatment of uncertainties.

Predicting success: Factors associated with weight change in obese youth undertaking a weight management program,"Baxter, KA; Ware, RS; Batch, JA; Truby, H","Objective: To explore which baseline physiological and psychosocial variables predict change in body mass index (BMI) z-score in obese youth after 12 weeks of a dietary weight management study.Methods: Participants were obese young people participating in a dietary intervention trial in Brisbane Australia. The outcome variable was change in BMI z-score. Potential predictors considered included demographic, physiological and psychosocial parameters of the young person, and demographic characteristics of their parents. A multivariable regression model was constructed to examine the effect of potential predictive variables.Results: Participants (n = 88) were predominantly female (69.3%), and had a mean(standard deviation) age of 13.1(1.9) years and BMI z-score of 2.2(0.4) on presentation. Lower BMI z-score (p < 0.001) and insulin resistance (p = 0.04) at baseline, referral from a paediatrician (p = 0.02) and being more socially advantaged (p = 0.046) were significantly associated with weight loss. Macronutrient distribution of diet and physical activity level did not contribute.Conclusions: Early intervention in obesity treatment in young people improves likelihood of success. Other factors such as degree of insulin resistance, social advantage and referral source also appear to play a role. Assessing presenting characteristics individualise a weight management program or determine the 'best-fit' treatment for an obese adolescent.

Metabolic syndrome components are associated with DNA hypomethylation,"Luttmer, R; Spijkerman, AM; Kok, RM; Jakobs, C; Blom, HJ; Serne, EH; Dekker, JM; Smulders, YM","Background: Disturbances of DNA methylation have been associated with multiple diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and, as some have suggested, glucometabolic disturbances. Our aim was to assess the association of the metabolic syndrome and its individual components with DNA methylation in a population-based study.Materials and methods: In a human population (n = 738) stratified by age, sex and glucose metabolism, we explored associations of the metabolic syndrome according to National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment Panel-III criteria and its individual components (fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, waist circumference) with global leukocyte DNA methylation. DNA methylation was measured as the methylcytosine/cytosine ratio in peripheral leukocytes using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.Results: Individuals with the metabolic syndrome had relative DNA hypomethylation compared to participants without the syndrome (beta = -0.05; p = 0.01). This association was mainly attributable to linear associations of two metabolic syndrome components with DNA methylation: fasting plasma glucose (beta = -0.02; p = 0.004) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = 0.07; p = 0.004). People with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism had DNA hypomethylation compared to normoglycemic individuals (beta = -0.05; p = 0.004)Conclusions: DNA hypomethylation is independently associated with hyperglycemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, both essential components of the metabolic syndrome. The potential implications and direction of possible causality require further study. (C) 2012 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

How well do the GCMs/RCMs capture the multi-scale temporal variability of precipitation in the Southwestern United States?,"Jiang, P; Gautam, MR; Zhu, JT; Yu, ZB","Multi-scale temporal variability of precipitation has an established relationship with floods and droughts. In this paper, we present the diagnostics on the ability of 16 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from Bias Corrected and Downscaled (BCSD) World Climate Research Program's (WCRP's) Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) projections and 10 Regional Climate Models (RCMs) that participated in the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) to represent multi-scale temporal variability determined from the observed station data. Four regions (Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Tucson, and Cimarron) in the Southwest United States are selected as they represent four different precipitation regions classified by clustering method. We investigate how storm properties and seasonal, inter-annual, and decadal precipitation variabilities differed between GCMs/RCMs and observed records in these regions. We find that current GCMs/RCMs tend to simulate longer storm duration and lower storm intensity compared to those from observed records. Most GCMs/RCMs fail to produce the high-intensity summer storms caused by local convective heat transport associated with the summer monsoon. Both inter-annual and decadal bands are present in the GCM/RCM-simulated precipitation time series; however, these do not line up to the patterns of large-scale ocean oscillations such as El Nino/La Nina Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decade! Oscillation (PDO). Our results show that the studied GCMs/RCMs can capture long-term monthly mean as the examined data is bias-corrected and downscaled, but fail to simulate the multi-scale precipitation variability including flood generating extreme events, which suggests their inadequacy for studies on floods and droughts that are strongly associated with multi-scale temporal precipitation variability.

"Eutrophication, risk management and sustainability. The perceptions of different stakeholders in the northern Baltic Sea","Lundberg, C","The environmental condition of the Baltic Sea is not only of concern for natural scientists. The awareness of the deteriorating state of the ecosystem has become an issue of interdisciplinary interest, and the amount of organizations with the marine environment and ecosystem health on the agenda is large. To present holistic and sustainable solutions and results of the actions taken, an active cooperation between all stakeholder groups and levels are needed. How different stakeholders in the northern Baltic Sea perceive the structures and assessments of the eutrophication were analyzed by semi-structured interviews with 17 stakeholders representing authorities, scientists, NGOs and national interest organizations. The focus was the view of the governance structures, risk assessment, management and communication. There was an overall consensus that eutrophication is a serious problem. Still variations in the opinions both within and between the stakeholder groups were seen. The scientists were most divergent from the rest. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequences of a cumulative perspective on marine environmental impacts: Offshore wind farming and seabirds at North Sea scale in context of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive,"Busch, M; Kannen, A; Garthe, S; Jessopp, M","Legal requirements in context of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive require increased transnational cooperation on environmental effects induced by marine uses to achieve Good Environmental Status by 2020. Interactions between offshore wind farms and seabirds represent a valuable example of how a changed spatial perspective might influence the assessment of environmental impacts. This paper addresses the potential consequences of offshore wind farm development at the North Sea scale on selected seabird species with high relevance in context of national approval procedures. It provides a new methodology to estimate the cumulative habitat loss due to ongoing and planned offshore wind farm construction activities within the North Sea's exclusive economic zones of Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom. In addition to providing information on the seasonal distribution of important species and initial estimates of potential seabird habitat exclusion due to offshore wind farming, this study highlights the need for increased trans-national cooperation among riparian states and harmonization of conservation approaches to successfully implement the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

"Justification for Creation of the ""Utrish"" Reserve","Ogureeva, G; Suslova, E; Leontyeva, O; Petrushina, M","The reserve ""Utrish"" has been created at the Black Sea coast of the Abrau Peninsula in 2010. It became the 102-nd in the list of protected areas of this type in Russia. Creation of the reserve is an important milestone in the struggle to preserve the unique landscapes of subtropical Mediterranean type, which occupy small areas in the country and abridge their range because of the growing human activity. Reserve creation was preceded by a long period of the researches, in which the authors of the paper took the active participation. A draft environmental-economic study for the establishment of the reserve ""Utrish"" to the exercise of which the World Wildlife Fund as part of the state contract attracted a group of researchers from Krasnodarskij Krai and Geography Faculty of Lomonosov Moscow State University.The idea of the urgent need for a protected area of the cluster type, including not only the terrestrial landscapes but adjacent marine areas has been formed during the realization of the project. From these positions the optimal variant of the reserve cluster position with the sub-Mediterranean landscapes and sea shelf ecosystems of the Black Sea was suggested.At the present stage the works on the functional zoning of the territory are conducted. Investigation of biodiversity, evaluable of state of different plant and animal groups and monitoring of ecosystems are necessary for organization of its preservation, for panning the activity for restoration of disturbed natural ecosystems.The study area became for Russia the only place where the Mediterranean vegetation is represented at the northern limit of its distribution. This is a unique enclave of the eastern Mediterranean, where the relic juniper and pistachio-juniper-oak forests and woodlands should be referred to the status of ""World Heritage"". The significance of the territory for the preservation and restoration of the ecological potential of sub-Mediterranean landscapes is very high. Relatively good preservation allows us to hope that the security service territory violated many community forests, woodlands and mountain steppe will undergo rehabilitation period and will be maintain the diversity of communities and habitats for the conservation of the unique biota of the sub-Mediterranean ecosystems.The uniqueness of the natural ecosystems of the North-Western Caucasus, saturation with endemic, relict and rare species, historical and cultural heritage of the area is invaluable in terms of maintaining the level of diversity and of value not only for Russia but for the World Community.",2013,,"GLOBAL CONGRESS ON ICM: LESSONS LEARNED TO ADDRESS NEW CHALLENGES, VOLS. 1 AND 2",,,309-318,WOS:000410345100030,,,#20291,Ogureeva 2013,,
ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE NATIONAL MARINE PARK OF ALONISOS IN NORTH SPORADES ISLANDS,"Ovezikoglou, P; Ladakis, M; Paraskevopoulou, V; Dassenakis, M","The National Marine Park of Alonisos in North Sporades was established in 1983. Its purpose was mainly to protect the threatened by extinction population of the Mediterranean monk seal Monachus monachus. In the present work we attempt to assess the effectiveness of the management of this marine park, which is active for almost 30 years. We tried to assess the pollution of the marine environment, as well as to record the public opinion about the operation of the Marine Park.A sampling cruise was carried out in the area during the summer of 2011. Water samples were collected from 18 sampling points around the area. In addition, appropriate questionnaires were distributed to the residents and tourists of the island of Alonnissos in order to investigate the public opinion. 78 residents and 86 tourists responded to the appeal to participate to our investigation.Very low values were determined for PO4 (0.00 0.08 mu mol/l) and NO2 (0.01 0.09 mu mol/l). The values of NO3 fluctuated between 0.00 and 4.35 mu mol/l and the ones of silicates between 0.03 and 0.40 mu mol/l. According to the eutrophication criteria used, the water of the marine park is characterized as oligothrophic to low mesotrophic. Low values were also determined for the dissolved heavy metals (the mean values for Cu, Mn, Cd and Pb were 0.32, 0.64, 0.04 and 0.15 mu g/l respectively) with the exception of Zn where quite elevated values were found (mean value 3.83 mu g/l). In conclusion, according to our determinations, the marine park is in a fair environmental condition from the chemical point of view.According to the questionnaires, the common resident's profile consists of a person about 40 years old which has received secondary education. The majority of the residents (64%) can be characterized as not very sensitive regarding the protection of marine environment, although they harbor an opposite opinion (up to 90%) about themselves. The residents' opinion about the contribution of the Marine Park to their life quality is divided as 33% believe that it is positive, 36% believe that it is negative and the rest 31% believe that it is neutral. On the other hand, a high percentage (80%) believes that the management of the Marine Park is inadequate. The common tourist's profile consists of a persons about 40 years old with university education and being well informed about the Marine Park, which is an attraction for him. The tourists of the area have the willingness to contribute to the protection of the Marine Park by abiding to the regulations and having good environmental behaviour. The majority of them are satisfied with the management of the Marine Park.

Cooperative path planning algorithm for marine surface vessels,"Tam, C; Bucknall, R","Effective and practical collision avoidance manoeuvres through traffic are still one of the major problems hindering the development and adoption of a fully autonomous vessel. There have been studies on the subject but the majority only consider the traffic from a single vessel perspective while the others utilised stochastic based algorithms which are not suitable for marine navigation which demands consistency. This paper describes the development of a deterministic path planning algorithm that computes a. practical and COLREGS compliant navigation path for vessels which are on a collision course. The algorithm was evaluated with a set of test cases, simulating various traffic scenarios. Different aspects of the algorithm, such as the output consistency from different perspectives, practicality of the navigation path, computational performance as well as future work, are discussed.

Association between methylmercury and cardiovascular risk factors in a native population of Quebec (Canada): A retrospective evaluation,"Valera, B; Dewailly, E; Poirier, P","Background: Epidemiological evidence suggests a negative impact of methylmercury (MeHg) on cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). This issue is of concern in Arctic populations such as in the Inuit of Nunavik since this contaminant is accumulated in fish and marine mammals, which still represent the subsistence diet of this population.Objective: We examined the associations between MeHg and BP and resting HR among Inuit adults.Methods: The ""Sante Quebec"" health survey was conducted in 1992 in the 14 villages of Nunavik and a complete set of data was obtained for 313 Inuit adults >= 18 years. Blood samples were collected in order to determine total mercury, lead, total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), n - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), fasting glucose and lipid profile while socio-demographic variables were obtained through questionnaires. Anthropometric measurements as well as BP and resting HR were obtained using standardised protocols. Pulse pressure (PP: systolic BP minus diastolic BP) was also calculated. Multiple linear regression was used in order to determine the change in the dependent variables associated with the quartiles of MeHg concentration, taking the quartile 1 as reference.Results: The mean age of the participants was 38 +/- 14 years and the sample was composed of 132 men (42.2%) and 181 women (57.8%). MeHg geometric mean was 15.4 mu g/L (95%CI: 13.9-17.0) and levels ranged from 0.8 to 112.0 mu g/L. Resting HR increased linearly across quartiles of blood MeHg concentration after adjusting for confounders (p for trend=0.02). An increase of 6.9 beats per minute (bpm) between the 4th and 1st quartile was observed after adjusting for confounders. No significant association was observed between blood MeHg and systolic BP, diastolic BP or PP.Conclusions: MeHg was associated with increasing resting HR after considering traditional risk factors as well as other contaminants (lead and total PCBs) and n - 3 PUFAs. In contrast, no significant association with blood pressure was observed in this study. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Among population differentiation at nuclear genes in native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Scotland,"Wachowiak, W; Iason, GR; Cavers, S","In the Scottish Highlands, Scots pine is at the north-western extreme of its wide natural distribution. Here, the remaining native populations are patchily distributed in highly variable environments, from the more continental, drier eastern Highlands to the milder, wetter Atlantic Ocean coast. As these pinewoods are the remnants of a naturally established forest, they form a valuable system for analysis of genetic and adaptive variation in heterogeneous environments. Using samples from across the Scottish population, we analysed data from nuclear and mitochondrial genes to assess patterns of within and between population genetic variation. Within population diversity levels were high, and significant genetic differentiation among pairs of Scottish populations at relatively small spatial scales was present at several nuclear loci. At these loci, no differentiation had been found among continental populations, even those separated by large geographic distances. Overall, no clear clustering of Scottish samples was found in population structure analysis suggesting that geographically distant populations with high intra-population nucleotide diversity are not strongly isolated or diverged from each other. Scottish populations lacked a mitotype that is widespread in eastern and north-eastern Europe, indicating that pines from that area may not have participated in the most recent colonisation of the British Isles.

Mission management and control of BSA-AUV for ocean survey,"Bian, XQ; Yan, ZP; Chen, T; Yu, DL; Zhao, YF","This paper presents the design, implementation and real world evaluation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The mission of the vehicle is to carry out an ocean survey in dynamic, partially unknown and unsafe environment, and subject to constraints on the operations. It is a multi-area and multi-sensor-type survey mission which is appropriate for a large range ocean survey to obtain different parameters in different objective areas. The main work in this project is the novel design and development of a hierarchical on-board architecture of the AUV. The architecture is specified by increasingly detailed Petri nets (PN) under the agent-based distributed autonomous control structure. A number of agents have been used in the architecture for mission management and control. Communications and cooperation between agents are realised. The management and control of the mission is modelled by discrete events driven PN formalism. The highest level PN and lower sub-PNs with designed events are described in detail. The designed vehicle has been tested in real world experiments, a lake trial, to evaluate its performance. The feasibility and effectiveness of the architecture is proven in the lake trials in nominal and degraded situations. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Validation of reported events from a vertical chute marine evacuation study,"Harwood, D; Farrow, A","Background: The use of vertical chute marine evacuation systems (MES) is now well established on board marine passenger vessels; this system has yet to be deployed in an emergency situation, however, it has been associated with a fatality and several major injuries during training. Brunel University's Ethics Committee endorsed an initial retrospective cross sectional study (Harwood and Farrow, 2008) and the present quantitative observational study. Harwood and Farrow (2008) found that the physical, physiological and psychological characteristics of potential evacuees increased the likelihood of injury and adversely affected the reliability of the system.Purpose: The validation of factors associated with the adverse outcomes recorded by Harwood and Farrow (2008) during vertical chute MES training, and to assess the hypothesis that evacuee's clothing material will affect the efficiency of the system.Design: Observational data in a marine training establishment providing a triangulation measurement process of evidence from the retrospective study (Harwood and Farrow, 2008). Subjects were three hundred and seventy five representative participants on training courses for evacuation from a ship into inflated life rafts. The main outcome measures were stopping during descent and exiting the chute in an undesirable position.Results: 6.1% stopped momentarily during descent; 20.3% exited the chute in an undesirable position; on entering the raft 7.7% flipped over and 9.1% had their legs tucked up under their bodies. Independent variables including evacuees' clothing material were statistically significantly associated with adverse outcomes. Participants stopping during descent had an RR of 3.03 (95% CI 1.38, 6.64) for exiting the chute in an undesirable position.Conclusions: This quantitative observational study broadly supported the results obtained from the retrospective cross sectional study (Harwood and Farrow, 2008). Stopping during descent and evacuee clothing increased the likelihood of undesirable outcomes and impacted on the efficiency of the system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Implementing integrated coastal management in a sector-based governance system,"Taljaard, S; Slinger, JH; Morant, PD; Theron, AK; van Niekerk, L; van der Merwe, J","Over the last four decades the development of frameworks for integrated coastal management (ICM) and models for ICM implementation have received much attention from researchers and practitioners alike. This has resulted in a proliferation of implementation models, many of which embody results-based approaches, with the primary focus being on identifying coastal issues and then addressing these by implementing specific projects or programmes. Despite explicitly recognising the importance of cooperative governance early on. ICM implementation still faces the challenge that governance systems remain largely sector-based. In this paper we explore the implementation of ICM within a sector-based governance system in South Africa. First, we draw on international best practice and situated knowledge to develop a prototype ICM implementation model designed to accommodate sector-based programmes within an overarching ecosystem-based approach. Next, we assess the usability of the prototype and the compatibility with a sector-based governance system using empirical information derived from South Africa's National Programme of Action to protect the marine environment from land-based activities. We conclude that integrated management of the coast is possible in a sector-based governance system and propose the ICM implementation model developed in this paper as a potentially suitable model for countries with similar coastal management milieus to South Africa.

Predictors of short-term work-related disability among active duty US Navy personnel: a cohort study in patients with acute and subacute low back pain,"Hiebert, R; Campello, MA; Weiser, S; Ziemke, GW; Fox, BA; Nordin, M","BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Musculoskeletal disorders of the spine in the US military account for the single largest proportion of the absence of sickness causes leading to early termination. We explored if selected psychological and physical factors were associated with poor outcome after episodes of low back pain (LBP).PURPOSE: To identify clinical, demographic, and psychological factors predictive of work duty status after a complaint of LBP.STUDY DESIGN: A prospective clinical cohort of US Navy personnel treated for LBP.PATIENT SAMPLE: Eligible cases were active duty US Navy or Marine Corps personnel presenting to an emergency clinic or primary care clinic with a complaint of LBP, where the index episode of LBP was no more than 12 weeks duration before enrollment.OUTCOME MEASURES: The subject's work status (full duty, light duty, sick in quarters [SIQ], limited duty, or medically released to full duty) was abstracted from the subject's electronic medical record at approximately 4 weeks and then again 12 weeks after study enrollment. Work status in this study population is assigned by a Navy health-care provider at the time of a clinical visit and based on the health-care provider's determination of medical fitness for duty. This study collapsed work status into two groups, ""full duty"" (consisting of ""full duty"" and ""medically released to full duty"") and ""not at full duty"" (consisting of ""light duty,"" ""SIQ,"" and ""limited duty"").METHODS: Volunteers completed a baseline questionnaire consisting of recommended well-validated measures, including attitudes and beliefs about LBP and work (Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire [FABQ] and the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia), distress (the Pain Catastrophizing Scale), clinical depression (The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), a numeric pain intensity scale, self-perceived disability (Oswestry Disability Index), and general health status (12-Item Short Form Health Survey). Navy health-care providers conducted a back pain-specific medical evaluation. Associations are expressed as multivariate-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) estimated using Poisson regression.RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-three participants were enrolled. Work status outcome was collected for 239 participants. Predictors of ""not at full duty"" at 4 weeks after enrollment included having back pain for 4 weeks or less before study enrollment (PR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.21-5.97) and increased FABQ Work subscale score (PR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08). The sole predictor of work status at 12 weeks after enrollment was increased FABQ Physical Activity (FABQ Physical) subscale score (PR=1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.30).CONCLUSIONS: The findings that fear-avoidance beliefs were predictive of subsequent work status among active duty service personnel in this study population (after adjusting for clinical, demographic, and psychological covariates) suggest the clinical utility of addressing these factors during treatment of back pain episodes in the military. These findings reflect the important role that psychological factors may play in the return to work process in an active duty military population. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Determinants of Visitor Pro-Environmental Intentions on Two Small Greek Islands: Is Ecotourism Possible at Coastal Protected Areas?,"Kafyri, A; Hovardas, T; Poirazidis, K","A relatively under-researched question is whether there is a possibility of influencing environmentally aware tourists regarding ecotourism at destinations that continue to develop under a pattern of mass 'seaside' tourism. Our objective was to assess the pro-environmental intentions of visitors at two small Greek islands, which are within a Natura 2000 site, specifically Paxoi and Antipaxoi. Intentions involved willingness to receive information about the protected area, willingness to accept pro-environmental limitations on recreational experience, and willingness-to-pay a conditional environmental conservation value added tax. In addition, we aimed to identify determinants of visitor pro-environmental intentions among visitor and visit characteristics, visitor satisfaction, and self-reported environmental knowledge, as well as anticipated outcomes of tourism development and suggestions for protected area management. We randomly collected 324 usable questionnaires during the summer season; 242 (74.69 %) by Greek visitors and 82 (25.31 %) by foreign visitors. Visitor satisfaction was quite high; however, visitors reported low levels of environmental knowledge. Our findings showed that the unique characteristics of the destination were not salient among visitors and that there is a lack of effective outreach campaigns, interpretation, and on-site environmental education programs. However, our study revealed high levels of visitor pro-environmental intentions that might support the promotion of ecotourism on the two islands. We provide recommendations based on determinants of visitor pro-environmental intentions, which might assist towards advancing visitor participation in environmental education projects, environmentally responsible behavior among visitors, and financial contribution to environmental conservation by visitors.",2012,,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,50,1,64-76,WOS:000304623500007,10.1007/s00267-012-9856-z,,#20300,Kafyri 2012,,
Insertion-deletions in a FADS2 intron 1 conserved regulatory locus control expression of fatty acid desaturases 1 and 2 and modulate response to simvastatin,"Reardon, HT; Zhang, J; Kothapalli, KSD; Kim, AJ; Park, WJ; Brenna, JT","The fatty acid desaturase genes (FADS1 and FADS2) code for enzymes required for synthesis of omega-3 and omega-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) important in the central nervous system, inflammatory response, and cardiovascular health. SNPs in these genes are associated with numerous health outcomes, but it is unclear how genetic variation affects enzyme function. Here, lymphoblasts obtained from Japanese participants in the International HapMap Project were evaluated for association of expression microarray results with SNPs in the FADS gene cluster. Six SNPs in the first intron of the FADS2 gene were associated with FADS1 expression. A 10-SNP haplotype in FADS2 (rs2727270 to rs2851682) present in 24% of the population was associated with lower expression of FADS1. A highly conserved region coinciding with the most significant SNPs contained predicted binding sites for SREBP and PPAR gamma. Lymphoblasts homozygous for either the major or minor haplotype were treated with agonists for these transcription factors and expression of FADS] and FADS2 determined. Simvastatin and the LXR agonist GW3965 both upregulated expression of FADS1 and FADS2: no response was found for PPAR gamma agonist rosiglitazone. The minor haplotype homozygotes had 20-40% higher induction of FADS1 and FADS2 after simvastatin or GW3965 treatment. A 22 bp polymorphic insertion-deletion (INDEL) was found 137 bp downstream from the putative sterol response element, as well as a 3 or 1 bp INDEL 81-83 bp downstream. All carriers of the minor haplotype had deletions while all carriers of the major haplotype had insertions. Individuals carrying the minor haplotype may be vulnerable to alterations in diet that reduce LCPUFA intake, and especially responsive to statin or marine oil therapy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Prevalence and correlates of antipsychotic polypharmacy: A systematic review and meta-regression of global and regional trends from the 1970s to 2009,"Gallego, JA; Bonetti, J; Zhang, JP; Kane, JM; Correll, CU","Objective: To assess the prevalence and correlates of antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP) across decades and regions.Methods: Electronic PubMed/Google Scholar search for studies reporting on APP, published from 1970 to 05/2009. Median rates and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated and compared using non-parametric tests. Demographic and clinical variables were tested as correlates of APP in bivariate and meta-regression analyses.Results: Across 147 studies (1,418,163 participants, 82.9% diagnosed with schizophrenia [IQR=42-100%]), the median APP rate was 19.6% (IQR=12.9-35.0%). Most common combinations included first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) + second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) (42.4%, IQR=0.0-71.4%) followed by FGAs + FGAs (19.6%, IQR=0.0-100%) and SGAs + SGAs (1.8%, IQR=0.0-28%). APP rates were not different between decades (1970-1979:28.8%, IQR=7.5-44%; 1980-1989:17.6%, IQR=10.8-38.2; 1990-1999:22.0%, IQR=11-40; 2000-2009:19.2% IQR=14.4-29.9, p=0.78), but between regions, being higher in Asia and Europe than North America, and in Asia than Oceania (p<0.001). APP increased numerically by 34% in North America from the 1980s 12.7%) to 2000s (17.0%) (p=0.94) and decreased significantly by 65% from 1980 (55.5%) to 2000 (19.2%) in Asia (p=0.03), with non-significant changes in Europe. APP was associated with inpatient status (p<0.001), use of FGAs (p<0.0001) and anticholinergics (<0.001), schizophrenia (p=0.01), less antidepressant use (p=0.02), greater LAIs use (p=0.04), shorter follow-up (p=0.001) and cross-sectional vs. longitudinal study design (p=0.03). In a meta-regression, inpatient status (p<0.0001), FGA use (0.046), and schizophrenia diagnosis (p=0.004) independently predicted APP (N=66, R-2=0.44, p<0.0001).Conclusions: APP is common with different rates and time trends by region over the last four decades. APP is associated with greater anticholinergic requirement, shorter observation time, greater illness severity and lower antidepressant use. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Dietary fatty acids and peripheral artery disease in adults,"Naqvi, AZ; Davis, RB; Mukamal, KJ","Background: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a debilitating condition involving atherosclerosis. Although saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids have strong associations with atherosclerosis, it is unclear if diets high in these fatty acids affect PAD.Methods: We studied 6352 adults aged 40 years and older who participated in the U. S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1999 and 2004. Ankle brachial index (ABI) was assessed by standardized blood pressure measurements, and we defined PAD as an ABI<0.9. Fatty acid intake was assessed by validated 24-h dietary recall. We used multivariable linear and logistic regression to estimate associations between intakes of dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MFAs), marine omega-3 fatty acids (N-3), linolenic acid (LNA), and omega-6 fatty acids (N-6) and ABI/PAD.Results: The prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) of PAD was 5.2% (95% CI 4.6-5.8).There were no associations between ABI and intakes of marine N-3 (p = 0.83) or N-6 (p = 0.19) in adjusted models. In contrast, LNA was associated with higher ABI (p = 0.04) and SFA tended to be associated with lower ABI (p = 0.06) in adjusted models. In addition, higher SFA was associated with a higher prevalence of PAD: adjusted odds ratio 1.30 (95% CI 1.01-1.67; p = 0.04) and a trend toward slower gait speed (p = 0.08).Conclusion: In this nationally representative sample, higher dietary intakes of LNA and SFAs were associated with higher and lower ABI, respectively. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the potential protective effects of dietary LNA and detrimental effects of dietary SFAs on PAD. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The art of red tide science,"Hall, ER; Nierenberg, K; Boyes, AJ; Heil, CA; Flewelling, LJ; Kirkpatrick, B","Over the years, numerous outreach strategies by the science community, such as FAQ cards and website information, have been used to explain blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis that occur annually off the west coast of Florida to the impacted communities. Many state and federal agencies have turned to funded research groups for assistance in the development and testing of environmental outreach products. In the case of Florida red tide, the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute/Mote Marine Laboratory (MML) Cooperative Red Tide Agreement allowed MML to initiate a project aimed at developing innovative outreach products about Florida red tide. This project, which we coined ""The Art of Red Tide Science,"" consisted of a team effort between scientists from MML and students from Ringling College of Art and Design.

Reflective practice for marine planning: A case study of marine nature-based tourism partnerships,"Kelly, C; Essex, S; Glegg, G","An essential component of ecosystem-based approaches in coastal zone management and the emerging field of marine planning are partnerships and collaborations between a range of multi-sector organisations and individuals. Ensuring that partnerships are effective is a priority for those responsible for planning and management in coastal and marine environments. Current partnership evaluation approaches, however, tend to view effectiveness as the cumulative end result of a set of variables acting in a linear process at a specific point in time. Given that governance and participation are acknowledged as non-linear and multifaceted processes, more reflective and nuanced approaches that take account of the dynamic, multidimensional and geographically embedded nature of the collaborative process are needed. This paper proposes a new framework for partnership evaluation based on policy narratives and indicators, and demonstrates the potential of the approach using three case studies of partnerships focused upon marine nature-based tourism. The insights from this research have direct relevance to the agencies and organisations responsible for delivering integrated coastal management, including marine spatial planning.

Optical performance of PHEBUS/EUV detector onboard BepiColombo,"Yoshioka, K; Murakami, G; Yoshikawa, I; Maria, JL; Mariscal, JF; Rouanet, N; Mine, PO; Quemerais, E","BepiColombo, a mission of ESA (European Space Agency) in cooperation with JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), will explore Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun. BepiColombo will launch in 2014 on a journey lasting up to six and a half years; the data gathering phase should occupy a one year nominal mission, with a possible extension of another year. The data which will be brought back from the orbiters will tell us about the Hermean surface, atmospheric composition, and magnetospheric dynamics; it will also contribute to understanding the history and formation of terrestrial planets. The PHEBUS (Probing of Hermean Exosphere by Ultraviolet Spectroscopy) instrument will be flown on MPO: Mercury Planetary Orbiter, one of the two BepiColombo orbiters. The main purpose of the instrument is to reveal the composition and the distribution of the exosphere of Mercury through EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet: 55-155 nm) and FUV (Far Ultraviolet: 145-315 nm) measurements. A consortium composed of four main countries has been formed to build it. Japan provides the two detectors (EUV and FUV), Russia implements the scanning system, and France and Italy take charge of the overall design, assembly, test, integration, and also provide two small NUV (Near Ultraviolet) detectors (for the light from calcium and potassium molecules). An optical prototype of the EUV detector which is identical to the flight configuration has been manufactured and evaluated. In this paper, we show the first spectra results observed by the EUV channel optical prototype. We also describe the design of PHEBUS and discuss the possibility of detecting noble gases in Mercury's exosphere taking the experimental results so far into account. (C) 2012 COSPAR.

"Assessing compliance with fish survival standards: a case study at Rock Island Dam, Washington","Skalski, JR; Steig, TW; Hemstrom, SL","Safe fish passage through hydroprojects is of paramount importance in the Pacific Northwest of the United States where anadromous runs of salmon smolts pass through as many as nine dams on the Columbia River on their way to the ocean. Minimum survival standards through the dams or hydroprojects (i.e., reservoir and dam) have been established by the 2008 Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) Biological Opinion or by Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) in order to protect salmon stocks. These federal requirements have prompted the need to conduct scientifically and statistically rigorous and precise smolt survival studies at federally and publicly operated hydroprojects throughout the Snake-Columbia River Basin. Successful studies have been the cooperative results of regulators, hydro managers, fish biologists, engineers, and biometricians working together to conduct these high value investigations. Rock Island Dam, Washington, is used as a case study where a total of 17 release-recapture studies were conducted over a nine-year period on three salmonid species to assess compliance with HCP survival standards.

Managing institutional overlap in the protection of marine ecosystems on the high seas. The case of the North East Atlantic,"Kvalvik, I","The existence of regional and global institutions with the mandate to regulate different human activities that impact on the marine ecosystems on the high seas has created a need for inter institutional coordination. The article examines the overlap and interaction between two regional institutions addressing the issue in the North East Atlantic high seas, namely the Commission for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (the OSPAR Commission) and the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). The question raised is whether the overlaps between NEAFC and the OSPAR Commission represent a management problem. Applying insights from regime theory on institutional interplay, the study argues that the overlap in objective, but not in the activities that can be regulated, combined with structural overlaps, can give both supportive and obstructive policies. The study finds that when moving from the agenda setting to the implementation and assessment phases the cooperation has increased. We therefore see a development from a rather reluctant coexistence to a formal and more operative, and synergic, interaction. The study concludes that successful management of the high seas ecosystems requires horizontal interaction at both the international and national level, and that the interaction between NEAFC and the OSPAR Commission are used as a basis for integrating other institutions relevant for protecting vulnerable marine ecosystems in areas beyond national jurisdiction in the North East Atlantic.

Evolution of the martian mantle inferred from the Re-187-Os-187 isotope and highly siderophile element abundance systematics of shergottite meteorites,"Brandon, AD; Puchtel, IS; Walker, RJ; Day, JMD; Irving, AJ; Taylor, LA","Shergottite meteorites are a suite of mafic to ultramafic igneous rocks whose parental magmas probably derived from the martian mantle. In this study, a suite of 23 shergottites, spanning their known range in bulk compositions, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, and Lu-Hf isotopes, were measured for Re-187-Os-187 isotopic systematics and highly siderophile element abundances (HSE: including Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, Pd, Re). The chief objective was to gain new insight on the chemical evolution of the martian mantle by unraveling the long-term HSE budget of its derivative melts. Possible effects upon HSEs related to crustal contamination, as well as terrestrial and/or martian surface alteration are also examined.Some of the shergottites are hot arid-desert finds. Their respective acetic acid leachates and residues show that both Re and Os display open-system behavior during sample residence at or near the martian and/or terrestrial surfaces. In some meteorites, the alteration effects can be circumvented by analysis of the leached residues. For those shergottites believed to record robust Re-Os isotopic systematics, calculated initial Os-187/Os-188 are well correlated with the initial Nd-143/Nd-144. Shergottites from mantle sources with long-term melt-depleted characteristics (initial epsilon Nd-143 of + 36 to + 40) have chondritic initial gamma Os-187 ranging from -0.5 to + 2.5. Shergottites with intermediate initial epsilon Nd-143 of + 8 to + 17 have a range in initial gamma Os-187 of -0.6 to + 2.3, which overlaps the range for depleted shergottites. Shergottites from long-term enriched sources, with initial epsilon Nd-143 of similar to-7, are characterized by suprachondritic gamma Os-187 values of + 5 to + 15. The initial gamma Os-187 variations for the shergottites do not show a correlation with indices of magmatic differentiation, such as MgO, or any systematic differences between hot arid-desert finds, Antarctic finds, or observed falls.The strong correlation between the initial epsilon Nd-143 and gamma Os-187 in shergottites from approximately + 40 and 0 to -7 and + 15, respectively, is assessed in models for mixing depleted mantle-derived melts with ancient crust (modeled to be similar to evolved shergottite in composition), and with assimilation-fractional crystallization. These models show that the correlation is unlikely to result from participation of martian crust. More likely, this correlation relates to contributions from depleted and enriched reservoirs formed in a martian magma ocean at ca. 4.5 Ga. These models indicate that the shergottite endmember sources were generated by mixing between residual melts and cumulates that formed at variable stages during solidification of a magma ocean.The expanded database for the HSE abundances in shergottites suggests that their martian mantle sources have similar HSE abundances to the terrestrial mantle, consistent with prior studies. The relatively high HSE abundances in both planetary mantles likely cannot be accounted for by high pressure-temperature metal-silicate partitioning at the bases of magma oceans, as has been suggested for Earth. If the HSE were instead supplied by late accretion, this event must have occurred prior to the crystallization of the last martian magma ocean. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Constructed preference stability: a test-retest,"Brouwer, R","Preference construction has been argued to undermine the use of stated preference results like willingness to pay (WTP) values in policy evaluations. Preferences constructed at the time of the valuation task are expected to be unstable and hence unreliable. Choice repetition and experience have been shown to stabilize preferences and increase choice consistency. The objective of this article is twofold. First, to examine the effect of self-reported construction bias on stated preferences during a repeated choice contingent valuation (CV) study. Second, to test the effect of choice repetition on the stability of the articulated preferences in a test-retest experiment using a single and double bound CV referendum elicitation format. As expected, unfamiliarity with the environmental good in question results in a significant impact of the survey instrument on preference construction. This in turn influences the respondent decision to participate in the contingent market, but after controlling for self-selection, cognitive and motivational characteristics, not the size of the WTP value. Evidence is found that choice experience filters out possible construction bias.

Enabling people to create change: Capacity building for Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF) implementation in Southern Africa,"Okes, NC; Petersen, S; McDaid, L; Basson, J","Recent studies report that 80% of marine resources are fully or over exploited. In an attempt to address this, countries are moving towards implementing an Ecosystems Approach (EAF) to Fisheries management. A strong component of an EAF is the involvement of fishing sector stakeholders in the making of decisions that affect them but, despite this, no formal or informal information exchange or training on this and other EAF concepts existed in South Africa prior to the development of the Responsible Fisheries Programme (RFP). The RFP training course design integrates theoretical presentations and practical exercises, deliberately involving various stakeholders with differing perspectives and roles. The RFP has trained a total of 600 individuals thus far (May 2007-January 2010) from various fisheries sectors in southern Africa. Sampling evaluation forms processed across all fisheries sectors trained, indicated that participants found the practical exercises very useful and valued the group work, which allowed for interactions between the different stakeholder groups. Numerous positive benefits derived from the training are described by means of case studies. Lessons drawn from the roll out of the training include: the forging of a common understanding through stakeholder participation; the benefits of a participatory approach and the appropriate use of local and international case studies to illustrate concepts. Results of the training carried out to date indicate that the RFP training can improve compliance of fisheries regulations, adherence to voluntary measures and uplift the skills of fishers. Such benefits will increase the likelihood of long-term sustainability of southern African fisheries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of a bycatch reduction technology by fishermen: A case study from Sicily,"Piovano, S; Basciano, G; Swimmer, Y; Giacoma, C","Bycatch reduction technologies (BRTs) have been developed to limit the incidental capture of nontarget marine species in fishing gear, especially those species of special concern. However, in the absence of enforcement, the proven effectiveness of a BRT alone does not guarantee its adoption by fishermen. Human factors also play a fundamental role. This case study was directed at evaluating the willingness of Sicilian longline fishermen to use relatively large circle hooks (size 16/0) as a BRT for the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta. Fishermen were involved in testing circle hooks with their fishing vessels and their own commercial fishing gear, and their opinions before and after trials at sea were recorded. The present study showed the importance of creating a positive human context for testing a BRT. Findings provided additional confirmation about the usefulness of relatively large circle hooks to reduce the bycatch of loggerhead sea turtles on drifting longlines. Interviews before and after trials at sea indicated that socio-economic and emotional factors are essential for successful uptake of BRTs. Crews of large fishing vessels stated that they would be willing to use circle hooks in months with a high probability of turtle captures (June-September) if an economic incentive was provided and there was also public acknowledgement of their efforts. The fishermen's cooperatives association involved in the project is currently evaluating the creation of a product label identifying the harbors where fishing was performed using circle hooks.

"Acceptance and commitment therapy for bariatric surgery patients, a pilot RCT","Weineland, S; Arvidsson, D; Kakoulidis, TP; Dahl, J","Bariatric surgery (BS) is rated as the best evidence based treatment for obesity with regard to weight loss and maintenance of weight loss evaluated to date. Although BS interventions are effective, 20-30% of BS patients start to regain weight within 24 months. Emotional eating is a behavior pattern which has been found to predict poor outcome. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for patients who underwent BS, with regard to emotional eating, body dissatisfaction and quality of life. This study is a randomized controlled trial (n = 39) with two conditions (1) ACT including two face-to-face sessions and support via an Internet application and (2) treatment as usual (TAU) comprising the standard follow-up used by the BS team. Results show that participants in the ACT condition significantly improve on eating disordered behaviors, body dissatisfaction, quality of life and acceptance for weight related thoughts and feelings, as compared to those in the TAU group. This study shows that it is possible to improve effects of BS by specifically targeting emotional eating behavior. (C) 2011 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.

Metalliferous sediments in the Atlantis II Deep-Assessing the geological and economic resource potential and legal constraints,"Bertram, C; Kratschell, A; O'Brien, K; Bruckmann, W; Proelss, A; Rehdanz, K","Projected increases in demand and thus increasing metal prices have brought the exploration and exploitation of marine mineral resources back into focus. The Atlantis II Deep, located in the central Red Sea between Saudi Arabia and Sudan, is one of the largest marine sulfide deposits known, with high concentrations of metals such as zinc, copper, silver and gold. However, little is known about the economic potential of marine minerals as well as the legal constraints. Our geological assessment shows that the deep is similar in grades and scale to large land-based deposits. Its economic potential is far from negligible. The total present value of possible gross revenues for the four metals zinc, copper, silver and gold ranges from 3.03 to 5.29 billion US$, depending on the assumptions made concerning future price development, mass calculation and discount rate. From a legal perspective, a general duty to cooperate in the exploration and exploitation of non-living resources located in disputed maritime areas is identified in both customary international law and in UNCLOS. It is submitted that a joint development agreement is one means of ensuring compliance with this duty in general and in the case of the Atlantis II Deep in particular. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Progress in Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) in Northern Ireland,"Cooper, JAG","The history of development of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) in Northern Ireland is described here in the context of European and UK initiatives. The current structures for ICZM in Northern Ireland involve a formal strategy. This involves a number of specific actions in the environmental, social, and economic spheres with specific goals pertaining to integration. The strategy has been agreed by all responsible organisations (both governmental and NGOs), and each action is time-bound and has an identified responsible agency. The Northern Ireland Coastal and Marine Forum (NICMF) which consists of non-governmental members, has the task of monitoring the implementation of the strategy and acting as a catalyst for integration. The strengths of the current structure lie in the presence of an integrating ICZM strategy and the fact that the initiative is government-led in response to the EU Recommendation on ICZM. These provide better levels of sustainability and links to the statutory system of governance compared to the partnership model in Great Britain. Its main weaknesses are: (i) that the NICMF relies on voluntary participation; (ii) linkages between government departments have not been substantially improved; and (iii) weak mechanisms for ensuring goals are achieved.

Infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies of hybrid organic/inorganic fast sol-gel glasses,"Pokrass, M; Gouzman, I; Bar, G; Gvishi, R","Fast Sol-Gel (FSG) hybrid materials with varying organic residues were analyzed by Mid- and Near-Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, allowing identification of functional groups of the matrix composition. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the atomic composition of the hybrids, showing good correlation to values calculated according to the starting precursors. Mid-IR spectral analysis of the glasses enables insight into polymerization and curing processes. It can thus be used to assess optical and mechanical performance of a variety of sal-gel based devices. Analysis of the broad band at 1920 nm allows the identification of three different water species: S(0), S(1) and S(2) together with clustered water. The subscript numerical label applies to the number of hydrogens participating in bonding with the surface silanols. We suggest that the surface silanols exhibit different sites, each susceptible to a characteristic adsorption mode of a water molecule.In this work we show that the FSG hybrid material is very stable at elevated humidity environments, and is even resistant to water immersion. These properties could be beneficial for optical and mechanical applications for marine targeted devices or medical sensors operating in aqueous media. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Who participates in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and why: A quantitative assessment of the national representation of authors in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,"Ho-Lem, C; Zerriffi, H; Kandlikar, M","This paper presents a quantitative analysis of international representation in the activities of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change using expert authorship counts by country in each of the four IPCC assessment reports (1990, 1995, 2001 and 2007). Overall, we find that 45% of countries, all Non-Annex 1, have never had authors participate in the IPCC process: on the other hand, European and North American experts are make up more than 75% of all authors (N = 4394). Generalized linear models using negative binomial regression were used to quantitatively estimate the effect of a number of socioeconomic, environmental and procedural factors influencing country-level participation in the IPCC. Per capita gross domestic product, population, English-speaking status, and levels of tertiary education were all found to be statistically significant drivers of authorship counts. In particular, participation by authors from English-speaking Non-Annex 1 countries is 2.5 times greater than those that are non-English speaking. Regionally small island nations of Oceania were the most severely under-represented group. South American and Asian countries had fewer authors, and African countries had more authors than what might be expected on the basis of demographic and socio-economic data. These differences across nations partly reflect existing scientific capacity that will be slow to change. However, the on-going under-representation of developing country scientists in the IPCC, particularly in the assessment of climate science (WGI) and climate mitigation (WGIII) warrants greater efforts to close the capacity gap.

Telmisartan effectively improves insulin sensitivity in hypertensive patients with insulin resistance,"Shinohara, T; Takahashi, N; Abe, I; Okada, N; Wakisaka, O; Yufu, K; Hara, M; Nakagawa, M; Saikawa, T; Yoshimatsu, H","Objective: The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) telmisartan has been shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and increase adiponectin protein content in adipocytes. We tested the hypothesis that telmisartan can increase the serum level of adiponectin and improve insulin resistance.Methods: The study participants were 25 consecutive hypertensive patients (8 females, 17 males; 65 +/- 10 years). Insulin resistance was defined as a patient showing >= 2.5 in the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index. We divided subjects into non-insulin resistance (n = 10) and insulin resistance groups (n = 15) based on the HOMA index. Telmisartan was administered (40 mg/day) was administered for 24 weeks.Results: In the insulin resistance group, telmisartan treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the HOMA index and serum level of C-reactive protein, and it increased the serum level of adiponectin (P < 0.05, respectively). Such improvements were not observed in the non-insulin resistance group. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the increase in the serum level of adiponectin was independently associated with reduction in the HOMA index.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that telmisartan improves insulin resistance that parallels an increase in the serum level of adiponectin in hypertensive patients with insulin resistance. It may therefore have advantages in treating such populations. (C) 2011 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

As a group, the asthmatics came to the studies with normal standardized percent predicted pulmonary function values. The 38 asthmatics who participated in only one exposure study were more reactive compared to the 36 asthmatics who participated in >= 4 exposure studies. The 36 asthmatics participating in >= 4 exposure studies demonstrated no significant change in their standardized percent predicted pre-exposure pulmonary function over the 7 years of the study.

"Process, practice and priorities - key lessons learnt undertaking sensitive social reconnaissance research as part of an (UNESCO-IOC) International Tsunami Survey Team","de Jong, SLV; Dominey-Howes, D; Roman, CE; Calgaro, E; Gero, A; Veland, S; Bird, DK; Muliaina, T; Tuiloma-Sua, D; Afioga, TL","The 29 September 2009 South Pacific tsunami has had a lasting impact upon local coastal villages and global collaborative research efforts. Locally, the impact of the tsunami is one of the most severe disasters Samoa has experienced in the last several decades. Within one week of the event, 143 people died. Approximately 6000 traumatized men, women and children - terrified of the sea - refused to return to live or work in their rural, coastal villages, which in turn has had broad consequences for humanitarian emergency relief distribution networks and early recovery planning efforts.Researchers came from all over the world to participate in the UNESCO International Oceanographic Commission (IOC) Samoa International Tsunami Survey Team (ITST). Focusing on the need for interdisciplinary research, for the first time, a social impact assessment team (SIT) was expressly invited to participate. Within days of the tsunami, a group of Australian, New Zealand, American, Fijian, and Japanese disaster researchers began to discuss how they might develop a social science reconnaissance research plan using innovative approaches and best practice.This paper presents an overview of challenges faced by the social impact assessment team with a focus on lessons to be learnt from this experience. We discuss the need to clarify project boundaries, develop a core research agenda and project milestones, and develop day-to-day fieldwork work plans and at the same time be sensitive to the emotional needs of the interviewees as well as the researchers. We also make several practical suggestions for future social reconnaissance research with a set of recommendations to support disaster researchers as they plan their own research projects.The inclusion of a social impacts assessment group within a UNESCO-IOC ITST was a valuable response to the increasing need for responsible social research in sensitive topics of post-disaster analysis. Social scientists are aware that disaster social science research should not be a risk to the public, and that misconduct in such work should be avoided as far as possible. We believe that the inclusion of social science experts will revolutionise conceptual, methodological and empirical approaches in future ITSTs. Social scientists will provide unprecedented volumes of high quality information on post-disaster movements, communication and response activities by individuals, communities, private and public sectors because social scientists are concerned about the integrity of the research process and results. Building upon our experiences, future ITSTs may tap into the potential that social science has to transform ITSTs capacity to gather information about disaster preparedness, what tsunami survivors saw, heard and experienced, and to reconstruct the socio-economic and political dynamics of affected communities.This paper contributes to the limited literature that outlines how to develop responsible plans and processes for post-tsunami disaster work; and, it furthers a line of inquiry applicable to a wide variety of hazards, such as flooding, cyclones, earthquakes, bushfires, pandemics and terrorism.

Participants were instructed to exercise for more than 300 min per week at the lactate threshold. Fat accumulation (intramuscular, intrahepatic, visceral and subcutaneous fat) was evaluated by computed tomography. Blood samples were taken to determine the levels of AST, ALT, PAI-1, glucose and insulin.Results: Weight, body mass index, body fat, visceral fat and subcutaneous fat decreased significantly in both groups between baseline and post-intervention (P < 0.05), but were not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). Intrahepatic fat, AST, ALT and PAI-1 improved significantly between baseline and post-intervention in the HLF group (P < 0.05; AST, P = 0.052), and improvements were significantly greater than those in the LLF group (P < 0.05). gamma GTP decreased significantly in the HLF group between baseline and post-intervention (P < 0.05), but was not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). HOMA-IR did not significantly improve between baseline and post-intervention either within or between the two groups (P > 0.05).Conclusion: This study revealed that a 12-week continuous aerobic exercise program without energy restriction might improve intrahepatic fat, liver function and atherosclerosis-related factors.

Driver performance while text messaging using handheld and in-vehicle systems,"Owens, JM; McLaughlin, SB; Sudweeks, J","This study presents an evaluation of driver performance while text messaging via handheld mobile phones and an in-vehicle texting system. Participants sent and received text messages while driving with an experimenter on a closed-road course, using their personal mobile phones and the vehicle's system. The test vehicle was an instrumented 2010 Mercury Mariner equipped with an OEM in-vehicle system that supports text messaging and voice control of mobile devices via Bluetooth. which was modified to allow text message sending during driving. Twenty participants were tested, 11 younger (19-34) and 9 older (39-51). All participants were regular users of the in-vehicle system, although none had experience with the texting functions.Results indicated that handheld text message sending and receiving resulted in higher mental demand, more frequent and longer glances away from the roadway, and degraded steering measures compared to baseline. Using the in-vehicle system to send messages showed less performance degradation, but still had more task-related interior glance time and higher mental demand than baseline; using the system's text-to-speech functionality for incoming messages showed no differences from baseline. These findings suggest that using handheld phones to send and receive text messages may interfere with drivers' visual and steering behaviors; the in-vehicle system showed improvement, but performance was not at baseline levels during message sending.

Donor-driven resource procurement for post-disaster reconstruction: Constraints and actions,"Chang, Y; Wilkinson, S; Potangaroa, R; Seville, E","Post-disaster reconstruction suffers bottlenecks and challenges due to the inadequacies of resource procurement. In the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, difficulties in acquiring resources compromised donors' efforts in achieving a successful recovery. By drawing on in-field observations and surveys in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, this paper identifies the key factors that obstructed the process for NGOs to procure building materials and labour. The result demonstrates that donor-driven resource procurement was primarily impeded by (1) NGO-related factors including: NGOs competency of resource procurement and competition for resources among aid agencies; (2) external hurdles in NGOs implementing environment including: low local transportation and supply capacity, incompetence of contractor, and insufficient government support; and (3) community-related factors including: local housing culture and lack of community influence and participation. Continuous capacity building in NGOs, proactive resource assessment and planning, strengthening relationships with local community and institutions, together with a collaborative resourcing approach are likely to address resourcing constraints faced by NGOs when rebuilding communities following a disaster.

Hyperthyrotropinemia in relation to endothelial dysfunction in obese adolescents,"El-Adawy, EH; Almulhim, AMN; Sallam, M; Agha, M; Eldien, MN","Background: It has been shown that isolated elevation of thyroid stimulating hormone (hyperthyrotropinemia) is quite frequent in obese adolescents, but it is not clear whether this condition entails an increased risk related to body mass index (BMI).Aim: The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between hyperthyrotropinemia and endothelial dysfunction and other cardiovascular risk factors in obese adolescents.Methods: Seventeen obese adolescents with hyperthyrotropinemia (TSH >= 4.2 mu UI/ml) (group 1), 21 obese adolescents with normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level (group 2) and 10 age-and sex-matched healthy lean controls were included in the study. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), lipid profile, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and thyroid hormones were determined. All participants were subjected to ultrasound recording of brachial artery diameter at rest and after reactive hyperemia (FMD) for assessment of endothelial function.Results: BMI and free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels were higher in obese adolescents with hyperthyrotropinemia (group 1) than in those with normal TSH (group 2) (p < 0.05), but there were no significant differences between the two groups in other metabolic parameters (lipid profile and HOMA-IR). The FMD was significantly low in obese adolescents (groups 1 and 2) relative to controls (3.4 +/- 18% in group 1 and 3.6 +/- 2.2% in group 2 vs. 10.4 +/- 3.1% in control subjects), but there was no statistical difference between obese adolescents with hyperthyrotropinemia (group 1) and those with normal TSH (group 2). There were positive correlations between TSH and BMI (p = 0.03) and between fT3 and BMI (p = 0.04), but no correlation between TSH and lipid profile, HOMA-IR or FMD.Conclusions: Hyperthyrotropinemia is not related to endothelial dysfunction or metabolic risk factors in obese adolescents.

Basal ganglia-dependent processes in recalling learned visual-motor adaptations,"Bedard, P; Sanes, JN","Humans learn and remember motor skills to permit adaptation to a changing environment. During adaptation, the brain develops new sensory-motor relationships that become stored in an internal model (IM) that may be retained for extended periods. How the brain learns new IMs and transforms them into long-term memory remains incompletely understood since prior work has mostly focused on the learning process. A current model suggests that basal ganglia, cerebellum, and their neocortical targets actively participate in forming new IMs but that a cerebellar cortical network would mediate automatization. However, a recent study (Marinelli et al. 2009) reported that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), who have basal ganglia dysfunction, had similar adaptation rates as controls but demonstrated no savings at recall tests (24 and 48 h). Here, we assessed whether a longer training session, a feature known to increase long-term retention of IM in healthy individuals, could allow PD patients to demonstrate savings. We recruited PD patients and age-matched healthy adults and used a visual-motor adaptation paradigm similar to the study by Marinelli et al. (2009), doubling the number of training trials and assessed recall after a short and a 24-h delay. We hypothesized that a longer training session would allow PD patients to develop an enhanced representation of the IM as demonstrated by savings at the recall tests.

"People helping turtles, turtles helping people: Understanding resident attitudes towards sea turtle conservation and opportunities for enhanced community participation in Bahia Magdalena, Mexico","Senko, J; Schneller, AJ; Solis, J; Ollervides, F; Nichols, WJ","In Pacific Mexico, all five sea turtle species have declined over the past century due to intense overexploitation of meat and eggs, fisheries bycatch, and degradation of marine and nesting habitats. One of the most heavily impacted areas has been the Baja California peninsula, where sea turtle populations remain historically low despite existing conservation measures that include a complete moratorium on the use of sea turtles, over three decades of widespread protection of nesting beaches, and in-water monitoring of sea turtles at coastal foraging areas. We recognize the need for alternative sea turtle conservation strategies that rely on increased participation of civil society and Mexican citizens. The purpose of this paper was to identify resident attitudes towards sea turtle conservation and opportunities for enhanced community participation in Bahia Magdalena, a region in Baja California Sur, Mexico experiencing high levels of sea turtle poaching and bycatch in fisheries. Through semi-structured interviews we found that while residents were overwhelmingly interested in participating in sea turtle conservation, peer pressure and conflict within the community presented major challenges. The majority of residents indicated that sea turtle voluntourism would have a positive impact on their community. Economic incentives and increased protection for sea turtles were mentioned as benefits of sea turtle voluntourism, whereas peer pressure, difficulty obtaining permits and producing effective marketing materials, and doubt about direct economic benefits were cited as constraints. We discuss our results in terms of opportunities, challenges, and recommendations for improving community-focused sea turtle conservation throughout the region. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Surface traces of the Minnivellir, Rettarnes and Tjorvafit seismic faults in the South Iceland Seismic Zone: Segmentation, lengths and magnitude of related earthquakes","Bergerat, F; Homberg, C; Angelier, J; Bellou, M","Accurate GPS mapping and field measurements have been carried out along the surface traces of three N-S right-lateral historical and prehistorical seismic strike-slip faults in the South Iceland Seismic Zone: the Minnivellir, Tjorvafit, and Rettarnes faults. We used these data and those previously collected on the Selsund and Leirubakki faults to characterise the faulting behaviour. This study illustrates a characteristic multi-scale segmentation including, from the longer to the smaller fault elements: (i) fault (corresponding to the total length of the seismic fault), (ii) fault segments, (iii) arrays of fractures and (iv) individual fractures. The most distinctive feature of such right-lateral fault is its left-stepping en-echelon arrangement at various scales, with push-up structures accommodating the motion in the relay zones. This study also highlights the role of the nature and thickness of the uppermost layer (lava flow, thin or thick grassy soil) with respect to the type and length of fractures at the surface. Our mapping reveals complex fault geometry which, however, is consistent with the general left-lateral transform behaviour of the South Iceland Seismic Zone. Some left-lateral conjugate fault branches are present along these major right-lateral faults and participate to the deformation. The estimation of the strike-slip offsets (1.3-2 m) based on the analysis of push-up structures allow to infer the total rupture lengths (45-70 km) for these faults and to estimate the magnitudes (7.0-7.2) of the related earthquakes, bringing confirmation that events significantly larger than those of June 2000 (Ms = 6.6) have occurred in the SISZ, which plays an important role for the seismic hazard assessment.

From catching to watching: Moving towards quality assurance of whale/dolphin watching tourism in Taiwan,"Chen, CL","Taiwan has shifted from harvesting whales and dolphins to protecting all cetacean species since 1990. Whales and dolphins have become major tourist attractions. With an eye on foreseeable future growth and increasing concerns about environmental impact, service delivery, and educational efficacy, the government seeks to achieve the overall quality assurance of whale/dolphin watching tourism by introducing an ecolabelling program. The aim of this study is to examine this program by analyzing its impact on tour operators and visitors. A survey method was used to assess the impact. The results showed that the program is having a positive impact on operators by seeking environmental sustainability and has brought about educational benefits for visitors, including: site-based knowledge, awareness of marine conservation and reinforcing intentions to perform environmentally responsible behaviors. However, money cost is a major factor discouraging tour operator's participation, even though ecolabels help to construct an image of responsibility. With potential educational benefits for visitors in mind, the study highlights the need for increasing public awareness of the program, expanding marketing of ecolabelled products, and providing economic incentives for tour operators to engage in ecolabelling.

Development of an Environmental Standard for Recreational Fishing Tournaments,"Diggles, BK; Sawynok, W; Olyot, LJH","Fishing tournaments are high profile events that are important to the recreational fishing industry. Tournaments are also under increasing scrutiny by governments, environmental groups, and the broader community. Much of this attention focuses on potential impacts on fish stocks, fish welfare in catch-and-release tournaments, and other issues such as potentially negative social impacts on local communities. The recreational fishing industry in Australia identified a need to be proactive in demonstrating sound environmental management of these events. The result was NEATFish, otherwise known as the Standard for National Environmental Assessment of Tournament Fishing. The NEATFish Standard is a novel concept that is based on a 1-5 star-rating system designed to provide tournament organizers with an objective assessment of how well their tournament meets certain environmental, social, and economic criteria. NEATFish was developed utilizing ISO 17050 with a pathway to allow 5-star events to migrate to a more robust certification under ISO 14001 if desired. The NEATFish Standard was developed with funding from the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation after a comprehensive consultation process with key stakeholders in the recreational fishing industry, sponsors, insurance agencies, fisheries management agencies, environmental groups, and certification bodies. Benefits to participating tournaments include reduced insurance premiums, recognition by sponsors, and greater acceptance within the broader community. The standard is currently being considered for use by several organizations, including marine parks authorities. Development of the concept is continuing through establishment of an interactive Web site, www.neatfish.com, where tournament organizers can undertake the certification process and gain accreditation online, greatly increasing the utility and uptake of the standard.",2011,,"ANGLER IN THE ENVIRONMENT: SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, BIOLOGICAL, AND ETHICAL DEMENSIONS",75,,251-261,WOS:000393632400015,,,#20336,Diggles 2011,,
An ergonomic evaluation of infant life jackets: Donning time & donning accuracy,"MacDonald, CV; Brooks, CJ; Kozey, JW; Habib, A","Canada is considering the development of a new standard for infant/child life jackets. Eight currently available (approved and non-approved) infant/child life jackets were procured for evaluation. Fifty-six participants were chosen as a sample of convenience from the general public for testing. The life jackets were divided into two groups of four, which were donned on a soft infant manikin procured from the Red Cross. In 224 attempts at donning, only 43 (19%) attempts resulted in the life jacket being donned correctly in less than 1 min. Only one life jacket came close to a good design and passed the life jacket standard for donning time and accuracy. Failure rates were observed across all the participants irrespective of age, gender, experience with children and experience with recreational marine equipment. Accuracy and speed of donning the life jacket were hampered as the number of donning sub-tasks increased. It was concluded that it is possible to design a life jacket that can be donned correctly in under 1 min. The life jacket must be of simple, intuitive design and fall naturally into the anatomical shape of the child. A minimum number of ties, zips and clips should be used in the design, and if such connectors are used they should be color coded or of different shapes and sizes to avoid confusion.

WILDLIFE CONSERVATION EDUCATION AND INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMMES,"Meadows, A","Wildlife and habitat conservation has become increasingly important in the 21st century. Destruction and loss of habitat, illegal use of wildlife, overexploitation of resources, and lack of conservation awareness, have a negative impact on biodiversity and ecosystems. The unforeseeable expectation by 2050 is that few large marine species will remain and majority of coral reefs, mangrove swamps and saltmarshes will be degraded. The wildlife carrying capacity in many protected areas will significantly reduce due to global warming, pollution, invasive species, and illegal hunting. One of the concerns is the rapidly increasing human population on the planet with 6.4 billion individuals in 2005. For global conservation a sustainable approach means that strict legislation and ethics have to be developed, together with regulating human attitudes. Conservation education and outreach techniques including learning and thinking, developing skills, and undertaking activities are described. The responsibility of Zoos to teaching their visitors by 'effective education' about the causes and types of threats, their decline and measures for conservation is more holistic. I apply as a model the role of the Zoological Society of London and its two Zoos in the development of critical and scientifically valid evaluation techniques and conservation activities, and their impact on species sanctuary in the wild. International educational programmes, are chiefly targeted towards poverty alleviation, and play an important role in delivering sustainable outputs.

Marine spatial planning: Lessons learned from the Portuguese debate,"Calado, H; Ng, K; Johnson, D; Sousa, L; Phillips, M; Alves, F","This paper presents and discusses legal, methodological and political frameworks for the development of the proposed Portuguese Marine Spatial Plan initiated in 2008. It considers lessons learned and is informed by discussions that have taken place since publication of the 'Roadmap for Maritime Spatial Planning: Achieving Common Principles in the EU'. New goals are based on horizontal planning tools that cut across sea-related sectoral policies and support joined up policy making. It is in this context that Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) emerged as an essential process for sustainable decision making. The OSPAR Commission undertook an overview of national planning systems within its administrative boundaries, which confirmed spatial plans reduced conflicts. However, problems exist accessing good quality data and dealing with entrenched sectoral views. Furthermore, the transboundary nature of marine resources requires cooperation between neighbouring states. In 2006, Portugal developed a 'National Sea Strategy' that recognized the importance of developing its maritime space while valuing marine habitats and biodiversity. MSP development of the Portuguese sea commenced in 2008 and findings are now evaluated. They showed adaptation of existing tools to be possible and desirable, provided undertaken cautiously and found conceptual ambiguities were barriers to conflict resolution. Furthermore they showed management strategies should be designed and analysed on a case by case basis, recognising temporal and spatial variations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Induced cooperation between marine nitrifiers and anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria by incremental exposure to oxygen,"Yan, J; den Camp, HJMO; Jetten, MSM; Hu, YY; Haaijer, SCM","In oxygen-limited marine ecosystems cooperation between marine nitrifiers and anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria is of importance to nitrogen cycling. Strong evidence for cooperation between anammox bacteria and nitrifiers has been provided by environmental studies but little is known about the development of such communities, the effects of environmental parameters and the physiological traits of their constituents. In this study, a marine laboratory model system was developed. Cooperation between marine nitrifiers and anammox bacteria was induced by incremental exposure of a marine anammox community dominated by Scalindua species to oxygen in a bioreactor set-up under high ammonium (40 mM influent) conditions. Changes in the activities of the relevant functional groups (anammox bacteria, aerobic ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers) were monitored by batch tests. Changes in community composition were followed by Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) and by amplification and sequencing of 16S rRNA and amoA genes. A co-culture of Scalindua sp., an aerobic ammonia-oxidizing Nitrosomonas-like species, and an aerobic (most likely Nitrospira sp.) nitrite oxidizer was obtained. Aerobic ammonia oxidizers became active immediately upon exposure to oxygen and their numbers increased 60-fold. Crenarchaea closely related to the ammonia-oxidizer Candidatus 'Nitrosopumilus maritimus' were detected in very low numbers and their contribution to nitrification was assumed negligible. Activity of anammox bacteria was not inhibited by the increased oxygen availability. The developed marine model system proved an effective tool to study the interactions between marine anammox bacteria and nitrifiers and their responses to changes in environmentally relevant conditions.

"Hair mercury levels in pregnant women in Mahshahr, Iran: Fish consumption as a determinant of exposure","Salehi, Z; Esmaili-Sari, A","MeHg is a well-documented neurotoxicant even at low levels of exposure. Developing brain, in particular, is vulnerable to that. Through bioaccumulating to differing degrees in various fish species, it can have serious adverse effects on the development and functioning of the human central nervous system, especially during prenatal exposure. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate mercury concentration in hair samples of pregnant women living in Mahshahr located in Khuzestan province, Iran. It assessed the association between fish consumption and specific characteristics that can influence exposure. From April to June 2008, 149 pregnant women were invited to participate in this study. An interview administered questionnaire was used to collect information about age, body weight, height, fish (fresh, canned and shrimp) consumption, pregnancy stage, residence duration, education level, family income and number of dental amalgam fillings. The obtained results showed that the geometric mean and range for hair total Hg concentration was 3.52 mu g/g (0.44-53.56 mu g/g). About 5.4% of mothers had hair total Hg levels in excess of 10 mu g/g. Maternal hair mercury level was less than threshold level of WHO (5 mu g/g). As expected, there was a clear increase in hair Hg with reported fresh marine fish consumption (p = 0.04). The highest mean for hair mercury level in a group who consumed fish several times per week, was 4.93 mu g/g. Moreover, a significant effect of age and residential time on Hg concentration in the hair of the women was found. Pregnant women in Mahshahr consumed large amounts of fish; consequently, most of their offspring were prenatally exposed to moderately high levels of mercury. The results found suggest that pregnant women should decrease their fish consumption. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Biophysical characterization of highly active recombinant Gaussia luciferase expressed in Escherichia coli,"Rathnayaka, T; Tawa, M; Sohya, S; Yohda, M; Kuroda, Y","Recently, the smallest bioluminescent protein (MW: 19.9 kDa), Gaussia luciferase (GLuc), has been isolated from the marine copepod Gaussia princeps and has attracted much attention as a reporter protein. However, preparation of large quantities of homogeneous natively folded recombinant GLuc appears to be difficult due to its ten cysteines. Here, we report the biophysical characterization of recombinant GLuc expressed using a novel Escherichia coli expression system based on a cold induced expression vector (pCold). Using this system, a large fraction of the protein was expressed in the soluble fraction. GLuc, purified exclusively from the supernatant using nickel affinity chromatography, yielded a large amount of pure GLuc with a native disulfide bond pattern (Soluble-GLuc). Soluble-GLuc had a strong bioluminescence activity and it retained 65% of its activity after 30 min incubation at 95 degrees C. Soluble-GLuc remained fully folded until 40 degrees C, as assessed by circular dichroism; and the thermal denaturation curve was S-shaped, indicating a cooperative transition, with a midpoint temperature of 56 degrees C. These results indicate that both the structure and bioluminescence activity of GLuc remain stable at high temperatures, and they strongly suggest GLuc's potential as a reporter protein.

"Body mass index, waist circumference, and risk of coronary heart disease: A prospective study among men and women","Flint, AJ; Rexrode, KM; Hu, FB; Glynn, RJ; Caspard, H; Manson, JE; Willett, WC; Rimm, EB","Objective: The purpose of the study was to assess the risk of CHD associated with excess weight measured by BMI and waist circumference (WC) in two large cohorts of men and women.Design, setting, subjects: Participants in two prospective cohort studies, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (N = 27,859 men; age range 39-75 years) and the Nurses' Health Study (N = 41,534 women; 39-65 years) underwent 16-year follow-up through 2004.Results: 1823 incident cases of CHD among men and 1173 cases among women were documented. Compared to men with BMI 18.5-22.9 kg/m(2), those with a BMI > 30.0 kg/m(2) had a multivariate-adjusted RR of CHD of 1.81 (95% CI 1.48-2.22). Among women, those with a BMI > 30.0 kg/m(2) had a RR of CHD of 2.16 (95% CI 1.81-2.58). Compared to men with a WC < 84.0 cm, those with WC of greater than 102.0 cm had a RR of 2.25 (95% CI 1.77-2.84). Among women, the RR of CHD was 2.75 (95% CI 2.20-3.45) for those with WC of greater than 88.0 cm.Conclusions: In these analyses from two large ongoing prospective cohort studies, both BMI and WC strongly predicted future risk of CHD. Furthermore, WC thresholds as low as 84.0 cm in men and 71.0 cm in women may be useful in identifying those at increased risk of developing CHD. The findings have broad implications in terms of CHD risk assessment in both clinical practice and epidemiologic studies. (C) 2010 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.

An insight into the performance of benthic classification indices tested in Eastern Mediterranean coastal waters,"Simboura, N; Argyrou, M","This work evaluates four indices that have been used for benthic macroinvertebrate ecological quality classification in the Mediterranean Sea. Our study was based on the data obtained from the participation of Greece and Cyprus in the Mediterranean Geographical Intercalibration group. The indices AMBI, M-AMBI, MEDOCC and BENTIX were applied to the available benthic species data, and the succession of the ecological groups along the graded values of each index was plotted. The level of agreement among methods was calculated, and the performance of each method in estimating ecological quality status was evaluated. AMBI, based on the Atlantic model, and its derivative M-AMBI overestimated the statuses, while MEDOCC showed the best level of agreement with BENTIX. BENTIX gives equal weight to tolerant and opportunistic species groups, which correlates them more closely than the other indices and makes BENTIX the most sensitive in detecting ecological disturbances in the Eastern Mediterranean basin, where tolerant and opportunistic groups seem to play an equally important role in the response of benthic communities to stressors.

Sustainable development consequences of European Union participation in Senegal's Marine Fishery,"Stilwell, J; Samba, A; Failler, P; Laloe, F",The article evaluates the impact of EU fishing activities for the sustainable development of Senegal's maritime fishery. An evaluation of Senegalese fisheries' policy discourse introduces the idea that Senegalese fisheries' policies have not been fully compatible with the sustainable development of the country's fishery sector. A comparative analysis of the sustainable development impacts associated with the activities of different fishery user groups shows that managed activities of heterogeneous user groups can benefit the sustainable development of the sector. Conclusions suggest that the heterogeneity of the user groups frequenting Senegal's marine fishery system can be capitalised upon through allocating fishery access in accord with each group's ability to generate sustainable development benefits. On the basis of these findings the article suggests that the presence of an EU fleet in Senegalese waters could play a meaningful role in ensuring the sustainable development of Senegal's marine fishery.

RDSR-V. Reliable Dynamic Source Routing for video-streaming over mobile ad hoc networks,"Munoz, JL; Esparza, O; Aguilar, M; Carrascal, V; Forne, J","Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are infrastructureless networks formed by wireless mobile devices with limited battery life. In MANETs for civilian applications, the network nodes may not belong to a single authority and they may not have a common goal. These MANETs are particularly vulnerable to selfish behavior, as some nodes may prefer saving resources to forward data. There are a few generic reputation-based systems for MANETs which could be used to enforce cooperation among nodes. However, we envision that the system performance can be highly improved by using cross-layer techniques that take into account the specific characteristics of each particular service. In this article, we propose a distributed and easy-to-implement routing mechanism based on reputation for the provision of MPEG-2 video-streaming services over MANETs. The main novelty that we introduce regarding the existent literature is that our proposal is service aware, that is to say, we consider the video-streaming service characteristics to develop a cross-layer design with the routing protocol. In addition, we do not introduce extra signaling overhead to monitor reputation because we use the standard video-streaming end-to-end signaling. Finally. simulation results show that our proposal clearly outperforms both standard Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and OCEAN (a generic reputation-based mechanism). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This French-led instrument is implemented in a cooperative scheme involving Japan (detectors), Russia (scanner) and Italy (ground calibration). PHEBUS will address the following main scientific objectives relative to Mercury's exosphere: determination of the composition and the vertical structure of the exosphere; characterization of the exospheric dynamics: day to night circulation, transport between active and inactive regions; study of surface release processes, identification and characterization of the sources of exospheric constituents'. detection and characterization of ionized species and their relation with the neutral atmosphere; space and time monitoring of exosphere/magnetosphere exchange and transport processes, study and quantification of escape, global scale source/sink balance and geochemical cycles synergistically with other experiments of BepiColombo (Mercury Sodium Atmospheric Spectral Imager (MSASI), Mercury Plasma Particle Experiment (MPPE) on Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO); Mercury imaging X-ray spectrometer (MIXS), Search for exosphere refilling and emitted neutral abundance (SERENA) on Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO)). Two gratings and two detectors are used according to a specific, compact design. The spectrum detection is based on the photon counting method and is realized using micro-channel plate (MCP) detectors with Resistive Anode Encoder (RAE). Typical photocathodes are CsI or KBr for the extreme ultra-violet (EUV) range, CsTe for the far ultra-violet (FUV) range. Extra visible lines are monitored using a photo-multiplier (PM) that is also used in photon counting mode. In order to prevent sensitivity losses which are critical in UV ranges, a minimum of reflections is achieved inside the instrument using only an off-axis parabola and a set of holographic gratings. A one degree-of-freedom in scanning system allows to probe, at the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio, selected regions and altitude ranges of interest. Different modes of observation will be used sequentially (vertical scans, along-orbit scans, grazing observations at twilight, etc.). During the mission, the instrument will be regularly calibrated on well chosen stars, in such a way to quantitatively estimate the overall degradation of the sensitivity of the instrument.

The importance of transport model uncertainties for the estimation of CO2 sources and sinks using satellite measurements,"Houweling, S; Aben, I; Breon, FM; Chevallier, F; Deutscher, N; Engelen, R; Gerbig, C; Griffith, D; Hungershoefer, K; Macatangay, R; Marshall, J; Notholt, J; Peters, W; Serrar, S","This study presents a synthetic model intercomparison to investigate the importance of transport model errors for estimating the sources and sinks of CO2 using satellite measurements. The experiments were designed for testing the potential performance of the proposed CO2 lidar A-SCOPE, but also apply to other space borne missions that monitor total column CO2. The participating transport models IFS, LMDZ, TM3, and TM5 were run in forward and inverse mode using common a priori CO2 fluxes and initial concentrations. Forward simulations of column averaged CO2 (xCO(2)) mixing ratios vary between the models by sigma = 0.5 ppm over the continents and sigma = 0.27 ppm over the oceans. Despite the fact that the models agree on average on the sub-ppm level, these modest differences nevertheless lead to significant discrepancies in the inverted fluxes of 0.1 PgC/yr per 10(6) km(2) over land and 0.03 PgC/yr per 10(6) km(2) over the ocean. These transport model induced flux uncertainties exceed the target requirement that was formulated for the A-SCOPE mission of 0.02 PgC/yr per 10(6) km(2), and could also limit the overall performance of other CO2 missions such as GOSAT. A variable, but overall encouraging agreement is found in comparison with FTS measurements at Park Falls, Darwin, Spitsbergen, and Bremen, although systematic differences are found exceeding the 0.5 ppm level. Because of this, our estimate of the impact of transport model uncerainty is likely to be conservative. It is concluded that to make use of the remote sensing technique for quantifying the sources and sinks of CO2 not only requires highly accurate satellite instruments, but also puts stringent requirements on the performance of atmospheric transport models.

BMI, WC and WSR were related to diabetes. These three obesity indicators have similar associations with incident diabetes. Areas under the ROC curves were 0.625 for BMI, 0.620 for WC, 0.611 for WSR and 0.538 for WHR.Conclusions: These data indicate that BMI was as strong as WC or WSR in predicting progression to diabetes.

Estimation of whole-body skeletal muscle mass by bioelectrical impedance analysis in the standing position,"Oshima, Y; Shiga, T; Namba, H; Kuno, S","Objective: To develop a clinical method for evaluating skeletal muscle (SM) mass using whole-body bioelectrical impedance (BI) analysis in the standing position.Subjects: Two hundred and forty-four volunteers (men = 106 and women = 138) participated in this study. The subjects were randomly separated into validation and cross-validation groups.Methods: The whole-body impedance (Z) between the hands and feet was measured in the standing position. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to develop the prediction equation for SM mass. Whole-body SM mass, measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), was used as a reference.Results: BI index (height(2)/Z), body surface area (BSA), gender, and age were selected as significant contributors to predict SM in the validation group. There was no significant difference between the measured and estimated SM mass and no systematic error in BI analysis in the cross-validation group. All data were pooled to generate the final regression equation:SM mass (kg) = (0.126 x BI index) + (1.937 x BSA)+ (-0.062 x age) + (-2.186 x gender) - 2.881,where age is in years. Gender for men = 1 and women = 2.Analysis revealed that the slope and intercept were not significantly different from one and zero, respectively. The r(2) and SEE values of the regression equation were 0.893 and 1.65 kg, respectively.Conclusions: Using our developed prediction equation, the BIA system can be used to accurately evaluate whole-body skeletal muscle mass with the subject in the standing position.

Is the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission meeting its conservation and management objectives?,"Parris, H","The Convention of the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean is a remarkable achievement in international fisheries cooperative management and significant, albeit slow and uneven, progress has been made by its Commission in promoting the conservation of vulnerable tuna stocks and managing fishing capacity. This paper evaluates current progress and suggests that further progress will be difficult to achieve unless attention is given to addressing the inherent risks in fisheries management and in the underlying incentives facing WCPFC members.

"Integrated use of antioxidant enzymes in mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, for monitoring pollution in highly productive coastal areas of Galicia (NW Spain)","Vidal-Linan, L; Bellas, J; Campillo, JA; Beiras, R","In the present work, we investigated the potential use of several antioxidant enzymes in wild mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) as biomarkers of marine pollution. The enzymatic activity levels of glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) were measured in gills and digestive gland. Those enzymes participate in the cellular defense system that is involved in the adaptive response of organisms to chemical pollution. Adult mussels were collected at five sampling sites located at the Ria de Pontevedra and Ria de Vigo. Seasonal variations in the control site were observed for the CAT activity, but no significant variability was found for GST and GPx. Mussels from the most polluted sites exhibited a significantly greater GST activity compared to the control site (p < 0.05) during the sampling period, whereas GPx and CAT activities have not such a marked pattern. Trace metals, PAHs, PCBs and DDT contents in mussels at sampling sites showed highly significant positive correlations with the GST activity.This study supports the use of GST as a useful biomarker for long-term pollution monitoring in marine coastal ecosystems, whilst more research is needed for GPx and CAT.

Concentration of selected persistent organic pollutants in blood from delivering women in South Africa,"Rollin, HB; Sandanger, TM; Hansen, L; Channa, K; Odland, JO","Environmental exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) may cause detrimental health effects in the population with the developing foetus and infants being at highest risk. This paper reports on the findings of the pilot study that took place in seven geographical regions of South Africa, 96 pregnant women admitted for delivery participated in the study. The following selected POPs were analysed in maternal plasma: 15 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) congeners (IUPAC No. 28, 52, 99, 101, 105, 118, 138, 149, 153, 156, 170, 180, 183, 187, 194): six DDT metabolites (dichlordiphenyltrichloroethane p,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDT; diphenyldichloroethylene p,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDE, dichlorophenylethane p,p'-DDD o,p'-DDD) and other pesticides such as hexachlorocyclohexames (alpha-HCH, beta-HCH, gamma-HCH), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), heptachlor, chlordanes (t-CD and c-CD), nanochlors (t-NC and c-NC) and mirex.The overall results showed large regional differences with the rural site having the lowest levels for all measured contaminants. The levels of PCB congeners were found to be low in all samples and across all sites. DDT metabolites were detected in most participants of this study and large regional differences were evident. Two malaria endemic sites, where indoor residual spraying (IRS) with DDT takes place to control malaria vector, were included in the study. The highest levels of DDTs were measured in the coastal malaria site (Indian Ocean) with geometric means of 5177 ng/g lipid and 1797 ng/g lipid for p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT, and 1966 ng/g lipid and 726 ng/g lipid for p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT in inland malaria site. gamma-HCH was found to be elevated overall, except for the urban community; the highest levels were measured in the inland and coastal malaria sites. p,p'-DDT and gamma-HCH were however not correlated, indicating different sources. The high DDT levels in the malaria spraying regions as well as the elevated gamma-HCH levels are of concern and call for extended monitoring of women and children in selected regions.

Hemocytes of the carpet shell clam (Ruditapes decussatus) and the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum): Current knowledge and future prospects,"Donaghy, L; Lambert, C; Choi, KS; Soudant, P","Hemocytes are the immune effectors in clams, directing cellular but also humoral defences. in the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) and the carpet shell clam (Ruditapes decussatus), two phenotypically similar venerid species, fishery and aquaculture importance motivated scientific studies to improve knowledge about the participation of hemocytes in immune response. Currently, gaps still persist concerning the classification of hemocyte sub-populations as well as their non-immune activities. This review summarizes current knowledge about hemocytes of the Manila clam and the carpet shell clam, suggests some probable misinterpretations arising from extrapolations from other bivalves and vertebrates, and suggests future research prospects. The susceptibility of hemocytes to environmental modifications as well as biological and chemical toxicants is also re-evaluated. Hemocytes of bivalves are not limited in function to immunity and should be considered in a wider scheme including the environment and whole-animal physiology. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"The C8 Health Project: Design, Methods, and Participants","Frisbee, SJ; Brooks, AP; Maher, A; Flensborg, P; Arnold, S; Fletcher, T; Steenland, K; Shankar, A; Knox, SS; Pollard, C; Halverson, JA; Vieira, VM; Jin, CF; Leyden, KM; Ducatman, AM","BACKGROUND: The C8 Health Project was created, authorized, and funded as part of the settlement agreement reached in the case of Jack W Leach, et al v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (no. 01-C-608 W.Va., Wood County Circuit Court, filed 10 April 2002). The settlement stemmed from the perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, or C8) contamination of drinking water in six water districts in two states near the DuPont Washington Works facility near Parkersburg, West Virginia.OBJECTIVES: This study reports on the methods and results from the C8 Health Project, a population study created to gather data that would allow class members to know their own PFOA levels and permit subsequent epidemiologic investigations.METHODS: Final study participation was 69,030, enrolled over a 13-month period in 2005-2006. Extensive data were collected, including demographic data, medical diagnoses (both self-report and medical records review), clinical laboratory testing, and determination of serum concentrations of 10 perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Here we describe the processes used to collect, validate, and store these health data. We also describe survey participants and their serum PFC levels.RESULTS: The population geometric mean for serum PFOA was 32.91 ng/mL, 500% higher than previously reported for a representative American population. Serum concentrations for perfluorohexane sulfonate and perfluorononanoic acid were elevated 39% and 73% respectively, whereas perfluorooctanesulfonate was present at levels similar to those in the U.S. population.CONCLUSIONS: This largest known population study of community PFC exposure permits new evaluations of associations between PFOA, in particular, and a range of health parameters. These will contribute to understanding of the biology of PFC exposure. The C8 Health Project also represents an unprecedented effort to gather basic data on an exposed population; its achievements and limitations can inform future legal settlements for populations exposed to environmental contaminants.",2009,,ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES,117,12,1873-1882,WOS:000272474600029,10.1289/ehp.0800379,,#20355,Frisbee 2009,,
Sediment sources of northern Quebec and Labrador glacial deposits and the northeastern sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during ice-rafting events of the last glacial cycle,"Roy, M; Hemming, SR; Parent, M","Provenance studies of anomalously high-flux layers of ice-rafted detritus (IRD) in North Atlantic sediments of the last glacial cycle show evidence for massive iceberg discharges coming from the Hudson Strait region of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS). Although these so-called Heinrich events (H events) are commonly thought to be associated with abrupt drawdown of the LIS interior, uncertainties remain regarding the sector(s) of this multi-domed ice sheet that conveyed ice through Hudson Strait. In Northern Quebec and Labrador (NQL), large-scale patterns of glacial lineations indicate massive ice flows towards Ungava Bay and Hudson Strait that could reflect the participation of the Labrador-Quebec ice dome in H events. Here we evaluate this hypothesis by constraining the source of NQL glacial deposits, which provide an estimate of the provenance characteristics of IRD originating from this sector. Specifically, we use Ar-40/Ar-39 ages of detrital hornblende grains in 25 till samples distributed along a latitudinal transect (lat. 58 degrees) extending east and west of Ungava Bay. The data show that tills located west and southwest of the Ungava Bay region are largely dominated by hornblende grains with Archean ages (>2.6 Ga), while tills located east of Ungava Bay are characterized by grains with early Paleoproterozoic ages (2.0-1.8 Ga), although most samples contain a few Archean-age grains. IRD derived from the NQL region should thus be characterized by a large proportion of Archean-age detrital grains, which contrasts significantly with the predominant Paleoproterozoic Ar-40/Ar-39 ages (1.8-1.6 Ga) typically reported for the dominant age population of hornblende grains in H layers. Comparisons with IRD through the last glacial cycle from a western North Atlantic core off Newfoundland do not show evidence for any prominent ice-rafted event with the provenance characteristics of NQL glacial deposits, thereby suggesting that significant ice-calving event(s) from the Labrador-Quebec sector may have been limited throughout that interval. Although these results tend to point towards a relative stability of this ice dome during H events, our study also indicates that further provenance work is required on IRD proximal to the Hudson Strait mouth in order to constrain with a greater confidence the sector(s) of the LIS that fed ice into Hudson Strait during H events. Alternatively, these results and other paleogeographic considerations tend to support models suggesting that part of the Ungava Bay glacial lineations could be associated with a Late-Glacial ice flow across Hudson Strait.

Bariatric surgery or lifestyle intervention? An exploratory study of severely obese patients' motivation for two different treatments,"Strommen, M; Kulseng, B; Vedul-Kjelsas, E; Johnsen, H; Johnsen, G; Marvik, R","Background: In the complex field of treating severe obesity, motivation is receiving increased attention. This explorative study aims to highlight what influences the preferences of severely obese patients deciding for either gastric bypass surgery or lifestyle treatment.Methods: Patients awaiting laparoscopic gastric bypass were presented with an 18-week inpatient lifestyle programme alternative to gastric bypass. Questionnaires provided qualitative data (reasons for choosing one treatment over another) and quantitative data (mental health assessment using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). The material was analysed according to a sequential exploratory design involving thematic analysis of patients' arguments, validation using HADS, and statistical computations (hypothesis testing) with one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post hoc test.Results: 159 participants (mean BMI 47.2 kg/m(2)) returned questionnaires of which 32% wanted the lifestyle treatment alternative to surgery. Reasons for choosing the two treatments varied widely as did also the corresponding data on mental health. Two subgroups stood out with particularly high mental symptom scores, namely patients choosing surgery due to reluctance to engage in social interaction in lifestyle treatment, and patients preferring lifestyle treatment due to the fear of dying during general anaesthesia. These two subgroups showed significantly higher symptom scores than other subgroups within their therapy-of-choice group. The number of comorbid diseases was also found to impact upon motivation.Conclusions: Patients carry different incentives for choosing the same type of treatment. On a subgroup level, psychopathological symptoms seem to follow motivational patterns. Analysing motivation and mental health may provide measures for identifying subgroups with various prospects for therapy outcome. (C) 2009 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.

"Effects of Unsaturated Fat Dietary Supplements on Blood Lipids, and on Markers of Malnutrition and Inflammation in Hemodialysis Patients","Ewers, B; Riserus, U; Marckmann, P","Objective: We examined the effects of commercially available unsaturated fat dietary supplements on blood lipids, and on markers of malnutrition and inflammation, in an adult population of hemodialysis (HD) patients.Design: This was a restricted, randomized (equal blocks), investigator-blinded 2 X 6 week crossover trial, without a washout interval.Setting: This study was conducted at the Department of Nephrology, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Herlev, Denmark, in spring 2007.Patients: Participants included 40 (30 males and 10 females) stable, adult patients undergoing regular HD, with a mean age of 64.6 years and a mean body mass index of 23.3 kg/m(2),Intervention: In addition to patients' habitual diets, oral unsaturated fat supplements (90 mL of Calogen [SHS International, Ltd., Liverpool, UK] and 4 capsules of Pikasol [Dansk Droge, Ishoej, Denmark]) were given in one period, whereas no supplements were given in the other. Dietary supplements contributed 1.8 MJ (430 kcal), 47 g fat, 26.5 g monounsaturated fatty acids, and 3 g marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids per day. Blood sampling and nutritional assessments were performed at baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 12 weeks.Main Outcome Measures: Dietary intakes, blood lipids, dry body weight, serum albumin, and serum C-reactive protein comprised our main outcome measures.Results: According to a per-protocol analysis of 14 study completers, fat supplementation resulted in significantly increased total energy intake (+1.6 MJ/day, or 380 kcal/day) and an increased dietary fat energy percentage (+9%). We observed no significant changes in blood lipids. Dry body weight (+0.49 kg, P = .04) increased, and serum C-reactive protein concentration fell (-1.69 mg/L, P = .01), with fat supplementation. Intention-to-treat analysis of 39 participants confirmed the absence of adverse blood-lipid changes.Conclusions: Unsaturated fat supplementation increased total dietary energy intake to recommended levels, had no adverse impact on blood lipids, improved nutritional status as assessed according to dry body weight, and reduced systemic inflammation as assessed according to C-reactive protein serum concentrations. Adding unsaturated fat to the diet seems to be a safe and effective way to prevent and treat malnutrition in hemodialysis patients. (C) 2009 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

Comparison of two self-directed weight loss interventions: Limited weekly support vs. no outside support,"Smith, BK; Van Walleghen, EL; Cook-Wiens, G; Martin, RN; Curry, CR; Sullivan, DK; Gibson, CA; Donnelly, JE","Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of two home-based weight loss interventions that differ only in the amount of outside support provided.Methods: This was a 12-week, randomized, controlled trial. One group received limited support (LWS, n = 35) via a single 10 min phone call each week while another group received no weekly support (NWS, n = 28). Both the LWS and NWS received pre-packaged meals (PM) and shakes. A third group served as control (CON, n = 30) and received no components of the intervention. Weight loss at 12 weeks was the primary outcome. Diet (PM, shake, and fruit/vegetable (F/V) intake) and physical activity (PA) were self-monitored, recorded daily and reported weekly. An exit survey was completed by participants in the intervention groups upon completion of the study.Results: Weight toss and percent weight loss in the LWS, NWS, and CON groups were 7.7 +/- 4.4 kg (8.5 +/- 4.2%), 5.9 +/- 4.1 kg (6.0 +/- 4.2%), and 0.3 +/- 1.9 kg (0.4 +/- 1.2%), respectively. The decrease in body weight and percent weight loss was significantly greater in the LWS and NWS groups when compared to the CON group and the percent weight loss was significantly greater in the LWS when compared to both the NWS and CON groups.Conclusion: A home-based weight loss program utilizing PM and shakes results in clinically significant percent weight loss and the addition of a brief weekly call promotes additional percent weight loss.

New clinical studies Suggest that low-dose TTX can safely relieve severe, treatment-resistant cancer pain. The therapeutic potential of TTX in addiction is supported by studies in laboratory animals. The purpose of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to assess the effect of a single intramuscular dose of TTX on cue-induced craving and anxiety in abstinent heroin addicts.Methods: Forty-five abstinent heroin addicts were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: placebo, 5 mu g TTX, or 10 mu g TTX. Participants were exposed to a neutral video or a heroin-related video. Craving. anxiety, blood pressure, and heart rate were measured pre- and post-exposure.Results: Heroin-related cues increased both craving and anxiety and had no effect on blood pressure and heart rate. A single dose of TTX dose-dependently attenuated the increases in craving and anxiety while having no effect on blood pressure or heart rate.Conclusion: The results suggest that low-dose TTX is acutely effective in reducing cue-induced increases in heroin craving and associated anxiety.

Changes in food intake patterns associated with body weight loss during a 12-week health promotion program and a 9-month follow-up period in a Japanese population,"Nakade, M; Lee, JS; Kawakubo, K; Kondo, K; Mori, K; Akabayashi, A","Recently, food intake pattern analysis associated with body weight has been conducted instead of traditional dietary analysis focusing on a single nutrient or food group, but there have been few studies examining the association between change in food intake patterns and body weight loss. In this study, short- and tong-term relationships between changes in food intake patterns and body weight loss were examined. Subjects were 506 overweight/obese men and women who participated in a 12-week health promotion program and a follow-up check 9 months later. Diet was assessed with a FFQ and food intake patterns named ""Plant foods and seafood"" and ""Sweets, meats, dairy products and alcohol"" were derived by cluster analysis using the intake of 17 food groups at the baseline. During the program, body weight* toss of the subjects changed pattern from ""Sweets, meats, dairy products and alcohol"" to ""Plant foods and seafood"" (SP group) was significantly Larger than that of the subjects who showed an opposite pattern change (PS group) or the subjects who maintained ""Sweets, meats, dairy products and alcohol"" pattern after adjusting for age, sex, body weight at the baseline, changes in energy intake and exercise habit. Body weight loss of the SP group was also significantly greater than that of the PS group during the follow-up period. Changes in food intake patterns were related to body weight loss and changing the pattern from ""Sweets, meats, dairy products and alcohol"" to ""Plant foods and seafood"" was most effective for short- and long-term body weight loss.

An experimental simulation study of advanced decision support system for ship navigation,"Nilsson, R; Garling, T; Lutzhoft, M","A bridge with an integrated navigation system is compared to a less advanced conventionally equipped bridge in a full mission ship simulator to assess the extent to which fairway navigation benefits from information aids. Realistic scenarios were constructed including several demanding situations when navigating in a fairway. Twenty-two teams each consisting of two members with varying experience as Master Mariners and navigating officers participated in a repeated-measures design. Workload, performance and affective responses were measured. No statistical differences between the bridges were found on any of the dependent measures. The results imply that other factors than the available technology account for the observed differences across teams. A tendency was observed that experienced navigation officers performed better on the conventional bridge than the technically advanced bridge, whilst the opposite was true for less experienced navigation officers.

The VIP system was designed to allow in situ simultaneous monitoring of the dynamic fractions (i.e. the maximum potentially bioavailable fractions) of Cu(II). Pb(II) and Cd(II) in natural waters at a frequency of 2-3 analyses h(-1).The four participating groups used the VIP systems under laboratory conditions to determine dissolved concenterations of Cu, Pb and Cd in river, estuarine and coastal water reference materials (SLRS-3/4, SLEW-2/3 and CASS3/4, respectively). The accuracy of the VIP method was comparable to that of established methodologies, including inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and voltammetric methods using mercury-electrodes. The VIP systems were also applied to determine the dynamic fractions of the target analytes in freshly collected samples ex situ, as well as in situ in contrasting European marine waters. There was good agreement between the concentrations of the dynamic metal fractions determined in laboratory analyses, and observed during the Simultaneous deployment of up to five VIP instruments for periods of several hours in coastal waters. The simultaneous in situ deployment of two VIP instruments in an estuary showed a consistent analytical performance over several days of continuous operation. The results of this inter-comparison exercise show that the VIP system is a reliable submersible probe for accurate, sensitive and high resolution in situ monitoring of dissolved metal fractions in the picomolar (Cd, Pb) and nanomolar (Cu) concentration ranges.

Slow steps towards management of the world's largest tuna fishery,"Langley, A; Wright, A; Hurry, G; Hampton, J; Aqorua, T; Rodwel, L","Today, the tuna fishery of the western and central Pacific is one of the world's largest fisheries. Annual catches exceed 2 million mt-approximately 50% of the global tuna catch-with an estimated landed value of USD 3 billion (in 2005). The fishery expanded rapidly from the mid 1980s, following the development of the purse-seine fishery. From the mid 1990s, it was recognised that a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation was required to facilitate cooperation in the management of the resource. Following almost a decade of negotiations and planning, the Western and Central Pacific Fishery Commission (WCPFC) was established in 2004. During the interim period, stock assessments for the key tuna species were developed and revealed that for two species (yellowfin and bigeye tuna) there was concern regarding the increased levels of fishing mortality. However, declarations and resolutions calling for restraint in the expansion of fishing effort were largely unheeded over the last decade and, to date, the WCPFC has been unable to introduce any measures to effectively reduce (or limit) the level of fishing mortality on yellowfin and bigeye tuna. This paper proposes a number of mechanisms for improving the performance of the WCPFC with respect to meeting the conservation and management objectives of the commission and argues that Pacific Island nations need to collectively take the lead to ensure the effective management of the resource.

Involving the public in the impact assessment of offshore renewable energy facilities,"Portman, M","Public participation in decision-making about development has many benefits especially in the coastal zone and in the near-shore marine environment. This research expands the discussion of public involvement in decisions about marine resource use by examining public participation in environmental impact assessment as relevant for offshore renewable energy facilities. A review of empirical and theoretical research supports the development of a framework for further analysis. The framework consists of five main features: (1) effective communication, (2) broad-based inclusion, (3) prioritization, (4) early three-way learning, and (5) alternatives analysis. The paper's concluding sections explore the relevance of such a framework and indicate possible applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The transport of carbon and hydrogen in subducted oceanic crust: An experimental study to 5 GPa,"Poli, S; Franzolin, E; Fumagalli, P; Crottini, A","Carbon and hydrogen residence time in the Earth's interior is controlled by complex phase equilibria attained in the subduction zone environment. Carbonic fluid/melts are highly mobile, whereas graphite-diamond are refractory and sluggishly participate in subsolidus reactions; on the contrary carbonates although refractory are extremely reactive. Inclusions of diamond/graphite+carbonates+hydrates in both orogenic and subcratonic mantle remnants reveal that the fates of C and H are intimately related.Experiments were carried out on an altered MORB bulk composition at P from 2.2 to 5.0 GPa and T from 680 degrees C to 800 degrees C, in the presence of a fluid at variable C-O-H ratios and amounts. The role of variable redox conditions was explored buffering fH(2) at NNO and HM equilibria using a double capsule technique.Amphibole breaks down at 2.5-2.6 GPa, epidote persists to 2.7 GPa, 730 degrees C and talc to 3.3 GPa, 800 degrees C. Graphite is ubiquitous above 2.0 GPa at both hydrogen fugacities. At P > 2.0 GPa and fH(2) buffered by NNO, dolomite was recovered at 3.0 GPa, 730 degrees C only, in an experiment with large amount of volatiles added. On the contrary, at fH(2) buffered by HM, carbonate phase fields get wider with pressure: aragonite and/or dolomite are stable up to 2.4 GPa and at higher pressure they are replaced by coexisting magnesite and dolomite. Mg-calcite forms at 4.6-5.0 GPa, 800 degrees C. Unexpectedly, lawsonite was found to coexist with magnesite at temperatures as high as 700 degrees C at 3.3 GPa, and 730 degrees C at 4.2 GPa, revealing a thermal stability in C-O-H bearing systems exceeding by more than 30 degrees C that found in mafic assemblages in the presence of hydrous species only. Chemographic analysis reveals that pressure-temperature stability of lawsonite in basaltic compositions is promoted by CO2 addition and by the oceanic alteration processes.In C-O-H bearing systems, complex mass-balance relations govern the partitioning of volatiles between fluid, hydrates, carbonates, and graphite/diamond at fixed fH(2). In natural systems, the relative amounts of ferric/ferrous iron in garnet and clinopyroxene versus C/carbonate control fluid speciation. The potential production of C-O-H fluid mixtures is evaluated and a heterogeneous oxidation of the subducting lithosphere is suggested as a source for distinct fluid populations. Upon mixing, these fluids promote carbon precipitation. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A field laboratory for monitoring CO2 leakage,"Dillen, M; Lindeberg, E; Aagaard, P; Aker, E; Saether, OM; Johansen, H; Lien, M; Hatzignatiou, DG; Golmen, L; Hellevang, J","The long-term safety of future CO2 storage projects in aquifers will not only rely on a comprehensive geological characterisation of the formation and capillary seal, but also on the ability to effectively monitor the underground migration of CO2 to allow immediate and effective remediation to prevent CO2 from escaping to the atmosphere in case of leakage. To achieve such effective remediation it is necessary that deep-probing monitoring tools can detect any leakage at an early stage long before CO2 has reached the surface. It will also be necessary to conduct shallow monitoring, at the perimeter of the storage system, where leakage to the atmosphere or ocean is imminent. Field-scale experimental observations have been designed and planned to study the sensitivity of various existing monitoring systems as a mean of monitoring CO2 leakage. Two onshore geological formations in Norway have been identified as suitable for systematic studies of detection limits for monitoring technologies in a well-controlled geological environment. One of the sites consists of Quaternary unconsolidated sand with a high porosity and permeability, allowing fast CO2 plume rise and the possibility of creating chimney-like plumes. The other site is a low-permeable Permian consolidated sandstone, where viscous forces will be stronger during the injection phase, thus permitting more variations in the plume shape depending on the injection rate. At both selected sites, small amounts of CO2 will be injected into the geological formations, which have no seal that will prevent the CO2 upward migration through the underground strata. The CO2 plumes will therefore mimic a potential leakage from an actual storage site and, by frequently repeating monitoring measurements, the performance of different methods will be tested. These monitoring measurements will include geophysical, down-hole, ecological/environmental, chemical/geochemical, atmospheric, and satellite methods. The results of the project will illustrate the performance of different monitoring technologies and provide reference for further developments of the methods, if needed. Various research organisations from United Kingdom, France and Norway will participate in the design and implementation of this project along with the project's industrial partners.

"""AGUGLIA"". Why not going straight to density?","IEEE; Gualdesi, L; Manzella, GMR; de Strobel, F","The monitoring of oceans and seas is performed with different platforms, some of which profile the water column, measuring temperature and salinity. An important goal of current monitoring activities is the provision of quasi-synoptic four-dimensional maps of water mass properties. Technological platforms such as lagrangian profilers, or autonomous vehicles, have missions that include parking depths or acquisition of data with predefined density layers. There are still some disadvantages in the actual technologies. Autonomous vehicles have a speed that is insufficient to counter to current fields that might transform their planned Eulerian path into a Lagrangian drifting mode, following the water mass they were supposed to pierce. Other operational limitations include the still high running cost of CTD platforms that are not yet ready for a ""launch it and wait for data"" policy. Finally, the achievements of operational missions are partially hampered by the inability to have an exact knowledge of the water mass density.The possibility to directly measure water mass density as opposed to the usual conductivity/salinity measurement is of paramount importance for observational strategies, as well as for numerical models, that the sole equation for density, can eventually replace the three equations for the calculation of temperature, salinity and density. The actual calculation of density from in-situ temperature, conductivity and depth information is affected by uncertainties due to the experimental algorithm in use and the combination of errors generated by the measurement of three parameters instead than one.Historically it is fascinating to note that the approach proposed has already been adopted more than three centuries ago by one of oceanography's founders, the Count Luigi Ferdinando Marsili, in his work on the Bosphorus Strait water circulation. The direct measurement of density also has various practical applications on platforms such as ARGO or AUVs that can profile more precise density ranges.The vehicle described here, AGUGLIA (Garfish), can be launched at sea where it will reach a falling speed that is a direct function of water mass density changes, after a careful and specific density calibration vs. a 1000m sea depth, simulated in a pressure tank to deduct the unavoidable minor structural compression.A clock and a pressure sensor accurately measure this falling speed. In situ calibration of AGUGLIA is made by changing its density and stopping its run to match the corresponding density of a given water mass (Lagrangian mode). Depth is also double checked by placing two pressure sensors at a known constructional vertical distance in the vehicle hull. Its hydrodynamics, although simplified due to cost minimization, is able to achieve low energy consumption in water penetration and course stability during surface transfers, due to its slender longitudinal hull resembling that of a Garfish.This hybrid capability of being self propelled like an AUV, as opposed to a fully passive glider mode, is an essential feature when one needs fast re-direction for cooperative work as well as when facing a current front or needing to reach the surface fast in order to mark a fix.",2009,,"OCEANS 2009, VOLS 1-3",,,2120-+,WOS:000280322601037,,,#20370,IEEE 2009,,
Counting biodiversity waste in industrial eco-efficiency: fisheries case study,"Willison, JHM; Cote, RP","The foundation for the creation of eco-efficiency metrics for industrial impacts on biodiversity is considered. Because biodiversity is the essence of life itself, these metrics are essential for effectiveness in the theory and practice of eco-efficiency, particularly in the case of primary natural resource extraction industries such as fishing and forestry. The case of fishing is examined, with particular attention to by-catch, lost nets, and habitat damage caused by mobile fishing gears. It is appropriate to examine fishing because industrial era impacts on marine biodiversity have been severe and are driving large and deleterious changes in marine ecosystems. For discarded by-catch, it is proposed that an eco-efficient metric for the value per unit mass of discarded fish can be set to be equivalent to that of the market value of the utilized catch. In estimating the eco-efficient value of the catch, the value of the discarded fish is then subtracted from the market value of the catch. Fish killed in lost nets can be treated similarly. It is more difficult to address marine habitat damage by mobile fishing gear, which has the highest potential for ecological injury.By using the approach proposed, negative eco-efficiencies are obtained under circumstances in which the collateral damage to biodiversity exceeds the economic benefit obtained. This is a logical outcome given the long-term effects of biodiversity decline. A metric is also proposed for assessing whether avoidance of harm to biodiversity, in the form of switching fishing gear, is required. Lastly it is proposed that metrics might be developed to provide eco-efficiency credit for companies taking effective actions to improve, or actively participate in, ecosystem-based fisheries management.

The 'living-fossil community' of the cyrtocrinid Cyathidium foresti and the deep-sea oyster Neopycnodonte zibrowii (Azores Archipelago),"Wisshak, M; Neumann, C; Jakobsen, J; Freiwald, A","From the steep submarine slope of the southern Faial Channel (Azores Archipelago), a conspicuous archibenthic community of two 'living fossils', comprising the up to 30 cm sized deep-sea oyster Neopycnodonte zibrowii and the sessile cyrtocrinid Cyathidium foresti, is described. Both thrive in particularly high densities concealed underneath bedrock overhangs in 420-500 m water depth under comparatively stable environmental conditions (12.3 +/- 0.25 degrees C and open marine salinity). Other faunal elements include various sponges, bryozoans, serpulid worms, and large barnacles.Submersible investigations showed that the direct association of C foresti and N. zibrowii is not obligatory. The crinoid is commonly encountered settling on dead as well as live oysters, which provide benefits for the crinoid in terms of substrate availability and/or participation in the oysters' active feeding current. The upside down position of both species provides protection from background sedimentation and possibly shelter from predators. After death and partial disarticulation, the crinoids are commonly overgrown by other oysters or subsequent crinoid generations, mirroring limited substrate availability.Both genera, represented by the type species Cyathidium holopus and Pycnodonte sp., respectively, are also found as fossils more than 60 million years old in the Middle Danian (Paleocene) of Faxe in Denmark. Associated with coral limestone, C holopus was found occasionally in impressive numbers either isolated or settling on various substrata, such as scleractinian corals, other Cyathidium calyxes, and - analogous to the Azorean occurrence - the inner surface of pycnodontine oysters. Previous palaeohabitat models for C holopus such as the pseudoplanktonic attachment to drifting wood or attachment to cave ceilings in a photic reef, are rejected in favour of an interpretation of this association thriving on small hardground cliffs and under overhangs in a deep-shelf palaeoenvironment, associated with the cold- and deep-water coral bioherms proposed by recent palaeoenvironment assessments.We assume a habitat-shift of the cyrtocrinids from presumable shallow palaeoenvironments in the Late Cretaceous toward a deep shelf setting in the Danian, which reflects the escape from enhanced predation pressure during the 'Mesozoic Marine Revolution'. Sessile crinoids almost completely vanished from shallow waters and were replaced by mobile and often strictly nocturnal comatulids. The Cyathidium/(Neo)pycnodonte association did not only survive the Cretaceous/Palaeogene mass extinction, but the whole of the Cenozoic and can today be studied as a 'living-fossil community'.

Evaluating collaborative fisheries management planning: A Canadian case study,"Davis, NA","Governing agencies increasingly employ collaborative forms of decision-making in fisheries management to improve decision quality and legitimacy. However, crafting fair and effective collaborative processes that will achieve these benefits is often difficult.

Results indicate that an incentive to participate, consensus decision-making, and independent facilitation were essential to ensuring the fairness and effectiveness of the process.

Review of methodologies for composite material modelling incorporating failure,"Orifici, AC; Herszberg, I; Thomson, RS","Advanced composite materials are finding increasing application in aerospace, marine and many other industries due to the advantages in performance, structural efficiency and cost they provide. However, despite years of extensive research around the world, a complete and validated methodology for predicting the behaviour of composite structures including the effects of damage has not yet been fully achieved. The Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures (CRC-ACS) is leading a currently running collaborative project to develop a methodology for determining mechanical behaviour and failure in composite structures. Key drivers of the project are the use of multi-axial testing machines for material characterisation and an appreciation of the issues involved due to the different length scales of any analysis. As part of the project, a critical review was performed to assess the state of the art in material constitutive modelling and composite failure theories. This paper summarise the results of the review, which includes a discussion of the various theories and approaches within the context of the dissipated energy density framework. The results of the review will be applied within the project to select appropriate constitutive modelling and failure approaches for implementation within a data-driven material characterisation methodology.

Thermoregulatory responses of junior lifesavers wearing protective clothing,"Sinclair, WH; Crowe, MJ; Spinks, WL; Leicht, AS","This study investigated the influence of protective clothing worn to prevent marine stinger envenomation on the thermoregulatory responses of prepubescent surf lifesavers exercising in situ under hot and humid conditions (27 degrees C, 78% relative humidity). Participants performed beach and water activities typically associated with junior surf lifesaving competition in a randomised cross-over design on two separate occasions 7 days apart: one wearing a full-length Lycra stinger suit (S) and one wearing normal swimwear (SW). Skin (T-SK) and core (T-C) body temperatures, skin blood flow (SKBF), heart rate (HR), body mass, thermal comfort and perceived effort were assessed pre-, mid- (following beach activities) and post-exercise (following water activities). Sweat rates were compared between S and SW. T-C was greater following beach activities for S (37.78 degrees C 0.06) compared to SW (37.60 degrees C +/- 0.07; p < 0.05) and mate participants experienced greater T-C (37.97 degrees C +/- 0.09) than their female counterparts (37.71 degrees C +/- 0.07 degrees C). TSK following both the beach and water activities were lower than pre-exercise (p < 0.05). SKBF was significantly increased for calf across time (p < 0.01). Mate participants experienced a higher HR for S compared to female participants (p < 0.01) while the opposite applied to SW (p < 0.01). There were no gender or between-condition differences for sweat rate or perceived effort. There was evidence of heat storage white stinger suits were worn during beach activities in the absence of any differences in exercise intensity or sweat rate. The results of the present study suggest that the stinger suits should be limited to water-based activities. (c) 2007 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Quality of life after gastric banding in morbidly obese Dutch patients: Long-term follow-up,"Kiewiet, RM; Durian, MF; Cuijpers, LPLH; Hesp, FLEM; van Vliet, ACM","Objective: Long-term effects of adjustable gastric banding (AGB) on quality of life (QoL) in a morbidly obese population were investigated in a cross-sectional study. Additionally, determinants of QoL after AGB were assessed.Methods: All patients treated by AGB for morbid obesity in a Dutch hospital were invited to complete the RAND 36-Item Health Survey. Of 121 participating patients 59 met the criteria for long-term follow-up (>5 years): 4 mate and 55 female, mean age 42.4 +/- 9.7 years, mean body mass index (BMI) before surgery 44.9 +/- 5.9 kg /m(2). Time since surgery was 74.7 months (range 60-107.6). The control group consisted of 28 presurgical patients. General and obesity-related parameters were assessed for correlation with QoL.Results: Significant differences between the preoperative group and Dutch community norm (CN) values were found on five out of eight QoL subscates, in favor of CN. AGB induced significant weight loss in the postoperative group: 56.1 % excess weight loss (%EWL). This group scored significantly better than the preoperative group on one out of eight subscales: physical functioning (P=0.019). Additionally, scores on four out of eight subscales were stilt significantly impaired compared to CN. Postoperative BMI and %EWL influenced QoL after tong-term follow-up, whereas weight regain had no negative impact.Conclusions: This study shows that after long-term follow-up subjects treated by gastric banding to induce weight toss have a slightly better QoL than those who did not undergo surgery yet. QoL remains impaired in comparison to the general population. After tong-term follow-up BMI and weight toss do influence QoL whereas weight regain does not have any negative impact.

An overview of the ERICA Integrated Approach to the assessment and management of environmental risks from ionising contaminants,"Larsson, CM","The ERICA project (environmental risks from ionising contaminants: assessment and management, EC contract no. F16R-CT-2004-508847) concluded with the publication of two main outputs: the ERICA Integrated Approach to the assessment and management of environmental risks from ionising radiation, of which also introduces the user to the second main output, the ERICA Tool, which is a software programme with supporting databases, that together with its associated help will guide users through the assessment process. More than 60 European scientists contributed to the ERICA Integrated Approach. In addition, a large number of experts, policy makers, and decision-makers in different areas have contributed views on the ERICA Integrated Approach and its associated Tool from the user's perspective, through participation in the End-Users Group set up under the ERICA project. Databases on transfer, dose conversion coefficients and radiation effects on biota have been developed specifically for the purpose of the Integrated Approach, and incorporated into, or interacting with, the Tool. Species sensitivity distributions of biological effects data have been performed and did not reveal, for chronic exposure, any statistical grounds for separation between terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems in terms of species sensitivity to radiation; on the basis of such analysis a universal screening dose rate criterion of 10 mu Gy h(-1) incremental dose rate is suggested for exiting the assessment procedure while being confident that environmental risks are negligible. This criterion is used for the two first tiers (conservative assessment with limited data requirement and various possibilities of incorporating user-defined parameter values, including the screening dose rate criterion) of the assessment methodology. Exposure situations of concern are carried through a third tier, making use of all relevant databases and with a number of issues and options listed to support and guide decision-making. This article provides an overview to the ERICA Integrated Approach, whereas further articles of this special issue describe in-depth different vital aspects of the Integrated Approach.

"The missing layer: Geo-technologies, communities, and implications for marine spatial planning","St Martin, K; Hall-Arber, M","The assessment and management of marine resources is an increasingly spatial affair dependent upon emerging geo-technologies, such as geographic information systems, and the subsequent production of diverse layers of spatial information. These rapid developments are, however, focused on biophysical processes and data collection initiatives: the social landscape of the marine environment is undocumented and remains a ""missing layer"" in decision-making. As a result, the resource areas upon which stakeholders and communities are dependent are neither mapped nor integrated into planning processes. We report on a participatory method to map the presence of fishing communities at-sea.

Female alternative reproductive behaviors: The effect of female group size on mate assessment and copying,"Brennan, BJ; Flaxman, SM; Alonzo, SH","Extensive theoretical and empirical research has focused on male alternative reproductive tactics. In comparison, female alternative tactics have attracted little attention, and further theoretical and empirical research are needed. Using a game theoretical model, we examine female choice alternatives (1) by considering assessment errors in a novel and more realistic manner than done previously, and (2) for the first time, by highlighting the formation of groups of females as an important consequence of copying behavior. We consider. two alternatives: direct assessment of male quality by females and female copying of the choice of other females. Assessment and copying are predicted to coexist under a wide variety of circumstances and copying is favored when females make assessment errors, when high-quality males are either common or very rare, and when female fitness declines with the number of other females choosing the same male. We also find that the frequency of copying at equilibrium is predicted to decrease when the presence of other females mating with the same male has a positive effect on female fitness (e.g. through increased male parental effort, decreased predation risk or cooperation among females). Female alternative choice tactics also influence the potential for sexual selection. In our model, when the frequency of copying females is low, the potential for sexual selection can be higher than in the absence of female copying. However, contrary to previous theory, we find that as copying females become more common than assessing females, the potential for sexual selection will be low as more females copy the mate choice of other copiers without assessment.

International cooperation among nation-states of the North Pacific Ocean on the problem of competition among salmon for a common pool of prey resources,"Holt, CA; Rutherford, MB; Peterman, RM","A common-pool problem in the North Pacific Ocean that remains largely ignored in international policy is competition for prey resources among salmon populations (Oncorhynchus spp.) from different countries. Hatcheries release large abundances of juvenile salmon into the North Pacific and the resulting decrease in mean body size of adult wild and hatchery salmon may lead to reductions in benefits. We examine incentives and disincentives for cooperation among nation-states on this issue. We recommend that either a new international organization be created or that amendments be made to the mandate and powers of an existing organization. The resulting organization could encourage collective action to reduce competition among salmon from different nations by using side-payments to change the incentive structure, by establishing a multi-national scientific assessment team to create a common frame of reference for the problem, and by implementing policy prescriptions.

MICS-Asia II: Model intercomparison and evaluation of ozone and relevant species,"Han, Z; Sakurai, T; Ueda, H; Carmichael, GR; Streets, D; Hayami, H; Wang, Z; Holloway, T; Engardt, M; Hozumi, Y; Park, SU; Kajino, M; Sartelet, K; Fung, C; Bennet, C; Thongboonchoo, N; Tang, Y; Chang, A; Matsuda, K; Amann, M","Eight regional Eulerian chemical transport models (CTMs) are compared with each other and with an extensive set of observations including ground-level concentrations from EANET, ozone soundings from JMA and vertical profiles from the TRACE-P experiment to evaluate the models' abilities in simulating O-3 and relevant species (SO2, NO, NO2, HNO3 and PAN) in the troposphere of East Asia and to look for similarities and differences among model performances. Statistical analysis is conducted to help estimate the consistency and discrepancy between model simulation and observation in terms of various species, seasons, locations, as well as attitude ranges. In general, all models show a good skill of simulating SO2 for both ground level and the lower troposphere, although two of the eight models systematically overpredict SO2 concentration. The model skills for O-3 vary largely with region and season. For ground-level O-3, model results are best correlated with observations in July 2001. Comparing with O-3 soundings measured in the afternoon reveals the best consistency among models in March 2001 and the largest disparity in O-3 magnitude in July 2001, although most models produce the best correlation in July as well. In terms of the statistics for the four flights of TRACE-P experiment, most models appear to be able to accurately capture the variability in the lower troposphere. The model performances for NOx are relatively poor, with lower correlation and with almost all models tending to underpredict NOx levels, due to larger uncertainties in either emission estimates or complex chemical mechanism represented. All models exhibit larger RMSE at altitudes < 2 km than 2-5.5 kin, mainly due to a consistent tendency of these models towards underprediction of the magnitude of intense plumes that often originate from near surface. Relatively lower correlation at altitudes 2-5.5 km may be attributed to the models' limitation in representing convection or potential chemical processes. Most of the key features in species distribution have been consistently reproduced by the participating models, such as the O-3 enhancement in the western Pacific Ocean in March and in northeast Asia in July, respectively, although the absolute model values may differ considerably from each other. Large differences are found among models in the southern parts of the domain for all the four periods, including southern China and northern parts of some Southeast Asia countries where the behaviors of chemical components and the ability of these models are still not clearly known because of a lack of observational databases.

The definition of marine recreational fishing in Europe,"Pawson, MG; Glenn, H; Padda, G","To describe marine recreational fisheries, their socio-economic importance and interactions with other fisheries and the environment, it is necessary to define what is meant by recreational fishing. A review of European Member States' national legislation revealed considerable variation in ownership and access to coastal waters/fisheries, and in the legal distinction between sport fishing and other recreational uses of marine fisheries and their commercial (catching for sale and profit) counterparts. Together with a re-examination of existing definitions, this has enabled us to suggest definitions that may be used to develop a common approach to evaluate participation and socio-economic value of marine recreational fishing, and guide attempts to legislate for the benefit and development of marine recreational fishing across Europe.

"Sampling, storage, and analysis of C-2-C-7 non-methane hydrocarbons from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Cooperative Air Sampling Network glass flasks","Pollmann, J; Helmig, D; Hueber, J; Plass-Dulmer, C; Tans, P","An analytical technique was developed to analyze light non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), including ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane, n-pentane, n-hexane, isoprene, benzene and toluene from whole air samples collected in 2.51-glass flasks used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division (NOAA ESRL GMD, Boulder, CO, USA) Cooperative Air Sampling Network. This method relies on utilizing the remaining air in these flasks (which is at below-ambient pressure at this stage) after the completion of all routine greenhouse gas measurements from these samples. NMHC in sample aliquots extracted from the flasks were preconcentrated with a custom-made, cryogen-free inlet system and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection (FID). C-2-C-7 NMHC, depending on their ambient air mixing ratios, could be measured with accuracy and repeatability errors of generally <= 10-20%. Larger deviations were found for ethene and propene. Hexane was systematically overestimated due to a chromatographic co-elution problem. Saturated NMHC showed less than 5% changes in their mixing ratios in glass flask samples that were stored for up to I year. In the same experiment ethene and propene increased at similar to 30% yr(-1). A series of blank experiments showed negligible contamination from the sampling process and from storage (<10 pptv yr(-1)) of samples in these glass flasks. Results from flask NMHC analyses were compared to in-situ NMHC measurements at the Global Atmospheric Watch station in Hohenpeissenberg, Germany. This 9-months side-by-side comparison showed good agreement between both methods. More than 94% of all data comparisons for C-2-C-5 alkanes, isoprene, benzene and toluene fell within the combined accuracy and precision objectives of the World Meteorological Organization Global Atmosphere Watch (WMO-GAW) for NMHC measurements.

Acanthosis Nigricans and insulin levels in a south Indian population-(ADEPS paper 2),"Menon, VU; Kumar, KV; Gilchrist, A; Sundaram, KR; Jayakumar, RV; Nair, V; Kumar, H","Objective: Aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of Acanthosis Nigricans (AN) in a central Kerala south Indian population and to evaluate its correlations with diabetes, obesity, insulin levels and other factors.Methods: A cross-sectional. community survey including physical examination and biochemical evaluation was conducted among adults above the age of 18 years in central Kerala In the first phase of the study 3069 participants were surveyed using questionnaires regarding socioeconomic status and medical details. Among them 986 subjects were evaluated in the second phase of the study which included anthropometric measurements, examination for blood pressure and Acanthosis Nigricans, blood tests such as blood glucose, fasting lipids. Fasting serum insulin level was measured for all non-diabetic subjects. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 11.0 version software.Results: Results of the study showed that 16.1% of population had AN and it was significantly higher among females (19.6%) than mates (11.4%). Prevalence of AN was highest in 30-40 year age group and it decreased with the age. Prevalence of AN correlated positively with female gender, obesity, high triglyceride levels and presence of diabetes. Presence of AN was significantly associated with higher fasting insulin levels. Mates with AN had significantly higher insulin values than females with AN.Conclusion: AN has stronger clinical relevance among mates than females and it can be used as a marker of insulin resistance in south Indian population especially if obesity and family history of diabetes are also present.

Alcohol consumption among recreational boaters: Factors for intervention,"Miller, JR; Pikora, TJ","Recreational boating is a popular leisure time activity in many countries. It is estimated that, in Australia, boating incidents cause more harm than rail and air crashes combined and, in terms of transport, are second only to motor vehicle crashes as a cause of serious injury. The consumption of alcohol among recreational boaters is considered an important risk factor for fatalities and injuries among both operators and passengers. Using a database of all recreational vessels registered in Western Australia (WA), a sample of 500 adult boaters was recruited to participate in a telephone survey. The effects of demographic variables and boating characteristics upon the use of alcohol among recreational boaters on their last trip were explored using logistic regression. The odds of not having a drink were associated, after adjusting for age, with having completed a boating education course and with carrying children less than 12 years on board. The use of alcohol was not found to be prevalent among WA recreational boat owners. Based on these findings, it is recommended that efforts to decrease boating-related incidents, such as through education and legislation measures, be monitored over time to determine the effects of these strategies upon safety behaviours.

The Cognitive and Attitudinal Effects of a Conservation Educational Module on Elementary School Students,"Dimopoulos, D; Paraskevopoulos, S; Pantis, JD","The ability of the National Marine Park of Zakynthos (NMPZ) in Greece to protect an important sea turtle rookery will ultimately depend on the level of local support and involvement that it receives. Therefore, it is essential for environmental educators to generate among local inhabitants, starting at early ages, positive attitudes concerning the NMPZ. The authors designed a conservation educational module, with 15 activities, to affect knowledge and attitudes of elementary school students. The authors used a quasi-experimental design for summative evaluation with a pretest-posttest control and experimental group to measure the effects on 4 dependent variables: (a) knowledge, (b) understanding and concern, (c) locus of control, and (d) verbal commitment. The survey instrument comprised 32 items that the authors divided into 4 subscales that measured the dependent variables. In total, 332 elementary school students-162 girls and 170 boys, 11-13 years of age-from 21 classes and 15 schools participated. The results indicated a significant effect on knowledge (low pretest scores), but not on attitudes (high pretest scores). However, posttest correlations in the experimental group indicated that as knowledge level increased, students' (a) locus of control and (b) understanding and concern for the sea turtle issue became more defensible. The study thus provides a model for environmental educators to design conservation education modules to foster positive attitudes in managing endangered species in protected areas.",2008,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION,39,3,47-61,WOS:000207742000004,10.3200/JOEE.39.3.47-61,,#20387,Dimopoulos 2008,,
A Comparison Between Modal Push-Over and Nonlinear Dynamic Response of Jacket Type Offshore Platforms Subjected to Strong Ground Motions,"ASME; Tavana, MAR; Asgarian, B","Nonlinear dynamic analysis for offshore structures has been a major challenge in marine structures and earthquake engineering. Nonlinear Dynamic Analysis of the structures Subjected to strong ground motions is the most reliable prediction method. This method is very complex and expensive. An alternative procedure that has found to be much applicable in recent years is the nonlinear static analysis called push-over analysis method. Many attempts have been made to improve the predictive capabilities of the push-over analysis, particularly by employing adaptive load patterns and accounting for higher modes of vibration effects through modal push-over.In this paper, modal push-over analysis (MPA) of jacket type offshore platforms considering soil-pile-structure interaction subjected to strong ground motion has been studied and the results have been compared with ""exact"" nonlinear response history analysis (NLRHA).A jacket type offshore platform includes of piles, jacket and deck with different behaviors during strong ground motion. In this paper, three-dimensional model of jacket and pile has been considered using a combination of finite element method (FEM) and beam on nonlinear winkler foundation (BNWF) approach in an integrated model. Both jacket and pile elements have been modeled using fiber sections.The model has been developed using Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSEES) software.In this paper, nonlinear seismic analysis of a new designed jacket type offshore platform located in Persian Gulf subjected to different levels of earthquake has been performed and the results have been compared with MPA ones.It can be concluded that the error percentage in MPA procedure is negligible when more modes of vibration are participated in the evaluation of the structure behavior.",2008,,"OMAE 2008: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 27TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OFFSHORE MECHANICS AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING - 2008, VOL 1",,,637-644,WOS:000263875900070,,,#20389,ASME 2008,,
Group behavior therapy versus individual behavior therapy for healthy dieting and weight control management in overweight and obese women living in rural community,"Waleekhachonloet, OA; Limwattananon, C; Limwattananon, S; Gross, CR","Objective: To compare group behavior therapy with individual behavior therapy for promoting healthy dieting behavior and weight control in overweight and obese women in rural community.Methods: This parallel group, open labeled, randomized non-inferiority trial was conducted from March 2005 to April 2006. A total of 132 overweight and obese women with a mean (S.D.) age of 38.4 (7.9) years and body mass index (BMI) of 28.9 (2.9) kg/m(2) were randomly assigned to receive either group behavior therapy (n = 65) or individual behavior therapy (n = 67). Five intervention sessions were provided biweekly during the 3-month period. Assessments were conducted at months 3, 6, and 12. Primary outcome was mean percentage weight toss at month 6. Other outcomes included anthropometric outcomes, dietary intake, healthy dieting behavior, intention, perceived behavioral control, attitude, and subjective norm.Results: Mean percentage weight toss at month 6 of group behavior therapy was comparable to individual behavior therapy (5.9% (95%Cl: 4.5-7.3) versus 5.4% (95%Cl: 4.0-6.7)); P = 0.027 for non-inferiority at one sided 0.05 Level of significance. Other outcomes were remarkably similar between the two study groups. Attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control improved slightly; whereas, intention, healthy dieting behavior, and dietary intake improved significantly after interventions. High intention and perceived behavioral control was related to greater weight toss. At 1 year, 73% of participants either lost or maintained their weight. Anthropometric outcomes and healthy dieting behavior were significantly better than baseline.Conclusions: Group behavior therapy was not inferior to individual behavior therapy, and it should be used as the first line mode of behavior therapy for weight control management in a rural community.

Survey of fish consumption patterns of King County (Washington) recreational anglers,"Mayfield, DB; Robinson, S; Simmonds, J","Three fish consumption surveys were conducted in King County, WA during 1997-2003. These surveys were conducted to support environmental analyses of proposed capital improvement projects planned by the King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks. Personal interviews were conducted at marine, estuarine, and freshwater locations throughout King County. Over 1300 anglers participated in the survey and provided consumption information. A majority of the respondents from the surveys (30-71%) were Caucasian, while the remaining respondents comprised various ethnic groups. The mean consumption rates for consumers of marine fish, shellfish, and freshwater fish were 53, 25, and 10 g/day, respectively. Results indicate that the consumption patterns of marine anglers from King County have remained consistent since the mid-1980s. The consumption distribution for marine anglers suggests that some respondents may consume fish as a large portion of their diet. The consumption habits of freshwater anglers are comparable to those of other recreational anglers throughout the United States.

Weight loss maintenance in women 3 years after following a 12-week structured weight loss program,"Cleanthous, X; Noakes, M; Keogh, JB; Mohr, P; Clifton, PM","Structured weight loss programs such as those using meal replacements are associated with both short-term and long-term weight loss, but the effectiveness of structured weight loss programs using whole foods has not been established. The primary aim of the present study was to retrospectively establish self-reported weight status in women, 3 years after participation in a 12-week food based structured weight loss program monitored by dietitians. The secondary aim was to determine which factors were associated with successful weight loss maintenance. Eighty-five of the 100 participants who completed the 12-week program participated in an 18-question telephone interview which included self-reported weight. Weight loss from baseline was 3.8 (S.D. 5.5) kg (4.4 (S. D. 6.1) %) (P<0.001). Overall, 61% of participants weighed less than at baseline, 13% had gained weight, and the remaining 26% had maintained their baseline weight. From baseline, 37 (44%) participants had a clinically important weight loss of >= 5%, and were, on average, 9.8 (S.D. 4.2) % lighter (P<0.001). The remaining 48 (56%) participants (weight loss < 5%) were not significantly different to their weight at baseline (P=0.77). We conclude that a food based structured weight loss program monitored by dietitians, as defined by this intervention, was associated with long-term weight loss maintenance.

Results from a randomized controlled trial comparing two low-calorie diet formulae,"Neovius, M; Rossner, S","Background: Very low and low-calorie diets ((V)LCD) are commonly used in the early phase of obesity treatment programmes. Recently, a new formula, Allevo (R), was introduced in Scandinavia. No study has hitherto assessed its efficacy compared to the commonly used (V)LCD Nutrilett (R).Objective: To compare Allevo (R) with Nutrilett (R) regarding short-term effects on weight and BMI loss, ketonaemia, compliance, and body composition.Design: Thirty-six males (baseline: age 46.5 +/- 10.9 year; BMI 39.2 +/- 3.8 kg/m(2); %BF 38.8 +/- 3.9%) participated in a randomized trial comparing two LCDs, differing mainly in protein and dietary fibre composition. Body composition was measured by DXA at baseline and end, while body weight was measured weekly during the 8-week (V) LCD-intervention. The main outcome measures were weight, BMI, waist-circumference (WC), and body fat percentage (%BF).Results: No significant differences between groups in age, weight, blood pressure, or %BF were observed at baseline (all p>0.3). The mean BMI change over the study period was -4.4 +/- 0.3 and -4.2 +/- 1.9 kg/m(2) for Nutrilett (R) and Allevo (R), respectively (p = 0.72), while WC was reduced by 9.6 +/- 1.0 and 10.1 +/- 3.2 cm, respectively (p=0.51). About 49% of the weight loss consisted of fat. When examining the weight development during the intervention, with the eight repeated measures, no significant difference in the slope of the weight loss curve could be detected (p=0.50-0.65). Ketonaemia developed similarly in both groups, and did not correlate to weight loss.Conclusion: Allevo (R) and Nutrilett (R) appear to have equivalent efficacy regarding weight, BMI, WC, and %BF loss in short-term interventions.

Participants were assessed for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, other psychological symptoms, perceptions of discrimination, perceptions of social support, evacuation distance, and the extent to which they experienced hurricane-related stressful events. Results were consistent with previous research on the impact of disasters on mental health symptoms. Findings extended research on individual differences in the response to trauma and indicated that regional context predicted unique variance in the experience of discrimination, social support, and emotional symptoms consistent with the theoretical model presented.

Monitoring the state of the Solent,"Conway, G","The development of the State of the Solent report and establishment of a set of coastal and marine indicators to measure the 'health' of the Solent was one of the original Flagship Projects developed when the Solent Forum was established in 1992. It was recognised that integrated coastal zone management requires robust indicators of sustainability that gauge the 'health' of the coast in relation to environmental, economic and social activity. The indicators selected for the Solent were, as far as possible, nested within established indicator sets that had been developed at the national and European levels. In developing the coastal sustainability indicators for the Solent and publishing the State of the Solent reports, a number of lessons were learned related to data compilation and the benefits of a participatory process to develop the indicators.

Deep sea immunity: Unveiling immune constituents from the hydrothermal vent mussel Bathymodiolus azoricus,"Bettencourt, R; Roch, P; Stefanni, S; Rosa, D; Colaco, A; Santos, RS","Marine molluscs are subjected to constant microbial threats in their natural habitats. As a result, they represent suitable models for the study of the molecular mechanisms that govern defense reactions in marine organisms. To understand humoral and cellular defense reactions in animals defying extreme physical and chemical conditions we set out to investigate the deep sea hydrothermal vent mussel Bathymodiolus azoricus found in abundance at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In the present study, hemocytes were stimulated with compounds of microbial origin and cellular morphological alterations as well as the production of superoxide assessed. Consequently, zymosan, glucan and peptidoglycan were considered as potent inducers of cellular reactions for inducing drastic cell morphology changes and high levels of superoxide production. Furthermore, we have presented for the first time in a deep sea hydrothermal vent animal, molecular evidence of the Rel-homology domain, a conserved motif present in all members of the Rel/nuclear-factor NF-KB family. Additionally we have demonstrated the occurrence of the antibacterial gene mytilin in Bathymodiolus azoricus gill tissues. Our results support the premise of an evolutionary conserved innate immune system in Bathymodiolus. Such system is seemingly homologous to that of Insects and other Bivalves and may involve the participation of NF-KB transcription factors and antibacterial genes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The results presented in this investigation are from 21 marine test sites only (no urban environments are included), distributed among I I countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Spain, Uruguay, Portugal and Venezuela). The environment was evaluated using ISO Standard 9223 and the concrete was characterized by measuring compressive strength, elastic modulus, total and effective porosity, chloride permeability according to ASTM standards, as well as the effective porosity and resistance to water absorption using the Fagerlund method. To that effect, concrete specimens (with and without reinforcement) were prepared for electrochemical and physical/mechanical/chemical tests using the existing materials in each participating country, following strict procedures which enabled the preparation of similar concrete samples. Two water/cement (w/c) ratios (0.45 and 0.65) were selected, where the concrete with 0.45 w/c ratio had to have a minimum cement content of 400 kg/m(3) and the one with 0.65 w/c ratio a compressive strength of 210 kg/cm(2). Type I Portland cement, siliceous sand, and crushed rock as coarse aggregates (13-mm maximum nominal size) were used. After a one-year exposure, the results of the corrosion potentiality and probability analysis of the reinforcement in the different test stations showed that, for marine atmospheres, the most aggressive environment to induce steel corrosion was at Portugal's Cabo Raso station, and the least aggressive one was at Chile's Valparaiso station. These results are comparable with the ones found using electrochemical measurements, after a two-year exposure. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Micro-evolution due to pollution: Possible consequences for ecosystem responses to toxic stress,"Medina, MH; Correa, JA; Barata, C","Polluting events can change community structure and ecosystem functioning. Selection of genetically inherited tolerance on exposed populations, here referred as micro-evolution due to pollution, has been recognized as one of the causes of these changes. However, there is a gap between studies addressing this process and those assessing effects at higher levels of biological organization. In this review we attempt to address these evolutionary considerations into the ecological risk assessment (ERA) of polluting events and to trigger the discussion about the consequences of this process for the ecosystem response to toxic stress. We provide clear evidence that pollution drives micro-evolutionary processes in several species. When this process occurs, populations inhabiting environments that become polluted may persist. However, due to the existence of ecological costs derived from the loss of genetic variability, negative pleiotropy with fitness traits and/or from physiological alterations, micro-evolution due to pollution may alter different properties of the affected populations. Despite the existence of empirical evidence showing that safety margins currently applied in the ERA process may account for pollution-induced genetic changes in tolerance, information regarding long-term ecological consequences at higher levels of biological organization due to ecological costs is not explicitly considered in these procedures. In relation to this, we present four testable hypotheses considering that micro-evolution due to pollution acts upon the variability of functional response traits of the exposed populations and generates changes on their functional effect traits, therefore, modifying the way species exploit their ecological niches and participate in the overall ecosystem functioning.

"Health effects of recreational exposure to Moreton Bay, Australia waters during a Lyngbya majuscula bloom","Osborne, NJ; Shaw, GR; Webb, PM","A survey of residents in an area subject to annual toxic cyanobacterial blooms was undertaken to examine potential health effects of cyanobacteria toxins. The survey assessed the health of marine recreational water users in Deception Bay/Bribie Island area in northern Moreton Bay, Queensland, which is exposed to blooms of the nuisance and potentially harmful cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. A postal survey was mailed to 5000 residents with a response rate of 27%. High numbers of people (78%) responding to the survey reported recreational water activity in Moreton Bay. Of those having marine recreational water activity, 34% reported at least one symptom after exposure to marine waters, with skin itching the most reported (23%). Younger participants had greater water exposure and symptoms than older participants. Participants with greater exposures were more likely to have skin and eye symptoms than less exposed groups, suggesting agents in the marine environment may have contributed to these symptoms. Of those entering Moreton Bay waters 29 (2.7%) reported severe skin symptoms, 12 of whom attended a health professional. Six (0.6%) reported the classic symptoms of recreational water exposure to L. majuscula, severe skin symptoms in the inguinal region. Participants with knowledge of L. majuscula were less likely to report less skin, gastrointestinal and fever and headache symptoms. In conclusion, high numbers of participants reported symptoms after exposure to waters subject to L. majuscula blooms but only a small number appeared to be serious in nature suggesting limited exposure to toxins.

Even though they are less common than ilmenite and magnetite (s.l.), there is strong field, experimental, and theoretical evidence that they are not geological oddities. Besides, pseudobrookite oxide solutions may have had a critical role in the petrogenesis of the mare basalts and lunar picritic glasses as a source of TiO2, and may be present in other planetary bodies as well. As materials they are of particular theoretical and practical interest because of the cation order-disordering phenomena that affect their physical and mechanical properties, and participation in the TiO2-slag smelting process.X-ray crystallography and spectroscopy studies have shown that all the cations are in octahedral coordination occupying two nonequivalent sites with a 1:2 ratio. Evaluation of site fractions, configurational entropy in R2(1-x)3+Rx2+Ti1+xO5 solutions, and of the known properties of pseudobrookite-group MgTi2O5 suggests that R23+TiO5 solutions may reach cation random distribution and thus entropy maxima at lower temperatures than R2+Ti2O5-rich solid solutions. As a result, the entropy contribution to their thermodynamic stability may depend upon the R2+/ R3+ ratio.On the basis of computations, experiments, and chemography of mineral equilibria it is inferred that (1) assemblages of pseudobrookite-group Ti oxide, ilmenite, rutile, olivine, and pyroxene(s) should be expected under lower crust and upper mantle conditions in the Earth, and, conceivably, in other planetary bodies including the Earth's Moon; (2) reactions between pseudobrookite-group, Ti oxide and olivine, orthopyroxene and pseudobrookite-group Ti oxide or ilmenite can produce ilmenite- or olivine-saturated Ti-enriched liquids; (3) lack of either ilmenite or pseudobrookite-group Ti oxide saturation in melts, which are in equilibrium with orthopyroxene and olivine enriches these melts in TiO2; (4) the assemblage olivine+orthopyroxene+rutile has a large stability field and is probably replaced by olivine+ orthopyroxene+ilmenite with increasing pressure and temperature, and olivine+orthopyroxene+pseudobrookite-group Ti oxide with decreasing pressure and increasing temperature; (5) lunar source regions, nominally saturated in olivine, orthopyroxene, and pseudobrookite-group Ti oxide or ilmenite may produce the range of TiO2 content in the lunar pristine glasses which, apparently, cannot be derived by partial melting of model late-stage Lunar Magma Ocean oxide+silicate assemblages or equivalent bulk compositions.

"Sustainable development in small island developing states: Agricultural intensification, economic development, and freshwater resources management on the coral atoll of Tongatapu","van der Velde, M; Green, SR; Vanclooster, M; Clothier, BE","Small island developing states (SIDS) are vulnerable due to their small size in both biophysical and socio-economic senses. They are increasingly confronted with the environmental consequences through utilisation of their fragile natural resources for economic development. Here we illustrate the dilemmas experienced by SIDS associated with sustainable economic development. Our focus is the main island of the Kingdom of Tonga, Tongatapu, located in the South Pacific Ocean. We analyse the intensification of agriculture and the attendant pressures on the islands freshwater resources. We combine environmental and economic data. Tongatapu (256 km(2)) is a raised coral atoll and the freshwater resources exist as lenses that float on top of denser salt water underneath the island. Since 1987 Tonga has exported squash pumpkin solely to Japan. Over the last 10 years, these exports have accounted for more then 40% of total export earnings, and represent 60% to 70% of GDP derived from agricultural export. This increase in exports is matched by an abrupt increase in the import and usage of agricultural chemicals. The island's freshwater lenses are increasingly under pressure from agricultural intensification. In the economic decision process, environmental impacts are not taken into account. This is partly because of overlapping institutional responsibilities of water management, and opaque institutional structures which are highlighted in the paper. The environmental consequences experienced by SIDS in terms of primary production stresses the need of taking natural capital into account when the benefits from international trade are evaluated. At the same time pollution will result in irrecoverable losses in terms of tourist potential. Improved agricultural practices have to be implemented through educational tools to ensure continuing economic prosperity derived from agricultural exports. Economic development of SIDS should also focus on the maintenance of kin relationships overseas, securing rent incomes and regional cooperative development efforts. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A step toward data assimilation in solar wind research,"Merka, J; Merkova, D; Odstrcil, D","Data assimilation is routinely performed for meteorological or oceanographic observations but largely unknown in heliospheric physics. Therefore, this paper will introduce basic concepts of data assimilation methods and their potential benefits to solar wind research. A data assimilation method generally employs multiple data sources and a numerical model in order to provide an accurate global description of the studied environment. This necessitates a very close cooperation between both instrumentalists and modelers because careful understanding (error analysis) of both input and simulated data is required for accurate results. As a particular example of data assimilation in heliospheric research, the paper presents a concept of a newly started project that aims to resolve the transverse solar wind profile at 1 AU from multiple solar wind monitors and the 3D solar wind numerical model ENLIL. When finished, the method will not only provide input data for magnetospheric studies but it will be also extendable to larger heliospheric scales provided that enough data sources exist.

New methodology is applied to the rich store of quantitative and qualitative data that is already available, and shows the richness of analysis and understanding that can be derived.

On the mobility and potential retention of iodine in the Callovian-Oxfordian formation,"Tournassat, C; Gaucher, EC; Fattahi, M; Grambow, B","Iodide sorption experiments were conducted on clay stone samples originating from the Callovian-Oxfordian formation under experimental conditions as close as possible to in situ conditions. The total natural iodine content of the formation is shown to be very constant throughout the formation, ranging from 2 to 3 ppm. This range is in agreement with a past iodine accumulation in the marine organic matter of the sediment before and during deposition, and early diagenesis. At variance with total iodine, the leached iodine concentrations are variable. If leached iodine is considered to represent porewater solute iodine, its concentration can be calculated and ranges from 0 (below detection limit) to similar to 60 mu mol/L and represents 0-25% of the total iodine. The reason for this variability is not understood. Sorption isotherms were determined either for natural I-127(-) solutions or for I-131(-) spiked I-127(-) solutions, with concentrations ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-3) mol/L at solid to liquid ratios from 10 to 200 g/L. No or little sorption was encountered, K-d values being in the range 0-0.5 L/kg with statistical and analytical error bands being greater than the K-d values, with the exception of one experiment at low solid to liquid ratio (10 g/L), showing significant K-d values of similar to 25 L/kg. In sorption experiments with natural I-127(-) and at the lowest added iodide concentrations (<10(-6) mol/L) an apparent negative K-d was obtained due to the iodide content in the solid porewater that was leached once the solid was suspended. The low affinity of iodide for argilite is thus confirmed. However, based only on these results and given the extent of the error bands, one cannot discard a limited iodide uptake. Literature data on iodide diffusion on similar rock materials have already shown that iodide does not behave like chloride. The retention mechanism of radio-iodide is discussed in the light of the present results and diffusion data. A model involving isotopic exchange between the natural iodine content of the geological formation and radio-iodine allows all of the results to be described. Not all the iodine in the formation appears to participate in isotopic exchange reactions with the solution. A quantification of the isotopically labile fraction of iodine would allow the effect of isotopic exchange on radio-iodide migration throughout the Callovian-Oxfordian formation to be assessed and predicted.

Oceanic implications for climate change policy,"McNeil, BI","Under the United Nations convention on the law of the sea (1982), each participating country maintains exclusive economic and environmental rights within the oceanic region extending 200 nm from its territorial sea, known as the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Although the ocean within each EEZ is undoubtedly an anthropogenic CO2 sink, it has been overlooked within international climate policy. In this paper I use an area-weighted scaling argument to show that the inclusion of the EEZ CO2 sink within national carbon accounts would have significant implications in tracking national greenhouse commitments to any future climate change policy initiative. The advantages and disadvantages for inclusion of the EEZ CO2 sink into global climate change policy are also explored. The most compelling argument for including the EEZ CO2 sink is that it would enhance the equity and resources among coastal nations to combat and adapt against future climate change that will inherently impact coastal nations more so than land locked nations. If included, the funds raised could be used for either monitoring or adaptive coastal infrastructure among the most vulnerable nations. On the other hand, the EEZ anthropogenic CO2 sink cannot be directly controlled by human activities and could be used as a disincentive for some developed nations to reduce fossil-fuel related greenhouse gas emissions. This may therefore dampen efforts to ultimately reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. In consideration of these arguments it is therefore suggested that an ""EEZ clause"" be added to Kyoto and any future international climate policy that explicitly excludes its use within national carbon accounts under these international climate frameworks.

Implementing the WSSD decision of restoring marine ecosystems by 2015 - scientific information support in the public domain,"Nauen, CE","Among the relatively few decisions taken by heads of States and government at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in September 2002 in Johannesburg, South Africa, was the time-bound objective to restore degraded stocks to productive levels in its Plan of Implementation. The paper examines the evidence leading to this decision and the broadening of cognitive maps it implies. In particular, it documents how public archiving of research results and other knowledge sources particularly those accessible through the Fish Base (www.fishbase.org) and Sea Around Us (www.seaaroundus.org) websites has been effective in enabling citizens in addition to specialist publics to counteract shifting baselines and monitor progress against the WSSD plan. The increased targeting and cost-effectiveness of research efforts and the social benefits of public research spending this implies militates for the extension of such approaches to other groups as an enabling mechanism for WSSD decisions on restoring marine ecosystems by 2015.

Interactions between striped bass (Morone saxatilis) rebuilding programmes and the conservation of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and other anadromous fish species in the USA,"Grout, DE","Anadromous populations of striped bass occur along the Atlantic coast of the US from Maine to North Carolina. Recruitment over fishing and declining water quality led to substantial reductions in striped bass abundance during the 1970s and 1980s. Cooperative interstate fishery management of striped bass began in 198 1, with the development of a fishery management plan by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an organization of Atlantic coastal states. Effective fishery management and additional research and monitoring contributed to a tenfold increase in abundance of striped bass stocks by the late 1990s. This dramatic increase resulted in increased predation on a variety of anadromous fish species including American shad, blueback herring, and alewives. Predation by striped bass on Atlantic salmon smolts in North America has been documented, but the impact of this predation has not been quantified. Moderate to strong correlations were found between estimates of striped bass abundance and the return of Atlantic salmon to three of the four major New England salmon rivers. Further research is required to quantify the proportion of smolt production consumed by striped bass, particularly for salmon populations listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act.

An overview of the BEEP Stavanger workshop,"Pampanin, DM; Viarengo, A; Garrigues, P; Andersen, OK","Within the three-year European Research Project BEEP (Biological Effects of Environmental Pollution in marine ecosystems), a workshop was carried out at the facility of Akvamiljo a.s. with the scientific support of IRIS (International Research Institute of Stavanger) researchers. Validation of newly developed biomarkers, especially at the molecular level, was the core part of the activity.Two large scale mesocosm exposures were done and samples shared between the participants (about 30 Institute), allowing an integrated approach for studying the effects of several pollutants selected as environmentally important issues (i.e. PAHs, alkyl phenols, bisphenol A, diallyl phthalate and polybrominated diphenyl ether). In addition, a field study (Visne,. Norway) has been performed for the validations of biomarkers under environmental conditions.The Stavanger workshop demonstrates the importance of collaboration between researchers to establish common ways to proceed in biomarker analysis. The common exposures encourage a joint strategy for planning biomonitoring activity. A clarification in this direction is needed to coordinate results from numerous studies about the environmental impact of pollutants which are currently carried out all over Europe and around the world. Expertise in various disciplines is required to plan and perform a successful monitoring activity and to study/predict the effect of environmental pollutants. Biologists, chemists, statisticians and environmental researchers should always be included.The Stavanger workshop also indicated the importance of developing multivariate statistical methods to enable interpretation of complex data sets. It is of interest to develop statistical tools which can integrate the results from a battery of biomarkers in order to obtain a more complete picture of environmental impact.

Uncoupling of cytochrome P450 1A and stimulation of reactive oxygen species production by co-planar polychlorinated biphenyl congeners,"Schlezinger, JJ; Struntz, WDJ; Goldstone, JV; Stegeman, JJ","The non-ortho-polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener 3,3'4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 77) can uncouple the catalytic cycle of fish (scup) cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) and mammalian (rat, human) CYP1A1, stimulating release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). PCB 77 also inactivates CYP1A in an NADPH-, oxygen-, and time-dependent process, linked to uncoupling. We addressed a hypothesis that planar halogenated hydrocarbons generally will uncouple CYP1A. Thus, additional PCB congeners including non-ortho-3,3',4,4',5'-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) and 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 169), mono-ortho-2,3,3',4,4'-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 105) and di-ortho-2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 52), as well as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), were examined for their ability to stimulate microsomal ROS production and to inactivate CYP1A. Incubated without NADPH, non-ortho-PCB 126 and -PCB 169 both inhibited microsomal CYP1A activity (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase; EROD). When NADPH was included, these congeners caused a progressive inactivation of CYP1A, in addition to the inhibition. The determined K-Inact values for inactivation were 0.14 and 0.08 mu M, respectively, for PCB 126 and PCB 169, similar to the 0.05 mu M for PCB 77 previously reported. The mono-ortho-PCB 105 weakly inhibited and weakly inactivated CYP1A. The di-ortho-PCB 52 neither inhibited nor inactivated CYP1A. Alone, B[a]P strongly inhibited CYP1A, but when NADPH was added that inhibition was reversed, apparently by metabolic depletion of the substrate, and there was no inactivation. PCB 126 and PCB 169 stimulated release of ROS from induced liver microsomes, while B[a]P, PCB 52 and PCB 105 did not. ROS release and CYP1A inactivation stimulated by the non-ortho-PCB 126 and PCB 169 indicate an uncoupling of CYP1A like that previously shown with PCB 77. The uncoupling and release of ROS further suggest a participation of CYP1A in the oxidative stress associated with some planar halogenated aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A community-wide intercomparison exercise for the determination of dissolved iron in seawater,"Bowie, AR; Achterberg, EP; Croot, PL; de Baar, HJW; Laan, P; Moffett, JW; Ussher, S; Worsfold, PJ","The first large-scale international intercomparison of analytical methods for the determination of dissolved iron in seawater was carried out between October 2000 and December 2002. The exercise was conducted as a rigorously ""blind"" comparison of 7 analytical techniques by 24 international laboratories. The comparison was based on a large volume (700 L), filtered surface seawater sample collected from the South Atlantic Ocean (the ""IRONAGES"" sample), which was acidified, mixed and bottled at sea. Two 1-L sample bottles were sent to each participant. Integrity and blindness were achieved by having the experiment designed and carried out by a small team, and overseen by an independent data manager. Storage, homogeneity and time-series stability experiments conducted over 2.5 years showed that inter-bottle variability of the IRONAGES sample was good (< 7%), although there was a decrease in iron concentration in the bottles over time (0.8-0.5 nM) before a stable value was observed. This raises questions over the suitability of sample acidification and storage.For the complete dataset of 45 results (after excluding 3 outliers not passing the screening criteria), the mean concentration of dissolved iron in the IRONAGES sample was 0.59 +/- 0.21 nM, representing a coefficient of variation (%CV) for analytical comparability (""community precision"") of 36% (1s), a significant improvement over earlier exercises. Within-run precision (5-10%), inter-run precision (15%) and inter-bottle homogeneity (< 7%) were much better than overall analytical comparability, implying the presence of: (1) random variability (inherent to all intercomparison exercises); (2) errors in quantification of the analytical blank; and (3) systematic inter-method variability, perhaps related to secondary sample treatment (e.g. measurement of different physicochemical fractions of iron present in seawater) in the community dataset. By grouping all results for the same method, analyses performed using flow injection-luminol chemiluminescence (with Fell detection after sample reduction) [Bowie, A.R., Achterberg, E.P., Mantoura, R.F.C., Worsfold, P.J., 1998.

Rather it summarises the status of dissolved iron analysis in seawater by the international community at the start of the 21st century, and can be used to inform future exercises including the SAFE iron intercomparison study in the North Pacific in October 2004.

Early muddy deposits along the Gulf of Lions shoreline: A key for a better understanding of land-to-sea transfer of sediments and associated pollutant fluxes,"Roussiez, V; Aloisi, JC; Monaco, A; Ludwig, W","Large quantities of sediment introduced by rivers especially during flood events lead to the formation of prodeltaic structures characterized by fine-grained deposits in the proximal area of the shelf. According to their mean grain size, it is largely admitted in the literature that these deposits mainly stand below the storm wave base. In the Gulf of Lions (NW Mediterranean), however, our data show that these muddy sediments also exist above the storm wave limit, in the uppermost unit of the Holocene prism. The purpose of this work is therefore to draw a detailed sedimentological and geochemical portrait of these units, and to discuss the processes involved in the sedimentation and remobilization of these sediments. Our results show that the fine particles accumulate earlier in the inner-shelf in front of the nearby rivers, in association with the chemical elements which are commonly associated with this gain size fraction (e.g. organic carbon, radionuclides, and heavy metals). This accumulation probably mainly occurs during storm and flood events. The early deposits are then exposed to resuspension events and can actively participate to the distribution of fine-grained sediment in the entire margin by advective transfers via the benthic nepheloid layer. These fine-grained nearshore prodeltas are a common feature of the Mediterranean deltaic systems and mark the frontal processes that occur at the continent/sea interface of non-tidal seas. Our results especially point out the potential use of heavy metals as markers of the tracking of riverine sediments, which is naturally an important condition when evaluating the ultimate fate of land-derived pollutants in the marine realm. But also more fundamental studies on the understanding of sedimentological processes and reconstruction of margin stratigraphies should consider these deposits as functional units for the distribution of platform sediments.

Satellite instrument calibration for measuring global climate change - Report of a Workshop,"Ohring, G; Wielicki, B; Spencer, R; Emery, B; Datla, R","Measuring the small changes associated with long-term global climate change from space is a daunting task.

To address these problems and recommend directions for improvements in satellite instrument calibration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System-Integrated Program Office (NPOESS-IPO), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) organized a workshop at the University of Maryland Inn and Conference Center, College Park, Maryland, 12-14 November 2002. Some 75 scientists participated including researchers who develop and analyze long-term datasets from satellites; experts in the field of satellite instrument calibration, and physicists working on state-of-the-art calibration sources and standards. The workshop defined the absolute accuracies and long-term stabilities of global climate datasets that are needed to detect expected trends, translated these dataset accuracies and stabilities to required satellite instrument accuracies and stabilities, and evaluated the ability of current observing systems to meet these requirements.The workshop's recommendations include a set of basic axioms or overarching principles that must guide high quality climate observations in general, and a road map for improving satellite instrument characterization, calibration, intercalibration, and associated activities to meet the challenge of measuring global climate change.

Lobster and conch fisheries of Belize: a history of sequential exploitation,"Huitric, M","This article presents a historical review of the lobster and conch fisheries in Belize, Central America. In terms of yield and value, these are the main wild-caught targets of the national fisheries, a small-scale commercial fishery of around 3000 fishermen. Data were collected during interviews with key informants involved with the fisheries and through literature and archive research. The goal was to study how the fishing industry has responded to environmental signals from these resources and from their ecosystems and ecosystem dynamics. National yields for both lobster and conch have been relatively stable, however, individuals' yields have been declining despite increased effort since the 1980s. This study concludes that the use of fossil fuel-based technology and organizational change, with the establishment of fishermen's cooperatives, have masked environmental signals. This masking, together with economic incentives, has led to the ""pathology of resource use."" As a symptom of this pathology, four forms of sequential exploitation in these fisheries were identified. A major conclusion is that social resilience may not confer ecological resilience. The development of the cooperatives was needed in order to improve equity in the industry. Before their impacts could be assessed, this organizational change, together with new technology, led to very important and rapid changes in the industry. Together with existing regulations that allow de facto open access to lobster and conch, these changes resulted in a short-term boom that has resulted in the pathology of resource use, with over-capitalization and dependence on maintained yields, regardless of environmental feedback.",2005,,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,10,1,,WOS:000230237900009,,,#20420,Huitric 2005,,
The recreational fishery off Majorca Island (western Mediterranean): some implications for coastal resource management,"Morales-Nin, B; Moranta, J; Garcia, C; Tugores, MP; Grau, AM; Riera, F; Cerda, M","The sociology and habits of recreational anglers on the Island of Majorca (western Mediterranean) were evaluated using telephone and on-site surveys, as well as fishing logbooks and recreational fishing competitions. The recreational fishery is one of the island's main leisure activities, 5.14% of the population (37265 people) participating. Enthusiasts tend to be mainly middle class (most anglers own boats moored at marinas), middle-aged males (90% male, mean age 46 +/- 2 years). The most popular fishing method is from a boat (62.9%), followed by fishing from shore (32.4%), and spearfishing (3.6%). The mean time spent fishing is 3.86 +/- 0.03 h d(-1), and more than one type of gear (mean 1.27 +/- 0.21) is used simultaneously by a single angler. The frequency of fishing is 4-6 times per month, mainly on holidays and weekends, increasing in summer. The activity has a sizeable impact on the coastal fauna, with diverse catches of at least 1209.25 t year(-1) (about 615 000 fishing outings year(-1)). Thus, the amount of carbon extracted annually is at least 137.34 kg C km(-2) year(-1), and the recreational fishery removes about 31% of production at trophic level 4. Although these are gross estimates and more detailed study of the effect on trophic level and local production is needed, the values do highlight the pressure the recreational fishery exerts on coastal fish communities. Assuming that this level of exploitation is common to north-shore Mediterranean countries, there may be cause for concern about sustainable exploitation in the recreational fishery, and the effectiveness of current protection measures is discussed. Despite the limitations of the study, recreational fisheries clearly should be taken into account when considering measures for fisheries management. Moreover, fishing has considerable social import, and the benefits must be taken into account when investments to protect exploited resources are being contemplated.

Among participants who had no history of STIs or pregnancy, but who engaged in risky sexual behaviors just before recruit training, the control group was more likely to acquire a postintervention STI (OR 3.24, CI = 1.74-6.03). Among participants who were not sexually experienced at baseline, the control group was more likely to have casual (OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.04-4.08) and multiple (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.01-3.47) sexual partners postintervention.Conclusions. This randomized controlled trial indicates that cognitive-behavioral interventions are effective for reducing behavioral risk and preventing STIs and UPs in young, sexually active women who are not seeking health care.

Estimating glacial western Pacific sea-surface temperature: methodological overview and data compilation of surface sediment planktic foraminifer faunas,"Chen, MT; Huang, CC; Pflaumann, U; Waelbroeck, C; Kucera, M","We present a detailed comparison of five ""transfer function"" techniques calibrated to reconstruct sea-surface temperature (SST) from planktic foraminifer counts in western Pacific surface sediments. The techniques include the Imbrie-Kipp method (IKM), modern analog technique (MAT), modern analog technique with similarity index (SIMMAX), revised analog method (RAM), and the artificial neural network technique (ANN). The calibration is based on a new database of 694 census counts of planktic foraminifers in coretop samples from the western Pacific, compiled under a cooperative effort within the MARGO (multiproxy approach for the reconstruction of the glacial ocean surface) project. All five techniques were used to reconstruct SST variation in a well-dated Holocene to last glacial maximum interval in core MD972151 from the southern South China Sea (SCS) to evaluate the magnitude of cooling in the western tropical Pacific during the LGM. Our results suggest that MAT, SIMMAX, RAM and ANN show a similar level of performance in SST estimation and produce <= 1 degrees C uncertainties in coretop SST calibrations of the western Pacific. When applying these techniques to the downcore faunal record, the IKM, which performed significantly worst in the calibration exercise, produced glacial SST estimates similar to present-day values, whereas the other four techniques all indicated similar to 1 degrees C cooler glacial SST. Because of their better performance in the calibration dataset, and because of the convergence among the techniques in the estimated magnitude of glacial cooling in the studied core, we conclude that MAT, SIMMAX, RAM and ANN provide more robust planktic foraminifer paleo-SST estimates than traditional IKM techniques in western Pacific paleoceanographic studies.

Underwater interpretative trail: guidance to improve education and decrease ecological damage,"Berchez, F; Carvalhal, F; Robim, MD","Studies of environmental education on trails in the sea and their impact are scarce, especially as regards the Brazilian coast. Herein is analysed an implemented model of an interpretative guided underwater trail (free diving), undertaken in the Anchieta Island's Park, southeast Brazil. The activity consisted of a preparatory lecture, followed by a 350 m trail along the rocky shore. The results therefrom were evaluated through the application of questionnaires and by tabulation of the visitor's behaviour and impact. A high degree of satisfaction with the activity (average mark = 2.7, maximum 3) was recorded. Even though initial expectations of the participants were related to the dive (36%), the main aspect pointed out afterwards was the educational experience within the marine environment (71%).

"Getting closer to whales - passenger expectations and experiences, and the management of swim with dwarf minke whale interactions in the Great Barrier Reef","Valentine, PS; Birtles, A; Curnock, M; Arnold, P; Dunstan, A","Whale-watching tourism is a growth industry worldwide. In Australia, with whale-watchers approaching one million per annum there has been considerable effort to develop management regimes that protect the whales while enabling the development of a sustainable ecotourism industry. A mixture of National and State laws and regulations have governed the industry (Tourism based on free-ranging marine wildlife: opportunities and responsibilities, Wildlife Tourism Research Report No. 11, Status Assessment of Wildlife Tourism in Australia Series, CRC for Sustainable Tourism, Gold Coast, Queensland) but these have been mainly derived from experiences with humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whale watching from vessels at sea. In this article we describe the development and nature of new and rapidly growing swim-with-whales operations based on the dwarf minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in the Great Barrier Reef of northern Queensland. The distinctly different quality of these operations raise interesting questions for long-term management (Towards sustainable management of the developing dwarf minke whale tourism industry in northern Queensland, CRC Reef Research Technical Report 27, James Cook University of North Queensland, 30pp (emended version of SC/50/WW1)).In the 1999-2000 seasons, 453 passengers (88.1% of respondents) swam with minke whales. Only 25% of visitors came specifically for the whale interactions and 43% learned of the whales on board the vessel. Passengers thus had low expectations about whales and encounters. A variety of factors, including the diving experience, particular dive sites, a range of wildlife species and socializing contributed to visitor satisfaction. Nonetheless, there was a significant correlation between visitor satisfaction and closeness of approaches by the whales, total number of whales seen and total time spent with whales. We discuss the key issues associated with swim-with-whales programs in the light of our findings. The cooperative engagement of tourism operators, researchers and government management agencies is a feature of this new industry. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Eradication success down under: heat treatment of a sunken trawler to kill the invasive seaweed Undaria pinnatifida,"Wotton, DM; O'Brien, C; Stuart, MD; Fergus, DJ","Eradication of invasive species is difficult in the marine environment, and there have only been a few successes. We report the successful eradication of the invasive seaweed Undaria pinnatifida from a sunken trawler in the Chatham Islands, New Zealand. New heat-treatment methods were developed as the most cost effective and environmentally acceptable option to kill Undaria. Monitoring of the trawler for three years after it sank found no Undaria after the vessel was treated. Key factors in the success of the eradication programme included: early detection, a rapid response, pre-existing knowledge of Undaria, an adaptive management approach, targeting of multiple life history stages, and the cooperation of the vessel's insurer.

World-wide comparison on the quality of analytical determinations of PCDDs/PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs in food,"Becher, G; Haug, LS; Thomsen, C","Interlaboratory comparsion exercises on the determination of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDDs/PCDFs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in three natural foodstuffs have been performed annually since 2000 by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Up to 77 laboratories from 24 countries world-wide have reported results. The data have been statistically analysed in order to assess the comparability of both the reported individual congener concentrations and the calculated toxic equivalents (TEQ). Due to the low concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs in food, the treatment of congeners reported as ""not detected"" and the identification of outliers, influence the estimation of the consensus values considerably. Based on the experiences from the first two rounds, an approach for calculation of the consensus values was established, resulting in a non-skewed distribution of data. The relative standard deviation of consensus TEQs was 13-32% for PCDDs/PCDFs and 11-45% for PCBs. Z-scores were calculated for PCDD/PCDF-TEQs using a target value of +/-20% for the deviation. For food samples with a PCDD/PCDF contamination of more than half of the EU maximum level, 63-87% of the participants achieved Z-scores +/-1, while for low contaminated foodstuffs about 60% of the participants had Z-scores of +/-2. After four rounds of interlaboratory comparisons it can be concluded that there is a good comparability of the analytical data for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in food at higher contamination levels. However, the laboratories need to improve their performance when determining levels in food with low contamination of dioxin-like compounds, due to the increasing demand for analyses of such food items. The importance of determining dioxin-like PCBs is demonstrated by their large contribution to the total TEQ, especially in food from the marine environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluation of OCMIP-2 ocean models' deep circulation with mantle helium-3,"Dutay, JC; Jean-Baptiste, P; Campin, JM; Ishida, A; Maier-Reimer, E; Matear, RJ; Mouchet, A; Totterdell, IJ; Yamanaka, Y; Rodgers, K; Madec, G; Orr, JC","We compare simulations of the injection of mantle helium-3 into the deep ocean from six global coarse resolution models which participated in the Ocean Carbon Model Intercomparison Project (OCMIP). We also discuss the results of a study carried out with one of the models, which examines the effect of the subgrid-scale mixing parameterization. These sensitivity tests provide useful information to interpret the differences among the OCMIP models and between model simulations and the data.We find that the OCMIP models, which parameterize subgrid-scale mixing using an eddy-induced velocity, tend to underestimate the ventilation of the deep ocean, based on diagnostics with delta(3)He. In these models, this parameterization is implemented with a constant thickness diffusivity coefficient. In future simulations, we recommend using such a parameterization with spatially and temporally varying coefficients in order to moderate its effect on stratification. The performance of the models with regard to the formation of AABW confirms the conclusion from a previous evaluation with CFC-11. Models coupled with a sea-ice model produce a substantial bottom water formation in the Southern Ocean that tends to overestimate AABW ventilation, while models that are not coupled with a sea-ice model systematically underestimate the formation of AABWWe also analyze specific features of the deep He-3 distribution (He-3 plumes) that are particularly well depicted in the data and which put severe constraints on the deep circulation. We show that all the models fail to reproduce a correct propagation of these plumes in the deep ocean. The resolution of the models may be too coarse to reproduce the strong and narrow currents in the deep ocean., and the models do not incorporate the geothermal heating that may also contribute to the generation of these currents. We also use the context of OCMIP-2 to explore the potential of mantle helium-3 as a tool to compare and evaluate modeled deep-ocean circulations. Although the source function of mantle helium is known with a rather large uncertainty, we find that the parameterization used for the injection of mantle helium-3 is sufficient to generate realistic results, even in the Atlantic Ocean where a previous pioneering study [J. Geophys. Res. 100 (1995) 3829] claimed this parameterization generates inadequate results. These results are supported by a multi-tracer evaluation performed by considering the simulated distributions of both helium-3 and natural C-14, and comparing the simulated tracer fields with available data.

A direct instrument comparison for measurement of total dissolved nitrogen in seawater,"Sharp, JH; Beuregard, AY; Burdige, D; Cauwet, G; Curless, SE; Lauck, R; Nagel, K; Ogawa, H; Parker, AE; Primm, O; Pujo-Pay, A; Savidge, WB; Seitzinger, S; Spyres, G; Styles, R","A direct comparison has been made for the measurement of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in seawater using high temperature combustion (HTC) instruments. A side-by-side comparison in one laboratory (Lewes exercise) was made with two hybrid total organic carbon (TOC) instruments linked to chemiluminescence detectors (CLD), a combined TOC total nitrogen (TN) instrument, and two stand-alone TN instruments. Later, a series of field samples was run in home laboratories of the participants (Homelab exercise) using four hybrid TOC-CLD systems, the combined TOC/TN instrument, and three stand-alone TN instruments. In the Lewes and Homelab exercises, samples were also run by the more established persulfate oxidation method. There was fairly good agreement (group precision) among all the HTC methods; average %CV of +/-12.0% for five nitrogen compounds and average %CV of +/-7.7% for five natural samples in the Lewes exercise and %CV of +/-10.7% for 14 field samples in the Homelab exercise. In both cases, the persulfate method values were similar to those of the HTC instruments.On a finer scale of evaluation, the stand-alone TN instruments, operating at higher combustion temperatures, gave considerably more scatter and more divergent values than the set of HTC instruments that used a singular combustion environment with a lower temperature. The five hybrid systems, with Shimadzu TOC instruments combined with five different CLD systems and employing individual integration programs, gave a group precision of +/-5.8% for the field samples. These systems also provided simultaneous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, and the DOC group precision for the 14 samples was +/-5.9%. Our conclusion is that the five Shimadzu instrument systems provide more accurate TDN measurements than the stand-alone instruments. However, when subtracting inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to calculate dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), there is not good agreement, especially for deep ocean samples. The persulfate method gave slightly higher TDN concentrations for the field samples than the Shimadzu HTC averages, indicating a possibility of incomplete conversion of some nitrogen compounds by the HTC instruments and/or peak integration problems. The inequity with persulfate oxidation and the scatter with the HTC methods require further investigation. A new broad community DON comparison is currently underway which includes TDN and DIN analyses. In addition, several of us are informally collaborating to improve and evaluate routine analysis with HTC instrumentation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Management of aquaculture effluents workshop discussion summary,"O'Bryen, PJ; Lee, CS","Aquaculture effluents should be monitored and managed, to avoid or reduce any negative environmental impacts. Monitoring fulfills two separate functions: (a) to establish environmental standards and practices that will protect the surrounding environment, and (b) to ensure compliance with regulations. Management of aquaculture discharges can be achieved by technical solutions and regulations. A workshop, ""Management of Aquaculture Effluents"", attended by international experts in effluent policy development and technical management was organized by The Oceanic Institute in Hawaii. This paper provides a summary of some of the main issues involved in policy development and management of effluents that were discussed as well as the conclusions that were reached at this workshop. Participants discussed policies in effect in different countries, the problems encountered in compliance, and economic implications. Management issues they discussed included the importance of setting goals and of collecting relevant data, taking into consideration the diversity of culture systems and the receiving environment.

Correlation between the presence of Gonyaulax fragilis (Dinophyceae) and the mucilage phenomena of the Emilia-Romagna coast (northern Adriatic Sea),"Pompei, M; Mazziotti, C; Guerrini, F; Cangini, M; Pigozzi, S; Benzi, M; Palamidesi, S; Boni, L; Pistocchi, R","The formation of massive amounts of suspended mucilaginous organic matter which periodically affects the Adriatic Sea, has been regarded as a complex physico-chemical phenomenon resulting from the production of extracellular material by phytoplankton. Although the exact cause has remained obscure, the mechanism of its formation has usually been considered to be a long-term process, starting after the late winter-early spring blooms, and involving the participation of various algal species, mainly within the diatom group. In this paper we report on the results of a phytoplankton monitoring programme in northern Adriatic seawaters off the Emilia-Romagna coast of Italy which revealed the constant concomitant presence of the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax fragilis (Schutt) Kofoid and mucilaginous formations. In the early stages of the phenomenon the dinoflagellate was clearly observable by microscopic examination in the mucilage, but as the mucilage aged this alga almost completely decomposed and diatom cells increased in number and became predominant. Although characterized by a slow growth rate in culture, in natural seawater G. fragilis was observed to reach cell densities of up to 7.0 x 10(6) cells l(-1). The results of this study lead us to propose the hypothesis that the appearance of mucilage in the water column of the Adriatic Sea is the consequence of a seasonal growth of this dinoflagellate favoured by specific environmental circumstances.

Time series of long-term annual fluxes in the streamwater of nine forest catchments from the Swedish environmental monitoring program (PMK 5),"Folster, J; Bishop, K; Kram, P; Kvarnas, H; Wilander, A","international cooperation has contributed to major declines in SO2 emission and S deposition during the last two decades in Europe. The chemical recovery from already anthropogenically acidified sites however, has been slow. In the present paper, long-term trends of chemical fluxes from nine selected forested reference catchments were studied, to detect recovery from acidification and leaching of S and base cations (BC). A decline in S deposition resulted in a decreased flux of non-marine sulfate (SO4*) in seven of nine streams, with statistically significant changes in four. The two cases with slight increases in SO4* flux resulted from increasing water flow. The SO4* decrease was followed by a recovery from acidification in terms of increased ANC flux in those sites in southern Sweden that were chronically acidified. The recovery was probably slowed down by leaching of SO4 from the soil and a decrease in the flux of BC. A better understanding of the processes for leaching of SO4 and BC is needed in order to quantify the need for further restrictions of sulfur emissions to allow a long term recovery of acidified catchments. The flux calculations available from small catchments such as those in this study, are of value for that understanding. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

"The cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, is a key organism for reef fish diversity at Ras Mohammed National Park, Egypt","Bshary, R","1. In marine cleaning symbioses, small fish or shrimps remove ectoparasites and other material from cooperating 'client' fish. Until now, there has been conflicting evidence with respect to the importance of cleaning for client health and in particular with respect to the impact of cleaning organisms on local fish diversity.2. Data are provided on the impact of the cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus on reef fish distribution at Ras Mohammed National Park, Egypt. During four field seasons, I regularly sampled fish species composition in 46 reef patches. Natural fluctuations in cleaner fish presence or absence at these reef patches allowed me to assess how this variable correlates with reef fish diversity. In addition, cleaner fish were removed experimentally from some reef patches and added at others to test whether the presence or absence of cleaner fish causes changes in fish diversity.3. Both cleaner fish disappearance and cleaner fish removal had no immediate effects on fish abundance, i.e. within the first few weeks. A significant decline in fish diversity was only detectable after 4-20 months.4. In contrast, cleaner immigration or experimental addition led to a significant increase in fish diversity within the first few weeks.5. Generally, effects were most pronounced for client species that visit reef patches and soon move off again, and less pronounced (but still significant) for resident clients that do not move between reef patches. Surprisingly, the presence or absence of cleaner fish also affected the distribution of resident fish that hardly ever interact with them.6.

"Challenges of coastal area management in coastal developing countries - lessons from the proposed Rufiji delta prawn farming project, Tanzania","Masalu, DCP","Many developing countries are characterized by a poor economy and thus very small foreign earnings. As an effort to improve their economies most of these countries have adopted liberalization policies under the guidance of the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, these policies are increasingly becoming the source of conflicts over access to and resource use because they do not give proper consideration to the interests of the local communities. Additionally, projects that are known to be socially as well as environmentally destructive in nature are also taking advantage of liberalization policies to try to relocate their activities to Africa. This is a big challenge to African countries especially when the project is considered to offer an important opportunity to stir up the economy. Tanzania recently experienced such a challenge after a private investor proposed to develop an extensive prawn farm in Rufiji delta. The Rufiji delta is located in southern Tanzania and is the largest delta in eastern Africa. It contains the largest estuarine mangrove forest on the eastern coast of the African continent, and numerous other conservation and socio-economic values. Thus it is an ecologically and socially sensitive area. The project proposal caused many conflicts and was strongly opposed by local communities, environmentalists, social activists, and some government departments. However, it was given high priority by the central government, the reason behind being the estimated total export earnings that could be as much as US$500 million per year, more than double the country's total export earnings from other exports. It was also estimated that the project would create 2000 jobs for local communities. Following the crisis over the project, Tanzania started developing an Integrated Coastal Area Management (ICAM) policy as well as mariculture guidelines. It is hoped that given the level of awareness on ICAM in Tanzania, when these are in operation, will help to eliminate or reduce conflicts. However, revisiting the crisis over the project indicates that Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process, reviews of EIA, public participation and awareness, and a good ICAM policy should be backed-up by strong political will and commitment to a healthy environment on the part of decision makers, and truthfulness and fairness on the part of investors.

Management of tunas and tuna-like species in CARICOM countries: Recent trends urge a new perspective and approach,"Singh-Renton, S; Mahon, R; McConney, P","Fisheries for large pelagic resources are important to Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries. Many countries have been expanding these fisheries, and others have expressed the intention to do so. The management of tunas and tunalike species in the Atlantic Ocean is the mandate of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT): Several of these resources are fully or overexploited, with most of the catch being taken by large fishing nations of the Atlantic and distant water fleets.There is an urgent need for CARICOM countries to ensure that they will get a fair long-term share of the sustainable yield of large pelagic resources in the Atlantic Ocean. ICCAT has recently re-examined the criteria and is attempting to improve the process for allocating these resources among countries that fish in the Atlantic. CARICOM countries, many of them small island developing States (SIDS), have reached a common position that differs in several important respects from the position of the larger industrialized fishing nations. The principles underlying these positions depend on interpretations of clauses in the relevant UN Agreements that pertain to the treatment of new participants in these fisheries, the provisions for developing states, and the capacity for responsible management, as well as other factors.Also at issue is the management of stocks of small tuna and tuna-like species such as wahoo, Scomberomorus species and blackfin tuna, which are less widely distributed than the large tuna and billfish species. ICCAT monitors catch trends for most of these small tuna species, but their management is best handled by the appropriate regional or sub-regional arrangement. CARICOM countries are in the initial stages of exploring options for managing those pelagic species within their jurisdiction.",2003,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTY-FOURTH ANNUAL GULF AND CARIBBEAN FISHERIES INSTITUTE,,,175-+,WOS:000182548000014,,,#20440,Singh-Renton 2003,,
Occurrence and levels of indicator bacteriophages in bathing waters throughout Europe,"Contreras-Coll, N; Lucena, F; Mooijman, K; Havelaar, A; Pierzo, V; Boque, M; Gawler, A; Holler, C; Lambiri, M; Mirolo, G; Moreno, B; Niemi, M; Sommer, R; Valentin, B; Wiedenmann, A; Young, V; Jofre, J","Somatic coliphages, F-specific RNA bacteriophages, bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and enterococci were counted in bathing waters in the late spring and summer. We tested fresh and marine bathing waters from North, South, East and West Europe expected to contain between 100 and 500 E coli per 100 ml, although wider ranges were sometimes found. Bacteriophages were counted after concentration, since a preliminary study proved that this step was necessary to obtain positive counts. During monitoring, a first-line quality control with reference materials for bacteria and bacteriophages was performed by all the laboratories participating in the study. The same microbes were also counted in raw sewage samples from various areas in Europe, where the bacterial indicators and the three groups of bacteriophages were detected in roughly the same numbers. All groups of bacteriophages were detected in both fresh and marine bathing waters throughout Europe. Reliable and complete results from 147 samples showed that for log-transformed values, E. coli and bacteriophages were slightly correlated. However, the slope of the regression line changed according to E. coli concentration and the correlation diminished when this concentration was close to zero per 100 ml. The ratios between E coli and phages in bathing waters differed significantly from those in sewage. The relative amounts of bacteriophages, mainly somatic coliphages and phages infecting Bact. fragilis RYC2056, increased in bathing waters with low E coli concentration, especially in seawater samples containing < 100 E coli per 100 ml. The relationship of bacteriophages with respect to enterococci paralleled that of bacteriophages with respect to E coli. Somatic coliphages and bacteriophages infecting Bact. fragilis are useful to predict the presence of some pathogens with the same origin as present bacterial indicators but with higher survival rates.

"Provenance, environmental and paleogeographic controls on sandstone composition in an incised-valley system: the Eocene La Meseta Formation, Seymour Island, Antarctica","Marenssi, SA; Net, LI; Santillana, SN","The Eocene La Meseta Formation is the youngest exposed unit of the back-arc James Ross Basin, Antarctic Peninsula, cropping out in Seymour (Marambio) Island. The formation comprises 720 in of elastic sedimentary rocks of deltaic, estuarine and shallow marine origin. It was subdivided into six unconformity-based units (Valle de Las Focas, Acantilados, Campamento, Cucullaea I, Cucullaea II and Submeseta Allomembers) grouped into three main facies associations. Facies association I represents valley-confined deposition in a progradational/aggradational fide-dominated and wave-influenced delta front/delta plain environment. Facies association II includes tidal channels, mixed tidal flats, tidal inlets and deltas, washover and beach environments. Facies association III represents nonconfined tide- and storm-influenced nearshore environments. La Meseta Formation sandstones are quartzofeldspathic with some hybrid arenites (glauconite and carbonate bioclasts-rich). Sandstone detrital modes are subdivided into two distinctive petrofacies: the low quartz petrofacies (petrofacies I, Q < 55% and L > 12%), interpreted to retain the original provenance signal, and the high quartz petrofacies (petrofacies II, Q > 55% and L < 12%), representing the reworking product of the former after selective elimination of the more labile components. Petrofacies I sandstone framework grains were mainly derived from a dissected magmatic arc and an associated metamorphic belt. Textural evidence for recycling of some grains (e.g. garnet) from older sedimentary units during valley incision is not conclusive. Changes in the relative participation of source areas during the evolution of the incised-valley system are evaluated from the relative proportions of lithic fragments and monomineralic clasts derived from each rock type. Two lithic assemblages were recognized. The mixed lithic assemblage (Rv/Rm+Rp < 1.4) shows participation of all rock types; it represented valley-confined environments, either during the initial stage of valley development, or after main episodes of incision. The volcanic lithic assemblage (Rv/Rm+Rp > 1.4) is clearly dominated by volcanic-derived clasts; it developed at times of high sea level and/or during later stages of the valley fill, when an ""energy fence"" at the shoreline prevented delivery of sediment from the Antarctic Peninsula, thus enhancing the relative participation of local volcanic sources.

Management and restoration of European eel population (Anguilla anguilla): An impossible bargain,"Feunteun, E","The European eel panmicitic population has been declining at least since the 1980s throughout its distribution area. The stocks are now ten times lower than they were initially. The causes of this decline are reviewed in this paper: marine causes such as Gulf Stream shifts are thought to reduce survival of leptocephali larvae during their transoceanic migration, but inland causes are also suspected, i.e. overfishing of all continental stages, obstructions to upstream and downstream migrations, habitat loss, water quality, parasite and xenobiotic contamination, which together contribute to reducing quality and quantity of spawner escapement from European inland waters to sea. Restoration programs have been conducted in several inland hydrosystems in Europe. If local fisheries have been sustained mainly by stocking elvers and glass eels, no significant restoration of the population has been observed suggesting that restoration plans are inefficient, despite significant efforts and relevant technologies (fish passage). The causes for the failure of restoration projects are listed and discussed, and it is shown that the minimum scale to work at is the catchment area. But international cooperation is required to coordinate programs, to determine common objectives and policies. Concepts for Sustainable restoration and management are provided and discussed together with the general interest of eel population as a biointegrator of the quality and integrity of inland hydrosystems.

Thermodynamic attributes of Arctic boundary layer ozone depletion,"Strong, C; Fuentes, JD; Davis, RE; Bottenheim, JW","During spring 2000, a major ozone depletion episode was observed in the boundary layer at Alert, Nunavut, Canada. The ozone in the atmospheric layer extending from the surface to 1500 m was completely removed. This event lasted more than 9 days and was associated with an abrupt transition to an air mass that emanated from the Arctic Ocean. This source region provides the substrates that participate in the chemical reactions leading to ozone removal from the lower atmosphere. After the onset of the ozone depletion episode, the ozone-depleted air mass remained stagnant over the Alert region. In this study, thermodynamic and atmospheric dynamic characteristics of the lower troposphere are examined before, during and after the ozone depletion episode. With these analyses, we evaluate the research hypothesis that extended and regional ozone depletion events require air masses to travel over extensive regions rich in halogens that chemically remove ozone from the lower atmosphere. We establish the links between the atmospheric dynamic and thermodynamic attributes of ozone depletion episodes, chemically active air mass source regions, and locally measured chemistry. Evidence is also provided to show that the principal mechanism to replenish the atmospheric boundary layer with ozone is vertical transport of ozone from aloft down to the lower atmosphere. This transport mechanism is supported by strong wind shear regimes observed aloft. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"Species-specific responses of constitutively active receptor (CAR) - CYP2B coupling: lack of CYP2B inducer-responsive nuclear translocation of CAR in marine teleost, scup (Stenotomus chrysops)","Iwata, H; Yoshinari, K; Negishi, M; Stegeman, JJ","The mammalian constitutively active receptor (CAR) is a novel ligand-activated transcription factor that participates in controlling the expression of cytochrome P450 2B (CYP2B) genes in response to pharmaceutical agents (phenobarbital) and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (ortho-substituted PCBs). The occurrence and physiological function of this protein are as yet unknown in marine animals, where there has been a paradoxical lack of induction by PB-type chemicals. One approach to understanding CAR function is to study the evolutionary history of processes such as CAR-CYP2B coupling. In this study, CAR function was evaluated in a representative teleost fish (scup, Stenotomus chrysops). Treatment of scup with 1,4-bis [2- (3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP), which is one of the most potent CYP2B inducers in mouse, caused no increase in hepatic alkoxyresorufin O-dealkylase activity nor in immunodetectable CYP2B-like protein levels. Western blot analyses of scup livers using anti-human CAR antisera revealed the occurrence of a putative CAR homologue in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, but no nuclear accumulation of CAR following TCPOBOP treatment, which is a first step regulating the transcriptional activation of CYP2B genes in mouse. Immunohistochemical study also showed no translocation of CAR into nucleus in the hepatocytes of TCPOBOP-treated scup. These results suggest that there may be species-specific differences in CAR activation or CAR-CYP2B coupling signaling transduction in fish from those in mouse. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

"Integrated biochemical, molecular genetic, and bioacoustical analysis of mesoscale variability of the euphausiid Nematoscelis difficilis in the California Current","Bucklin, A; Wiebe, PH; Smolenack, SB; Copley, NJ; Clarke, ME","Integrated assessment of the euphausiid Nematoscelis difficilis (Crustacea; Euphausiacea) and the zooplankton assemblage of the California Current was designed to investigate individual, population, and community responses to mesoscale variability in biological and physical characters of the ocean. Zooplankton samples and observational data were collected along a cross-shelf transect of the California Current in association with the California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) Survey during October 1996. The transect crossed three domains defined by temperature and salinity: nearshore, mid-Current, and offshore. Individual N. difficilis differed in physiological condition along the transect, with higher size-corrected concentrations of four central metabolic enzymes (citrate synthetase, hexokinase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)) for euphausiids collected in nearshore waters than in mid-Current and offshore waters. There was little variation in the DNA sequences of the genes encoding PGI and LDH (all DNA changes were either silent or heterozygous base substitutions), suggesting that differences in enzyme concentration did not result from underlying molecular genetic variation. The population genetic makeup of X difficilis varied from sample to sample based on haplotype frequencies of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI; P = 0.029). There were significant differences between pooled nearshore and offshore samples, based on allele frequencies at two sites of common substitutions in the mtCOI sequence (P = 0.020 and 0.026). Silhouette and bioacoustical backscattering measurements of the zooplankton assemblage of the top 100 m showed marked diel vertical migration of the scattering layer, of which euphausiids were a small but significant fraction. The biochemical and molecular assays are used as indices of complex physiological (i.e., growth and condition) and genetic (i.e., mortality) processes; the bioacoustical observations provide insight into the ecosystem context for the single-species measurements. All data are intended for integration into predictive models of secondary production and biomass concentration in the ocean. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This analysis characterizes the abilities of these models to ventilate the ocean on timescales relevant for anthropogenic CO(2) uptake. We found a large range in the modeled global inventory (+/- 30%), mainly due to differences in ventilation from the high latitudes. In the Southern Ocean, models differ particularly in the longitudinal distribution of the CFC uptake in the intermediate water, whereas the latitudinal distribution is mainly controlled by the subgrid-scale parameterization. Models with isopycnal diffusion and eddy-induced velocity parameterization produce more realistic intermediate water ventilation. Deep and bottom water ventilation also varies substantially between the models. Models coupled to a sea-ice model systematically provide more realistic AABW formation source region; however these same models also largely overestimate AABW ventilation if no specific parameterization of brine rejection during sea-ice formation is included. In the North Pacific Ocean, all models exhibit a systematic large underestimation of the CFC uptake in the thermocline of the subtropical gyre, while no systematic difference toward the observations is found in the subpolar gyre. In the North Atlantic Ocean, the CFC uptake is globally underestimated in subsurface. In the deep ocean, all but the adjoint model, failed to produce the two recently ventilated branches observed in the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). Furthermore, simulated transport in the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) is too sluggish in all but the isopycnal model, where it is too rapid. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The Arctic Ocean - the management of change in the northern seas,"Holland, G","This paper covers some of the pressing problems of the Arctic Ocean, the existing structures and how cooperation in the region may develop. The region is surrounded by the lands of Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation and the United States of America, who together formed the Arctic Council in recognition of the fact that the issues facing the north exceed the capabilities and capacities of any one country and that successful solutions must be built on common actions. The expense and difficulty of operating in extreme conditions of the Arctic forced much of the significant arctic research into cooperative bilateral or multilateral projects, usually with a discrete research objective. Global organizations including the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the International Council for Science (ICSU), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) sponsor specific climate related programs in the Arctic. The warming trends in the Arctic provide the motivation for renewed attention on the Arctic, which is changing rapidly both environmentally and socially. The climate and pollution issues, both anthropogenic in origin, have created some priorities in governmental thinking and led to limited additional funding in recent years. Industry needs, to be responsive and innovative in incorporating stringent control and monitoring into development projects and in contributing to research and environmental management. Collective efforts by all interested governments will be needed to address the scarcity of research and observations, extending from the oceans to the coastal areas and drainage,basins of the hinterlands. Arctic countries must also pursue global arrangements to protect the Arctic from the impacts of pollution from outside areas. The work started by the Arctic Council needs to be bolstered by the establishment of a regional convention for the Arctic, which will confer more responsibility upon governments to continue with the programs.

Estimation of climate effects of land use changes with simple wind models,"Radics, K; Bartholy, J","Land has an important role in the climate system. Its spatial and temporal variability exceeds the ocean's. Roughness properties and participation of land in the moisture exchange process underline its importance. Because of increasing land degradation and land use change in the last century a better understanding of these processes is required. For this purpose several new modelling approaches have been developed recently. Population of high and middle latitudes has to face additional problems: frozen soil, snowpack and ice cover of the surface change its characteristic features. The latest IPCC assessment report (2001) also emphasises the importance of the above mentioned processes.In the frame of a research project on renewable energy sources which is specially focused on potential usage of wind energy, a linear spectral wind model has been applied and tested for different types of terrain conditions. In this paper effects of agricultural land use variations on wind fields are discussed. Comparative case studies were carried out to analyse the applicability of the WAsP model on different terrain conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"An analysis of a zooplankton sampling-gear change in the CalCOFI long-term monitoring program, with implications for copepod population abundance trends","Rebstock, GA","The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program has been systematically sampling zooplankton off the west coast of North America since 1949. In 1978, the 1-m diameter ring net used by the program was replaced with a bongo net, which consists of two 0.71-m diameter nets on a single frame. This study compares paired zooplankton samples taken with a ring net and a 0.71-m or 0.6-m bongo net to determine the relative performances of the two net types for catching calanoid copepods. Thirty-one species and stages were enumerated, along with the category 'total female calanoids'. Twenty-one categories of calanoid copepods were abundant enough to test for effects of changes in net type. No significant differences between the nets were found after correcting for multiple testing. Statistical power was then estimated for a range of potential net effects equivalent to ratios of copepod densities between the nets of 1.1-3.0. The probability of detecting differences greater than a factor of 1.5-3.0 was high (greater than or equal to80%) for total female calanoids, Metridia pacifica, Pleuromamma abdominalis edentata, P. borealis, Calanus pacificus, Eucalanus californicus and Rhincalanus nasutus. For these categories of copepods, any population changes greater than a factor of 1.5-3.0 that might be found from the CalCOFI data set can be assumed to be the result of factors other than the change in net type.

Local community training and education in southern Tanzania - a case study,"Howe, V","Local coastal communities are highly dependent upon the marine environment not only for protein but also as a primary source of income. In addition, there are growing economic opportunities offered within the coastal zone. As populations increase in these areas there is an increasing demand on coastal resources. This in turn requires effective management initiatives at regional, national and local levels.The Marine Education and Training Programme in Mtwara, southern Tanzania was a small scale capacity building project that incorporated two elements; a primary schools field day education programme and a marine coastal resources course for fishermen and women from the Mtwara District. The programme ran for a period of I year and during that time 14 schools, 198 children, 34 fisher-men, 2 women and 14 villages participated. Results from preliminary evaluation indicated that such education is not only welcome by the local government offices, teachers, village chairmen and fishermen as an expansion of the knowledge base, but is also an important and valuable stepping stone for the local communities to become active in issues regarding the management of coastal resourses.

Effects of experience and uncertainty during dynamic decision making,"Kobus, DA; Proctor, S; Holste, S","The decision response times in a dynamic tactical scenario in which participants interacted with a virtual command-post environment was investigated. Fifty-two Marines with varying amounts of command-post experience assessed the situation as it developed, determined tactical leverage points, formed a plan of action, and submitted battle orders. Two scenarios were studied-each differed in the level of certainty in the information provided. The tactical decision process was modeled and analyzed in the following sequential, cognitive stages: situation assessment, course of action selection, course of action execution. Results show that the time required to assess the situation was significantly longer (p < 0.05), for the high-experience group than the low-experience group. However, once the assessment was complete, the selection of a course of action (COA) was significantly faster for the high-experience group than the low-experience group. In addition, COA selection under conditions of low certainty was significantly longer than under conditions of high certainty. Time required for COA execution indicated a significant main effect of experience (p < 0.05), a main effect of task certainty approaching statistical significance (p = 0.067), and a statistically significant interaction (p < 0.05). These results indicate that the time needed to execute the COA, once determined, is significantly less for the highly experienced individuals under conditions of low certainty. However, under the conditions of high certainty, no statistically significant time differences were found based upon the experience level. The high-experience group was significantly more accurate than the low-experience group for developing an appropriate COA. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Physical features of the eastern Mediterranean resulting from the integration of POEM data with Russian Mediterranean Cruises,"Hecht, A; Gertman, I","Two large-scale investigations of the eastern Mediterranean: POEM - an international cooperative effort, and GOIN - an initiative of the former USSR, were carried out between 1985 and 1995. The two projects were not coordinated and therefore the cruises of the two sometime overlap and sometime complement each other in time and in space. Statistical comparison between adjacent stations and comparisons between parameter maps indicated that there is no need to adjust any of the data and that the two data bases could be combined into a single POEM - GOIN data base (PGDB). The PGDB was employed for the description of winter and summer distributions of temperature and salinity in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. These appear to differ in some respects from the climatologies extracted from the MODE or from those extracted from the Naval Oceanographic Office gridded hydrographic data base. Since the MODE contains a large number of coastal cruises which were intended to monitor the Nile floods, the MODE salinity climatology reflects the conspicuous effects of those floods. However, this feature disappeared with the closure of the Aswan dam in 1965. On the other hand, some well-known mesoscale features of the eastern Mediterranean circulation do not appear in the climatological fields. We conclude that the differences are due to indiscriminate averaging, which does not produce a useful representative climatology. The PGDB also provided useful additional information in the southern region of the Ionian Sea, which was not covered by POEM cruises. Thus, details of the southern branch of the MAW, the branch that flows directly from the Sicily straits to the Cretan Passage, could be described. The PGDB allowed us to follow the history of the Irapetra Gyre and to show that, indeed, the gyre appeared only in the summer of 1987 and, apparently, lasted only until 1995. We describe the changes throughout: this period, in intensity, size, and position of the Irapetra Gyre. The examination of previous cruises as well as a thorough search through the data of Med Atlas I indicated some occurrences of the Irapetra Gyre before its description by the POEM investigation, and therefore this gyre should be defined as a recurrent feature.

Heterogeneity in biofilms,"Wimpenny, J; Manz, W; Szewzyk, U","Biofilms, accumulations of microorganisms at interfaces, have been described for every aqueous system supporting life. The structure of these microbial communities ranges from monolayers of scattered single cells to thick, mucous structures of macroscopic dimensions (microbial mars: algal-microbial associations; trickling filter biofilms). During recent years the structure of biofilms from many different environments has been documented and evaluated by use of a broad variety of microscopic, physico-chemical and molecular biological techniques, revealing a generally complex 3D structure. Parallel to these investigations more and more complex mathematical models and simulations were developed to explain the development, structures, and interactions of biofilms. The forces determining the spatial structure of biofilms, including microcolonies, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and channels, are still the subject of controversy. To achieve conclusive explanations for the structures observed in biofilms the cooperation of both fields of investigation, modelling and experimental reseal ch. is necessary. The expanding field of molecular techniques not only allows more and more detailed documentation of the spatial distribution of species. but also of functional activities of single cells in their biofilm environment. These new methods will certainly reveal new insights in the mechanisms involved in the developmental processes involved in the formation and behavior of biofilms.

Institutional arrangements for fisheries: alternate structures and impediments to change,"Lane, DE; Stephenson, RL","The precarious state of many of the world's important commercial fisheries have called into question the ability of government agencies to carry out mandates related to stock conservation and sustainability. This paper argues that the prominent role of government agencies in building fisheries management systems of the past few decades, has led to the prevalent situation that management is top-down and has fostered the view that these institutions are ""in control"". In that view, the fishing sector has generally been excluded from management and is depicted as fundamentally irresponsible with regard to resource sustainability. A paternal government-industry relationship diminishes the opportunity for the fishing industry to become a responsible partner in fisheries management. We argue that institutional arrangements are a major impediment to effective management change. We consider the problem of managing commercial fisheries under current institutional structures by examining the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans as a case study. We outline the benefits of alternative bottom-up and participative decision making for fisheries and discuss the requirements for more effective institutional arrangements that would empower stakeholders toward building a real stakeholders-government partnership.

Toxaphene in standard solutions and cleaned biota extracts - results of the first QUASIMEME interlaboratory studies,"de Boer, J; Oehme, M; Smith, K; Wells, DE","Two interlaboratory studies on individual toxaphene congeners have been organised by the project Quality Assurance of Information for Marine Environmental. Monitoring in Europe (QUASIMEME). Fifteen laboratories analysed two standard solutions in the first study and 13 laboratories analysed a standard solution and two cleaned biota extracts in the second study. The coefficients of variation obtained Tor the standard solutions were 6-21% and for the cleaned extracts 16-39%. Although the results were comparable to those of other studies, further improvement in the level of agreement between the participating laboratories was considered possible.

Dietary supplementation with highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid does not influence PAI-1 activity,"Hansen, JB; Grimsgaard, S; Nordoy, A; Bonaa, KH","Impaired fibrinolysis due to elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) is a risk factor for atherothrombotic disease. Many studies have reported a positive correlation between serum triglycerides and PAI-1 activity. Dietary intervention with very long n-3 fatty acids from marine sources is known to decrease serum triglycerides, but an adverse increase in PAI-1 activity has been reported in some studies. A double blind, placebo controlled study was conducted among 224 middle-aged (ages 36-56), healthy, non-smoking men in which the participants were randomly assigned to daily supplementation with 3.8 g eicosapentaenoic acid/d, 3.6 g docosahexaenoic acid/d, or 4.0 g corn oil/d (placebo) for 7 weeks. PAI-1 activity increased by 2.35 +/- 6.24 U/ml (28%), 1.15 +/- 6.74 U/ml (14%), and 1.33 +/- 5.64 U/ml (22 %) during dietary supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and corn oil, respectively, but the changes were not significantly different between groups (p = 0.43). There was no relationship between change in concentrations of serum triglycerides or phospholipid n-3 fatty acids and change in PAI-1 activity. At baseline, analysis was performed to investigate the influence of dietary lipids, blood lipids, and serum fatty acids on plasma concentrations of PAI-1 activity. Dietary intake of saturated fat correlated directly with PAI-I both in crude analysis (r = 0.14, p < 0.05) and after adjustment for age and body mass index (kg/m(2)) (r = 0.20, p < 0.01). Furthermore, PAI-1 was associated with body mass index (r = 0.32, p < 0.001), apo-B100 (r = 0.27, p < 0.001), serum triglycerides (r = 0.31, p < 0.001), and the concentration of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (r = 0.22, p < 0.01) in serum. In a multiple regression analysis, 21% of the variation in PAI-1 activity could be explained by these variables. Plasma PAI-1 activity did not correlate with dietary intake or serum concentrations of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. In a review of 17 trials, including 935 subjects that assessed the effect of n-3 fatty acids on PAI-1 activity, an overall 17.7% increase in PAI-1 activity was estimated by n-3 supplementation. However, only two studies were able to demonstrate a significant increase in PAI-1 attributable to n-3 fatty acid supplementation. We conclude that there is no strong evidence for an unfavourable, clinically relevant effect of n-3 fatty acids on PAI-1 activity in plasma. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Scientific characterization and monitoring: Its application to integrated coastal management in Malaysia,"Nickerson-Tietze, DJ","The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is assisting Asian region member nations to develop and implement coastal management approaches to improve fisheries resources. Approaches are adapted to specific geographic, political, and cultural needs of each member nation.In Malaysia, the Department of Fisheries Malaysia, FAO, and the Bay of Bengal Program have been working together in the design and implementation of a Special Area Management (SAM) approach to address the issues facing the Pulau Payar Marine Park along the west coast of Malaysia. Early results of the scientific work have assisted in achieving the SAM project objectives. For example, science applied in the project helped participants to view the issues objectively, to gauge the effectiveness of past management actions, and to guide decisions on future actions.Important success stories of the SAM project discussed in the paper include: (1) Pulau Payar Marine Park appears to be succeeding at what it set out to do (i.e., sustain or enhance fisheries productivity); (2) ""unmanaged tourism"" seems to have greater adverse impact than previous fisheries practices; (3) it is possible to identify and promote tourist activities that reduce or eliminate harm to coral reefs; (4) the ground has been laid to tackle the infrastructure and development-related issues identified through the multi-sectoral SAM process as having major impacts on both water quality and coral reefs; and (5) multisectoral and scientific input can be successfully sought and incorporated to identify issues for management attention and decision making.",2000,,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,10,2,386-396,WOS:000086008300006,10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[0386:SCAMIA]2.0.CO;2,,#20462,Nickerson-Tietze 2000,,
The influence of chloride binding on the chloride induced corrosion risk in reinforced concrete,"Glass, GK; Buenfeld, NR","Chloride binding by the cement in concrete may affect the rate of chloride ingress and chloride threshold level which in turn determine the time to chloride induced corrosion initiation. In this work, a theoretical assessment of the influence of binding when chloride ingress results from diffusion, is presented. While chloride binding reduces the free chloride content within the concrete, it may increase or decrease the total chloride content depending on the distance from the concrete surface. The total chloride content at the transition between these effects is independent of the period of diffusion and value of the diffusion coefficient. The time to corrosion initiation of embedded steel is dependent on the corrosion risk presented by bound chloride. Bound chloride may participate in corrosion initiation when the establishment of pH gradients are required to sustain passive film breakdown. This is the result of the effect on the pore solution chemistry of the pH dependent solubilities of solid phases containing bound chloride that are very similar to that of calcium hydroxide. In some circumstances: the time to corrosion initiation may be reduced by an increase in binding because of the possible corrosion risk presented by bound chloride. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Secondary organic aerosol formation in cloud and fog droplets: a literature evaluation of plausibility,"Blando, JD; Turpin, BJ","This paper investigates the hypothesis that cloud and fog processes produce fine organic particulate matter in the atmosphere. The evidence provided suggests that cloud and fog processes could be important contributors to secondary organic aerosol formation, and the contribution of this formation pathway should be further investigated. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (1) many organic vapors present in the atmosphere are sorbed by suspended droplets and have been measured in cloud and fog water, (2) organics participate in aqueous-phase reactions, and (3) organic particulate matter is sometimes found in the size mode attributed to cloud processing (i.e. the droplet mode). Specific compounds identified as potential precursors include aldehydes (e.g. formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and propionaldehyde), acetone, alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, and phenol), monocarboxylic acids, and organic peroxides. Carboxylic acids (e.g. diacids and ore-acids), glyoxal, esters, organosulfur compounds, polyols, amines and amino acids are potential products of cloud and fog processing.

Coastal environment assessment procedure for sustainable wastewater management in tropical islands: the Mayotte example,"Gourbesville, P; Thomassin, BA","The recent evolution of the coastal environment is characterized by an increase of human potential impacts: coastal zone is located at the cross-road of sectoral issues which give rise to a number of often competing uses. Today, the main challenges in the coastal environment management are not derived from ""technical problems"" but correspond to the global coastal management and to the means to harmonize the different uses. This new approach has generated the need to apply systemic concepts which are able to describe and analyze large and complex systems. In the coastal zone - and especially in sensitive environments such as tropical island surrounded by coral reefs, lagoons or boat channels - one of the major challenges is to conciliate the waste waters and pipe outfalls management and the ecological preservation. The paper presents the results which have been obtained with a global approach for the definition of a sustainable wastewater management strategy in highly sensitive coastal areas located in Mayotte, (Comoros archip, Indian Ocean). This example allows to explain and identify the necessary tools and essential procedures as hydrodynamic modelling or public participation. From this application, a procedure for a coastal environment assessment procedure is formulated and proposed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A comparison of tourists and local visitors to National Estuarine Research Reserve sites,"USDA; Marsinko, A; Norman, WC; McClinton, TJ","The National Estuarine Research Reserve system serves as a laboratory and classroom where the effects of both natural and human activity can be monitored and studied. Visitors to twelve National Estuarine Research Reserve system sites were surveyed to obtain information about demographics, participation, experience with the system, activities, and opinions. Comparisons were made between local respondents and tourists based on distance traveled to the sites. About 26% of the respondents were tourists. Almost all of the respondents were white, non-Hispanic and most were female with females slightly more prevalent in the local group. Tourists were slightly younger than locals and were more likely to work full time. About 48% of the tourists attended graduate school versus 35% of the local respondents.Tourists visited the sites less frequently but spent more time per visit and spent more time at the site per year. The study sites were the primary destination for 66% of the locals and only 19% of the tourists, indicating that tourists were on multipurpose trips. Although more tourists (9%) made the decision to visit the site at least three months in advance (versus 3.2% of locals), 33% decided to visit the site on the day of the visit (versus 28% of locals).In general, levels of satisfaction with the sites and likelihood of future visits were similar for both groups. Interest in education program topics was similar between groups except that tourists were significantly more interested in environmental issues and environmental ethics. Both groups considered it important to understand nature and the role of wildlife. Tourists placed significantly greater importance on the role played by wildlife and the existence of wildlife. Neither group placed much importance on hunting or trapping wildlife. Activities were similar between groups except that tourists were more likely to take photos, beach comb, swim, and bike, while locals were more likely to canoe and be involved with organized group programs.

The primary means of data collection were document analysis, interviews with individuals representative of user groups, focus groups and participant observation. The results regarding user's awareness, user groups' relations with the managing agency, relations among and within user groups, resource use patterns, and sociocultural values demonstrate the need to: increase public awareness of the benefits of the Park, increase user awareness of Park management activities, increase user involvement in Park management, and develop intersectoral coordination.

Opportunities for offshore mineral exploration in the Indian Ocean,"Desa, E","The Indian Ocean offers several opportunities for offshore mineral resources in the nearshore and coastal areas, the EEZs of different countries as well as the deep sea regions. With the increasing demands and depletion of land resources, the oceans are being looked upon as the future source of these minerals for sustaining the industrial development. The coastal and nearshore resources of heavy mineral placers are being successfully mined in some of the countries around the Indian Ocean, and ample opportunity lies in exploring for these resources in the hitherto unexplored areas, to build up the reserves for the future.Simultaneously, activities in the deep sea areas for polymetallic nodules, crusts and sulfides need acceleration owing to their potential for strategic metals, such as cobalt, nickel, lead and zinc. These efforts call for cooperation and sharing of facilities, infrastructure, know-how and expertise, among the national as well as international agencies for exploration, mining, impact assessment and metallurgical process development.

A business of reliability,"Engel, P","The presentation is organized around three themes:1- The decrease of reception equipment costs allows non-Remote Sensing organization to access a technology until recently reserved to scientific elite. What this means is the rise of ""operational"" executive agencies considering space-based technology and operations as a viable input to their daily tasks. This is possible thanks to totally dedicated ground receiving entities focusing on one application for themselves, rather than serving a vast community of users.2- The multiplication of earth observation platforms will form the base for reliable technical and financial solutions. One obstacle to the growth of the earth observation industry is the variety of policies (commercial versus non-commercial) ruling the distribution of the data and value-added products. In particular, the high volume of data sales required for the return on investment does conflict with traditional low-volume data use for most applications. Constant access to data sources supposes monitoring needs as well as technical proficiency.3- Large volume use of data coupled with low-cost equipment costs is only possible when the technology has proven reliable, in terms of application results, financial risks and data supply. Each of these factors is reviewed. The expectation is that international cooperation between agencies and private ventures will pave the way for future business models.As an illustration, the presentation proposes to use some recent non-traditional monitoring applications, that may lead to significant use of earth observation data, value added products and services: flood monitoring, ship detection, marine oil pollution deterrent systems and rice acreage monitoring.",1999,,"SENSORS, SYSTEMS, AND NEXT-GENERATION SATELLITES III",3870,,591-596,WOS:000085492800061,10.1117/12.373222,,#20472,Engel 1999,,

Current regional issues include localized destruction of coral reefs, seagrass and mangroves; declines in some fisheries; exploitation of some endangered species; pollution from the development and transport of petroleum; and disposal of industrial and municipal wastes. The underlying causes of these issues are the natural vulnerability of the Red Sea due to its semi-enclosed nature; economic reliance on the petroleum industry; significant navigation risks; a rapidly increasing coastal population and associated developments; lack of fisheries information, surveillance and management; poor coastal zone planning; and limited technical expertise. Strategic actions addressing these issues will need to be implemented regionally and focus on coastal zone management that integrates environmental planning, environmental assessment and review; training and institutional development; public awareness and participation; information gathering especially fisheries statistics: reducing navigation risks; and the development of resource management and conservation strategies.

US-European collaboration in space science,Natl Res Council; European Sci Fdn,"This is a slightly edited version of the Executive Summary of a joint report on cooperation in space science produced by the Space Studies Board of the USA National Research Council and the European Space Science Committee of the European Science Foundation. Using analysis of 13 case-study missions it reviews 30 years of joint missions and makes 14 recommendations based on its findings. These include the importance of setting a scientific rationale for each mission and of ensuring that objectives are shared by engineers and others involved in it, the need for independent periodic assessments and that all agreements should specify the scope, expectations and obligations of the respective agencies and relevant partners.The USA and Europe have been cooperating in space science for more than three decades. This history of cooperation has survived significant geopolitical, economic and technological changes, such as the end of the Cold War, the pressure of budget reductions and the increasing focus on economic competition and the global marketplace. Both Europe and the USA have learned from one another and acquired a knowledge base as well as an infrastructure to implement joint missions and research activities. More importantly, the decades of cooperative space research efforts between the USA and Europe have built a community of scientists whose joint scientific exchanges have established a heritage of cooperation on both sides of the Atlantic.The scientific fruits of this heritage are plainly evident in achievements such as a signature for supermassive black holes provided by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST); the first views of the solar atmosphere and corona illuminated by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO); the sharing of expensive research facilities on the International Microgravity Laboratory (IML); and the impressive data on ocean altimetry from the Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX-POSEIDON) mission, which is significantly improving our understanding of global ocean circulation.There were no guideposts for the emergence of space science cooperation between Europe and the USA. In the process of introducing new procedures and improvements to facilitate cooperation, missteps occurred, and there were political, economic and scientific losses. This report takes stock of US-European history in cooperative space endeavors, the lessons it has demonstrated and the opportunities it suggests to enhance and improve future US-European cooperative efforts in the sciences conducted in space.

Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and carbon monoxide (CO) in natural waters: evidence of a coupled production pathway,"Pos, WH; Riemer, DD; Zika, RG","The mechanisms for the photoproduction of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and carbon monoxide (CO) in natural waters were studied by evaluating experimental results from different aqueous systems. A coupled photoproduction mechanism was observed operating on CO and OCS. For CO photoproduction, the presence of a carbonyl group is necessary, while for OCS, a source of reduced sulfur in addition to the carbonyl is required. An acyl radical is postulated to be the key intermediary for OCS and CO photoproduction while a sulfur-centered radical (thiyl or sulfhydryl radical) is likely to be the key species that reacts with acyl radicals to produce OCS. Laboratory experiments indicated that addition of reduced sulfur to seawater and subsequent irradiation leads to a decrease in CO and an increase in OCS photoproduction rates relative to original water. Furthermore, treatment of Suwannee fulvic acid (SFA) or Aldrich humic (AH) aqueous solutions with sodium borohydride (NaBH(4)) decreased photoproduction of CO compared to untreated samples. A metal redox system (Ce(IV)/Ce(III)) was also used to generate radicals in solution and demonstrate radical participation in the production processes of OCS and CO. Based on these results, potential pathways are proposed for the photoproduction of both gases in natural waters involving the formation of free radicals. In natural waters, the anti-correlation CO/OCS is likely to be seen in areas with high biological productivity in which reduced sulfur compounds and dissolved organic matter are abundant. This study furthers our understanding of sulfur chemistry in aqueous systems and provides another demonstration of the complex link of the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and sulfur.

"Intensive culture of shrimp Penaeus vannamei in floating cages: zootechnical, economic and environmental aspects","Paquotte, P; Chim, L; Martin, JLM; Lemos, E; Stern, M; Tosta, G","In the framework of the France-Brazil cooperation in Oceanology, experiments have been carried out in the State of Bahia (Brazil) from 1992 on, in order to design a new technology for culture shrimps in floating cages in an estuarine zone. The zootechnical research has focused on the species Penaeus vannamei which has been tested in different rearing conditions (density in the cages) and seasons (wet and dry). The results may be compared with the most intensive and costly technologies which are practised in Asian countries. The average growth rate is about 0.8 g wk(-1) and the average final biomass is 800 g m(-2). The achieved results are all the more important as they are obtained with a simple technology which does not require energy for pumping and mechanical water aeration. Investigations on the impact of this kind of technology, carried out on a pilot site with estuarine conditions after three years of farming activity, showed no measurable effect on the sediment (in terms of organic matter) and in the water (in terms of oxygen). Economic analysis was recorded from the very beginning of the project, making it possible to design a computerised simulation tool in order to assess the feasibility of such an operation and to help in decision making for future research and development.

"Tectonic structure and petroleum potential of Tayabas Bay southeast Luzon, Philippines","Bacud, J; Moore, A; Lee, CS","Tayabas Bay is one of four offshore Philippine areas where the Australian Geological Survey Organization and the Philippine Department of Energy conducted a cooperative marine seismic, gravity, magnetic, bathymetry and geochemical survey. The project acquired new seismic data and reprocessed the 1983 World Bank seismic sections which were all integrated with previous oil company data. In the absence of wells drilled offshore, interpretation of offshore seismic data was complemented by onshore well log information and stratigraphy of the Bondoc Peninsula. Geochemistry data, both offshore and onshore, were analyzed to confirm the presence of mature source rocks and hydrocarbon migration. A new seismic interpretation has revealed the structure of this tectonically active geologically complex area. A major structural feature interpreted in offshore Tayabas Bay was a N-NW-trending strike-slip fault which is believed to be a northern splay of the Sibuyan Sea Fault. The authors named this fault the Tayabas Bay Fault and due to its association with the Philippine Fault System the movement is assumed to be left-lateral. The present study suggested the presence of a prolific source rock in the Middle Miocene Vigo Formation and/or the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene Panaon Limestone. Oil and gas generation have been and are occurring in the Bondoc Sub-basin. Two groups of reservoirs were identified, the shelf carbonates beneath the Middle Miocene shales on the Marinduque Platform and the early Middle Miocene carbonates and basin-floor clastics near the base of the Vigo Formation. Carbonate reservoirs an believed to be present in traps formed when the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene carbonate reefs and shelf deposits of the Panaon Limestone were buried by the Middle Miocene shales. A later set of traps was formed and possibly superimposed by the intense deformation associated with the Philippine Fault System which has continued from the Late Pliocene up to the present. Evaluation for hydrocarbon reserves of several possible traps identified three significant leads, namely the Yuni Lead in the south, the Mulanay in the central area and the Mabio in the North.

Chlorobiphenyls and organochlorine pesticides in fish and sediments - Three years of QUASIMEME laboratory performance studies,"De Boer, J; Wells, DE","A series of five laboratory performance studies on the analysis of chlorobiphenyls (CBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) has been conducted within the three year EU-QUASIMEME (Quality Assurance of Information for Marine Environmental Monitoring in Europe) programme. The results of the Rounds 4 and 5 and the overall results of this programme are discussed, It was shown that laboratories with a positive attitude towards qualtiy control could improve the accuracy of their data substantially. This is mainly explained by the learning element of the programme, which consisted of giving detailed advice and guidance to the participants and the organisation of a workshop. Two distinct recommendations are given to managers of marine monitoring programmes. To obtain a higher accuracy in monitor programmes, particularly for the component dealing with temporal trend studies, it is recommended that a small group of qualified laboratories should be selected to carry out such a task. Secondly the currently available analytical methods for CBs and OCPs do not allow the production of very accurate results when concentration are below 1 mu g/kg. (C) 1997 Science Ltd.

"The QUASIMEME Laboratory Performance Study of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH): Assessment of the first three rounds, 1994-1995","Law, RJ; Klungsoyr, J; Freriks, IL","A Laboratory Performance Study (LPS) has been undertaken to improve the measurement of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in marine sediments as part of the QUASIMEME project. The first three rounds of the exercise included the analysis of standard solutions, and both raw and cleaned-up sediment extracts, and were intended to test calibration, chromatographic performance and clean-up techniques. The methods used were based on both gas chromatography (GC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The number of participating laboratories was 25 in Rounds 1 and 2, and 16 in Round 3. For the 10 PAH determined, robust coefficients of variation for the analysis of standard solutions varied from 8-30%, 13-22%, and 8.8-21% in the three rounds of the exercise to date. For a raw sediment extract the robust coefficients of variation varied from 17-34%. The two major factors limiting performance were calibration procedures, which seemed to apply across the range of PAH determined, and the need to avoid errors when calculating results. Good results can be obtained using both GC and HPLC techniques when methods are selected and applied properly, with appropriate care and control.

MARINE RESERVES IN NEW-ZEALAND - A SURVEY OF COMMUNITY REACTIONS,"WOLFENDEN, J; CRAM, F; KIRKWOOD, B","The social aspects in relation to the establishment of marine reserves have received little attention compared with the study of bio-physical phenomena. Subsequent to the passing of the Marine Reserves Act (1971), New Zealand led the world in protection of the marine environment with an area of non-extraction at Goat Island, Leigh. During the intervening years, no additional mainland marine reserves were created until the designation of Cathedral Cove marine reserve in 1993. The present study examined the nature of community reactions to marine reserve proposals. Beliefs, attitudes and knowledge regarding marine reserves were explored and related to the stance of the respondent (i.e. supporting or opposing a proposal for a marine reserve in their vicinity). Sample populations of 200 rate-payers from four target areas (two high-impact and two low-impact control areas) participated in a questionnaire study. Results confirmed the hypotheses that the establishment of marine reserves would be supported by the majority of respondents, dependent on the implementation of comprehensive social and environmental impact assessments, resulting in the identification of appropriate sites. Public involvement in the planning process, concomitant with information, communication and compromise were identified as strategies for reducing intergroup conflict.

An Evaluation of Tourists’ Compliance with Guidelines for Snorkeling in Haad Chao Mai Marine National Park,"Sangkhaduang, T.; Kongchouy, N.; Visuthismajarn, P.","This study aimed to examine factors affecting tourists’ compliance with the snorkeling guidelines of Haad Chao Mai Marine National Park, Thailand. The sample comprised 397 participants who were travelling to the park during January to February 2020. The data were collected using a questionnaire based on demographic information, participants’ awareness of the guidelines, awareness of legislation related to coral, and compliance with the guidelines. Univariate and multiple linear regression were done at 0.05 level of significance and 95% confidence interval to find the determinants of compliance with the guidelines. The results of univariate analysis between determinant and outcome showed that age, numbers of snorkeling completed, prior snorkeling experience at the park, and awareness of the guidelines were significantly associated with their compliance with the guidelines independently. However, the results from multiple regression analysis showed that only awareness of the guidelines was related to participants’ compliance with the guidelines. These results implied that having awareness of the guidelines contribute to positive behavior of the tourists toward tourist destination. © 2022.

Assessing the management effectiveness of China's marine protected areas: Challenges and recommendations,"Zeng, X.; Chen, M.; Zeng, C.; Cheng, S.; Wang, Z.; Liu, S.; Zou, C.; Ye, S.; Zhu, Z.; Cao, L.","Rapid population growth is putting enormous pressure on fragile marine ecosystems. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a widely adopted management tool to address these challenges, but their conservation effectiveness is uncertain, especially in developing countries such as China. Management effectiveness evaluation (MEE) is an efficient method for assessing MPA outcomes and identifying key impact factors. However, only a limited number of MEEs have been conducted for China's MPAs in the past two decades, thus largely limiting their improvement of management. In this context, we conducted a comprehensive review of MPAs status and existing MEEs in China. We found that despite the significant increase in the number and coverage of China's MPAs, their conservation effectiveness might be impacted by the lack of systematic planning, adequate funding, appropriate zoning, long-term monitoring, and sound laws. Major challenges to the evaluation of MPA management effectiveness in China include the lack of a standardized framework, limited survey data, financial support, and public engagement. To address these challenges, we developed a comprehensive framework based on the common objectives of China's MPAs and existing MEE frameworks. We also recommend based on the developed framework: 1) establishing long-term monitoring pilots in national MPAs; 2) providing sustained funding support for MEE, monitoring and capacity building from government, social capital, and ecotourism; and 3) promoting public participation in MPA management and evaluation through advocacy, incentive mechanisms, and establishment of committees. Adopting our recommendations can strengthen adaptive management and provide new insights into evidence-based decision-making for MPAs in China. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Ocean and Coastal Management,224,,,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106172,,#20488,Zeng 2022,,
Conservation of coral reef systems under Convention on Biological Diversity: China’s performance and suggestions,"Yi, T.; Haoran, Y.; Yanxuedan, Z.","Aims Coral reef ecosystems are important protecting targets under the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD). Since its accelerated bleaching has attracted enormous attention in 1998, the conservation of coral reef systems has been a significant topic in the Conference of the Parties (COP). To review China’s compliance under CBD, this article explores the following questions: Whether China fulfills its obligations to protect coral reef systems as prescribed under the CBD? What are the challenges for protecting coral reef systems in China by considering the requirements of the CBD? What suggestions are there for improving compliance with the CBD? Methods A comparative method was applied to identify the compliance gap under the CBD. Relevant reports on the changes of coral reef systems in Hainan, Guangxi and Guangdong province at national and provincial levels were explored. The law, regulations, and compliance reports of coral reef protection at national and provincial level were investigated. Results The results indicated that China has adopted many specific measures which have reversed the decline of coral reefs in general. However, there are several problems in its compliance, primarily fragmented legislation, the lack of comprehensive strategies and action plans, insufficient adaptation to climate change, inadequate coordination across departments, ineffective management in marine protected areas, low engagement with local communities, unintegrated standards and norms for supervision, poor monitoring data which could not support effective evaluation, little international cooperation, and low public participation. Suggestions This study suggests that compliance measures should be taken in consistency with the goals and spirits of the CBD, and in consideration of the post-2020 CBD framework. These measures include enhancing domestic legislative framework, comprehensive action plan and capacity to adapt to climate change, strengthening integrated management and coordination, improving the effectiveness in management of MPAs, ensuring better monitoring and data collection, better international cooperation and enhancing public participation. © 2022 Biodiversity Science.",2022,,Biodiversity Science,30,2,,,10.17520/biods.2021262,,#20497,Yi 2022,,
Contributions of marine area-based management tools to the UN sustainable development goals,"Gissi, E.; Maes, F.; Kyriazi, Z.; Ruiz-Frau, A.; Santos, C.F.; Neumann, B.; Quintela, A.; Alves, F.L.; Borg, S.; Chen, W.; da Luz Fernandes, M.; Hadjimichael, M.; Manea, E.; Marques, M.; Platjouw, F.M.; Portman, M.E.; Sousa, L.P.; Bolognini, L.; Flannery, W.; Grati, F.; Pita, C.; Natașa Văidianu; Stojanov, R.; van Tatenhove, J.; Micheli, F.; Hornidge, A.-K.; Unger, S.","Area-Based Management Tools (ABMTs) are spatial instruments for conservation and managing different forms of ocean use. A multitude of ABMTs exists in marine areas within and beyond national jurisdiction, ranging from tools for the regulation of specific human activities (e.g. fisheries, shipping, or mining) to cross-sectoral tools (e.g. such as marine protected areas, MPAs, and marine spatial planning, MSP). By applying expert elicitation and reviewing scientific and grey literature we evaluate the contribution of ABMTs to sustainable development goals (SDGs) as set out under the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including for SDG 14 that directly addresses the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas, and marine resources. We find that fisheries-related and conservation-related ABMTs, and MSP offer the greatest potential contributions to SDG 14 and to SDGs in general. Moreover, there is high complementarity and synergy among different ABMTs for most SDG 14 targets and other SDGs, with the exception of SDG target 14.6 Prohibit fisheries subsidies and SDG 7 Affordable and clean energy. We find that some ABMTs contribute directly to goal attainment, while others contribute in more nuanced or even unexpected ways. Furthermore, context-specific factors that relate to political and legal factors, enforceability, transparency, governance structure, and inclusivity are crucial for unlocking the full potential of ABMTs of attaining multiple SDGs, as shown through examples. The major challenge to face in the next decade is ensuring durable and equitable outcomes from ABMT implementation by coordinating ABMT initiatives established by different organisations and responsible authorities. It is also critical that outcomes are monitored and evaluated across environmental, social, economic, governance, and health dimensions, with indicators addressing management effectiveness and not only ABMT area coverage. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Journal of Cleaner Production,330,,,,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129910,,#20506,Gissi 2022,,
Adavance and implication for polymetallic nodules resources exploration in deep-sea ,"Chu, F.-Y.; Jiang, J.; Liu, Y.-W.; Li, H.-M.; Li, X.-H.; Zhu, K.-C.; Lü, S.-H.; Luo, Y.; Zeng, X.","As one of the first group of contractors for the polymetallic nodules mining areas in the international seabed areas, China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association (COMRA) has conducted mineral exploration and research of polymetallic nodules for nearly 30 years in the abyssal plain of the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCZ), eastern Pacific Ocean. In recent years, COMRA also promoted the application of the mining areas of the China Minmetals Corporation (CMC) and the Beijing Pioneer High-Tech Corporation (BPC) in the CCZ and seamount basins of the northwest Pacific Ocean. Here, the forming process of polymetallic nodules and deposit types was analyzed, and then the mineral exploration and research of the mining areas for the COMRA, CMC and BPC were reviewed. Comparisons of the mineral resource characteristics between the CCZ of the eastern Pacific Ocean and seamount basins of the northwest Pacific Ocean were conducted based on the previous data of the mineral exploration. According to the trending of the exploitation for polymetallic nodules, mining areas of polymetallic nodules would provide strategic reserve of the critical metals with our economic development. The CMC and the BPC would delineate the mining sites in order to have the capacity to apply for the exploitation contract.

Communicating complex marine science: Does media format matter?,"Kolandai-Matchett, K.; Armoudian, M.; Thrush, S.","Considering the deteriorated state of the ocean, maximizing the impact of scientists' media communication is essential for gaining public interest in, and support for, marine conservation initiatives. Unlike conventional news, that involves journalists' interpretation, the media Q&A offers scientists a way to convey insights on complex marine ecosystem issues in their own words. However, the Q&A approach for communicating marine science and conservation issues has not been empirically examined for format-related differences in impact. The modality theory in multimedia learning suggests that information is more effective for accelerating learning and retention when visuals are combined with narrated words, than when combined with written text. This study compared the effects of identically framed information presented in two different media Q&A formats: narrated multimedia (a video on YouTube) and written text with photos (designed to resemble an online mainstream news article). In both formats, a marine scientist explained the complex phenomenon of marine ecosystem tipping points. In an online experiment, 116 respondents were randomly assigned to either view the video or read the article. Effects on knowledge, awareness, and motivation were tested for format-related differences. Data related to time spent on the interventions were used to test the effects of attention retention on awareness and motivation gains. Additionally, the study gauged participants' assessment about the effectiveness of the communication features and framings used and suggestions for enhancing communication effectiveness. Findings showed positive effects on knowledge, awareness, and motivation irrespective of media format, suggesting that other communication aspects such as the messengers, the scientist's communication style, educative content, and message frames probably contributed to impact. Findings also suggest that multimedia formats, which tend to be more costly, may not necessarily be more effective. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2021,,Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems,31,7,1772-1790,,10.1002/aqc.3560,,#20539,Kolandai-Matchett 2021,,
Comparing five methods for quantifying abundance and diversity of fish assemblages in seagrass habitat,"French, B.; Wilson, S.; Holmes, T.; Kendrick, A.; Rule, M.; Ryan, N.","Seagrass fishes perform key ecological roles and are a critical component of many of the world's fisheries. A sound understanding of seagrass fish communities, based on robust methods, is therefore integral for their successful environmental management and conservation. Here we quantitatively compare taxa and size class of seagrass fish assemblages collected using; baited and unbaited remote underwater video (BRUV, URUV), diver operated video (DOV), underwater visual census (UVC) and trawling. We assess comparisons of these methods in terms of biodiversity indicators and power to detect change. All five methods were deployed in coastal embayments dominated by Posidonia spp. and within three marine parks along the south-western coast of Western Australia. Fish assemblages recorded using the different methods separated into two distinct groups; those dominated by smaller and less motile species, that are typically present beneath the canopy among seagrass leaves; and those dominated by larger, faster swimming species present above the seagrass canopy. Trawling provided the most effective method for assessing species within the canopy, including those of conservation concern. Conversely, BRUV followed by URUV recorded the greatest number of individuals, successfully detecting the larger supra-canopy and highly motile species typically omitted by trawling. Both trawl and BRUV methods had a higher power to detect change in species richness of seagrass fishes compared to other methods, even though each method recorded different components of the fish assemblage. Fish assemblages recorded using UVC detected both inter and supra-canopy species, but fish abundances recorded by this method were low compared to trawl and BRUV surveys, resulting in reduced power to detect change in richness. DOV was a comparatively less effective method, recording few fish, as well as low richness and diversity values. The combination of trawling and stationary video techniques, particularly BRUV, provided a two-method combination able to holistically measure commonly used indicators of fish assemblage composition in seagrass habitat. These results demonstrate that careful consideration of the methodology is essential when assessing ichthyofauna in seagrass habitat, particularly when only a single method can be employed. As the extent of methodological influence on recording fish assemblages also varied among the three survey areas, geographical differences in the structure of fish and seagrass communities should be considered when selecting an appropriate sampling method. © 2021",2021,,Ecological Indicators,124,,,,10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107415,,#20547,French 2021,,
Multi-decadal offshore wind power variability can be mitigated through optimized European allocation,"Neubacher, C.; Witthaut, D.; Wohland, J.","Wind power is a vital ingredient for energy system transformation in line with the Paris Agreement. Limited land availability for onshore wind parks and higher wind speeds over sea make offshore wind energy increasingly attractive. While wind variability on different timescales poses challenges for planning and system integration, little focus has been given to multi-decadal variability. Our research therefore focuses on the characteristics of wind power on timescales exceeding ten years. Based on detrended wind data from the coupled centennial reanalysis CERA-20C, we calculate European long-term offshore wind power potential and analyze its variability focusing on three locations with distinct climatic conditions: the German North Sea, the Greek Mediterranean and the Portuguese Atlantic coast. We find strong indications for two significant multi-decadal modes that are identified consistently using two independent spectral analysis methods and in the 20-year running mean time series. In winter, the long-term evolution of wind power and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are directly linked in Germany and Portugal. While German North Sea wind power is positively correlated with the NAO (r D 0:82), Portuguese Atlantic coast generation is anti-correlated with the NAO (r D 0:91). We evaluate the corresponding potential for spatial balancing in Europe and report substantial benefits from European cooperation. In particular, optimized allocations off the Portuguese Atlantic coast and in the German North Sea allow to reduce multi-decadal generation variance by a factor of 3-10 compared with country-level approaches. © Author(s) 2021.

VTSs (Vessel Traffic Systems) use several sources of information for estimating ships' Position Navigation and Velocity, such as AIS (Automatic Identification System) and RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging); nevertheless, VTS areas do not cover the entire costal area of a country. In many cases the classification and identification of small non-AIS vessels could provide an important to the safety of navigation.Indeed, especially during the summer, the nautical tourism has a great impact on the maritime traffic congestion.

"One Place, Different Communities’ Perceptions. Mapping Cultural Ecosystem Services in the Asinara National Park (Italy)","Lai, S.; Motroni, A.; Santona, L.; Schirru, M.","As innovative approaches emerge, the concept of Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES) is periodically revised and enhanced, presenting new value nuances. Due to their intrinsic site-specific character, CES usually call for subjective, rather than objective, perspectives. Therefore, assessing CES through alternative, non-monetary approaches, is fundamental. This issue becomes even more urgent when attempting to assess and map CES within natural protected areas, and even more so when such areas are non-inhabited, as the absence of any local communities poses additional challenges. In this study, initiated within the GIREPAM (Integrated Management and Ecological Network of Marine Protected Areas) Interreg project and developed within the NEPTUNE Interreg project, the way stakeholders perceive CES supplied by the Asinara National Park in Northern Sardinia (Italy) was investigated. Interviews and questionnaires were delivered in December 2019: more than 600 observations related to CES were mapped and recorded through a participatory GIS in order to investigate whether the different perception of CES supplied by a given natural protected area varies depending on the community. Differences were recorded among three local communities. Results show that significant differences exist in the choice of places, rather than in the perceived values of a natural protected area, and that such differences depend on the local community engaged in recognizing the various types of cultural values. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,,,12955 LNCS,,675-691,,10.1007/978-3-030-87007-2_48,,#20571,Lai 2021,,
Assessment of risks to listed species from the use of atrazine in the USA: a perspective,"Smith, P.N.; Armbrust, K.L.; Brain, R.A.; Chen, W.; Galic, N.; Ghebremichael, L.; Giddings, J.M.; Hanson, M.L.; Maul, J.; Van Der Kraak, G.; Solomon, K.R.","Atrazine is a triazine herbicide used predominantly on corn, sorghum, and sugarcane in the US. Its use potentially overlaps with the ranges of listed (threatened and endangered) species. In response to registration review in the context of the Endangered Species Act, we evaluated potential direct and indirect impacts of atrazine on listed species and designated critical habitats. Atrazine has been widely studied, extensive environmental monitoring and toxicity data sets are available, and the spatial and temporal uses on major crops are well characterized. Ranges of listed species are less well-defined, resulting in overly conservative designations of “May Effect”. Preferences for habitat and food sources serve to limit exposure among many listed animal species and animals are relatively insensitive. Atrazine does not bioaccumulate, further diminishing exposures among consumers and predators. Because of incomplete exposure pathways, many species can be eliminated from consideration for direct effects. It is toxic to plants, but even sensitive plants tolerate episodic exposures, such as those occurring in flowing waters. Empirical data from long-term monitoring programs and realistic field data on off-target deposition of drift indicate that many other listed species can be removed from consideration because exposures are below conservative toxicity thresholds for direct and indirect effects. Combined with recent mitigation actions by the registrant, this review serves to refine and focus forthcoming listed species assessment efforts for atrazine.

"Restoration of the silver-lipped pearl oyster Pinctada maxima (Jameson, 1901) in Phu Quoc marine protected area, Vietnam","Tuan, V.S.; Tuyen, H.T.","The silver-lipped pearl oyster has been exploited by fishermen in Vietnam for a long time, mainly serving as a material for encrusting with mother of pearl in traditional lacquer painting. Recently, the increased demands of the oyster shells for production of fine arts make this species more vulnerable and becoming locally extinct in many areas, including in Phu Quoc islands where the species was abundant in the past. The restoration was conducted at Hon Vang islet, southern Phu Quoc islands, using spats produced in the hatchery in Con Dao islands. Around 45 million spats were released in 2017 and 2019. Monitoring the growth indicated that the restored pearl oysters reached the size of 80,08 ± 10,02 mm after 2 years and 124,12 ± 17,74 mm at 3 years old. The restored population in December 2019 included different size groups ranging from 11–20 mm to 161–170 mm at which size some oysters would be mature, according to past studies on pearl oysters’ reproduction. In terms of management, the participation of private sector in oyster restoration exhibited a useful policy of MPA authorities in engaging local stakeholders in management of marine resources. In addition, expansion of restoring areas to include deeper waters is needed and use of “pearl oyster gardens” for tourist purpose is encouraged. © 2021 Phuket Marine Biological Center.

Balancing sustainable livelihoods and conservation in the marine environment,"Mifsud, M.C.","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are now a widely used tool for marine conservation and fisheries management. MPAs are an important management tool that can either help or hurt local livelihoods, depending on how they are developed, designed, and implemented. It is not unusual that fishermen resist the establishment or expansion of MPAs. This is usually done because fishermen may fear a reduction in their livelihood and also a decrease in their ability to access to their fisheries. The establishment of MPAs may therefore result in conflicts between fishers and state agencies. A further issue is that there may be increased conflicts between fishers and the tourism sector. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of stakeholders involved in the fisheries sector and the extent to which marine conservation impacts on their livelihoods. Extended interviews were undertaken with 26 stakeholders including fishermen, divers and dive centres. The study tried to address the issues through a communication and educational campaign drafted through higher education institutions. Research generally points towards the effective importance of incorporating stakeholders in meaningful participation for effective marine conservation planning and management. In actual fact MPAs are more likely to meet their biological and social goals if the human dimensions is integrated into the MPA design and evaluation process. This paper discusses a number of recommendations that increase communication channels between the authorities and the main stakeholders and the possible role of higher education institutions in mediating these channels through applied research. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",2021,,World Sustainability Series,,,19-33,,10.1007/978-3-030-63399-8_2,,#20575,Mifsud 2021,,
Conservation gap analysis for the yellow sea ecoregion,"Qu, F.; Li, S.; Zhao, L.; Yeung, C.; Wan, M.; Cai, L.; Zhang, Z.","Aims: The Yellow Sea Ecoregion is one of 43 marine ecoregions and is considered a global conservation priority as identified by World Wide Fund for Nature. The Yellow Sea Ecoregion comprises 460,000 km2, has a mean water depth of 46 m, and contains abundant biodiversity and biological resources. Due to intensified anthropogenic activities and global climate change, the Yellow Sea Ecoregion is facing severe transboundary threats, which have had strong negative impacts on important habitats and key species of the region. To address this issue, the World Wide Fund for Nature organized Chinese, Japanese, and Korean scientists to prepare an assessment report on the status of biodiversity in the Yellow Sea Ecoregion, in which 23 potential priority areas were identified to promote conservation of the region. Until 2019, China had established 152 marine protected areas covering an area of 80,400 km2 in the Yellow Sea Ecoregion, which aim to protect marine ecosystems and biodiversity. However, several issues with China’s management and construction of the marine protected areas, such as a lack of top-level design, limited management capacity, a lack of financial funding, and poorly balanced spatial development, leave many conservation gaps to be filled to ensure protected areas operate effectively. Therefore, it is of vital importance to improve the designation, management and development of marine protected areas within the Yellow Sea Ecoregion. Methods: In this paper, the research area was the portion of the Yellow Sea Ecoregion identified by World Wide Fund for Nature under China’s jurisdiction. We used a gap analysis to identify important yet unprotected coastal wetland, key marine species, and marine ecosystems of the Yellow Sea Ecoregion. We first identified the important ecological function zones, areas rich in biodiversity, important habitats, and landscape geological relics and mapped their distribution as potential priority areas. Next, we collected information on the distribution of existing marine protected areas. We then used ArcGIS 10.4 to compare the distributions of our identified potential priority areas with the distributions of existing marine protected areas to identify conservation gaps, and proposed new marine protected areas based on the identified gap patches. Results: Based on our analysis, the key conservation gaps of the Yellow Sea Ecoregion were located in the Yellow River estuary; the coastal wetlands in the Liaohe Estuary, Huanghua and Tanggu, the Jiaodong Peninsula, and Jiangsu Province; the Caofeidian seagrass bed; the Zhoushan fishing ground; and the breeding area and migratory route of spotted seal. The Daliao River Estuary and the southern part of Liaohe Estuary wetlands in Yingkou, the Caofeidian seagrass bed, the wetland along the east coast of Huanghua, the Tiaozini wetland, the Yuhe Estuary, and the Weihe Estuary wetland were the relatively larger gap patches. Spotted seal (Phoca largha), Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Eurynorhynchus pygmeus), East Asian Finless Porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis sunameri) and Common Minke Whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) were key species of concern. Conclusions: Our results suggest that new marine protected areas for Spotted Seal and Spoon-billed Sandpiper be established near Dalian along Jiangsu coast. At the same time, a lack of accurate distribution data hinders understanding the protection needs of East Asian Finless Porpoises and Common Minke Whales. To enhance our understanding of their distributions, further research and surveys of East Asian Finless Porpoises and Common Minke Whales are needed to inform the establishment of suitable protected areas and bolster the effectiveness of the marine protected network. We recommend that strengthening the scientific designation and management of marine protected areas, actively integrating resources from all sectors of society to conduct research and assessment, guaranteeing funding sources, promoting sustainable development of marine ecological industry, enhancing capacity building and the degree of stakeholder participation, and applying more creative cooperation approaches are fundamental to ensuring the success of future designation, management, and development of marine protected areas in the Yellow Sea Ecoregion. © 2021, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

A mind-body program for pain and stress management in active duty service members and veterans.,"Millegan, J.; Denninger, J.W.; Bui, E.; Jakubovic, R.J.; Ram, V.; Bhakta, J.; Hiller Lauby, M.D.; Mehta, D.H.; Sager, J.C.; Fricchione, G.; Sylvia, L.G.","The Mind-Body Medicine (MBM) program at the Naval Medical Center San Diego, created in collaboration with the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine and the Home Base Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, is a 7-week program designed to facilitate stress management habits into patient treatment plans. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a mind-body program for service members and veterans. Participants (N = 239) were primarily active duty service members of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps reporting significant perceived stress (Stress Resiliency (SR) group; n = 124), or meeting criteria for chronic pain (Pain Management (PM) group; n = 115). Participants completed measures at preprogram and post-program assessing for perceived stress, pain, functional impairment, quality of life, and psychological and somatic symptoms. Changes in self-reported psychological symptoms and knowledge and practice of mind-body principles were examined. Participants across groups had significant improvement in most outcomes (perceived stress, response to stressful experience, functional impairment, sleep disturbance, depression, PTSD, and anxiety symptoms; and each quality of life domain aside from social relationships), with p values < .0017 (Bonferroni corrected level of significance). The SR group demonstrated significant improvements in primary outcomes of perceived stress and response to stressful experience, and the PM group demonstrated significant improvement in pain severity, but not perceived stress. Significant change was observed in knowledge and practice of mind-body medicine principles, and high satisfaction was reported. Results suggest that a mind-body program may improve physical and psychological functioning for service members, including those facing significant perceived stress and chronic pain.

Spatial distribution patterns and the accessibility evaluation of oil and gas resources in Russia ,"Huang, J.; Zhang, T.; Wang, L.; Yang, L.; Ge, Q.","Russia is rich in oil, gas resources, and areas with unproven reserves, and also has a huge potential for application of oil and gas resources. As climate change intensifies, it would be possible for navigation in Arctic, and Russia hopes to vigorously develop its energy trade through the Arctic Sea Route. In this study, the Russian transportation network was regarded as the focus of connecting resources and ports, and spatial statistical method was used to describe the spatial distribution characteristics of Russian oil and gas resources. By means of grid cost distance, weighted average travel time and potential location advantage, the accessibility of oil and gas resources in each port was quantified, and the conclusions were drawn as follows. (1) The oil and gas resources were concentrated in the Western Siberian Plain. The accessibility of ports in the whole region of Russia was characterized by ""high in the west and low in the middle"". (2) The resource accessibility of the northeast port of Russia was generally poor, and the resource accessibility of the northwest port was better than that of the northeast one. Taking oil and gas resources, geographical location and project cooperation into account, we focused on the construction of three ports: Sabetta, Murmansk and Vladivostok. (3) The density of the nearby traffic network affected the resource accessibility of the port. With the climate warming, the melting of frozen soil, and the gradual implementation of the ""Polar Silk Road"" between China and Russia, it would be possible for further improvement in the resource accessibility of ports in the Far East region of Russia in the future. © 2020, Science Press.

Evaluation of conservation status of plants in Brazil's Atlantic forest: An ethnoecological approach with Quilombola communities in Serra do Mar State Park,"Conde, B.E.; Aragaki, S.; Ticktin, T.; Fonseca, A.S.; Yazbek, P.B.; Sauini, T.; Rodrigues, E.","The Atlantic Forest is considered the fourth most important biodiversity hotspot. Although almost 96% of its original area has been devastated, a large part of its remaining conserved area is inhabited by traditional communities. This research focused on two Quilombola communities who reside within the Núcleo Picinguaba of the Serra do Mar State Park, State of São Paulo, Brazil. The objective was to use a combination of ethnoecological and ecological approaches to select priority species for which to develop participatory conservation and sustainable management plans in protected areas in Brazil. We collaborated with community members to collect ethnobotanical and ethnoecological data and then measured the abundance of native species in local forests through phytosociological sampling. We used this information to assess the degree of threat to useful species using the Conservation Priority Index, adding an additional layer of analysis based on habitat successional categories. We then overlayed those useful species identified as highest risk locally with those federally listed as threatened or endangered. Based on this, we identified three species as priority for the development of sustainable management plans: Virola bicuhyba, Cedrella fissilis and Plinia edulis. © 2020 Conde et al.

Association of Suicide Risk with Transition to Civilian Life among US Military Service Members,"Ravindran, C.; Morley, S.W.; Stephens, B.M.; Stanley, I.H.; Reger, M.A.","Importance: Although interest is high in addressing suicide mortality after the transition from military to civilian life, little is known about the risk factors associated with this transition. To support the ongoing suicide surveillance work of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, examining these factors is important for targeting suicide prevention efforts. Objective: To examine the prevalence, patterns, and associated characteristics of suicide mortality among US service members after separation from military active status. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective population-based cohort study obtained demographic and military service data from the VA/Department of Defense Identity Repository. Individuals who served on active duty in the US Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard after September 11, 2001, and who separated from active status between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017, were included in the cohort. Data analyses were conducted from September 9, 2019, to April 1, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Suicide mortality within 6 years after separation from military service. Results: A total of 1868970 service members (1 572523 men [84.1%]; mean [SD] age at separation, 30.9 [9.9] years) separated from the military during the study period. Through the end of the study period (December 31, 2017), 3030 suicides (2860 men and 170 women) were identified as having occurred within 6 years of separation from the military. Statistically significant differences in suicide risk were found by demographic and military service characteristics. Suicide rates after separation were time dependent, generally peaking 6 to 12 months after separation and declining only modestly over the study period. Male service members had a statistically significantly higher hazard of suicide than their female counterparts (hazard ratio [HR], 3.13; 95% CI, 2.68-3.69). Younger individuals (aged 17-19 years; HR, 4.46 [95% CI, 3.71-5.36]) had suicide hazard rates that were approximately 4.5 times higher than those who transitioned at an older age (≥40 years). Service branch remained a risk factor for suicide even 6 years after separation; those who separated from the Marine Corps (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.36-1.78) and the Army (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.31-1.67) had a higher hazard than those who transitioned from the Air Force. The hazard for those who separated from the active component was higher than for those who separated from the reserve component (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.18-1.42). Service members with a shorter length of service had a higher hazard (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.11-1.42) than those with a longer service history. Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study show that not all service members who recently transitioned from military life had the same risk of suicide. The data suggest that awareness of military service and demographic characteristics can help identify those most at risk for suicide to target prevention efforts. © 2020 American Medical Association.

Fisher's perceptions about a marine protected area over time,"Pita, C.; Horta e Costa, B.; Franco, G.; Coelho, R.; Sousa, I.; Gonçalves, E.J.; Gonçalves, J.M.S.; Erzini, K.","The perceptions of fishers towards the Arrábida Marine Park, a marine protected area (MPA) in the west coast of Portugal, were studied through face-to-face interviews in two different moments of the MPA life cycle. Fishers' perceptions about the MPA and the impact it had on the fishing activity over time were identified just before the full implementation of the zoning and regulations of the management plan and 10 years later. This study aimed to investigate fishers' knowledge, acceptance and perceptions about the MPA changed with time, if support for the MPA was linked to the impact of the MPA on the fishing activity, and if fishers' perceptions about the impact of the MPA on the fishing activity match with local landings trends. Results show that although knowledge about the marine park significantly improved over time, fishers' acceptance did not. A decrease on fishers' support was not substantial but occurred. Issues such as the disagreement with regulations reinforced concerns raised during the implementation of the marine park, particularly in relation to the top-down decision-making, which commonly confers minor participation, recognition and legitimacy to fishers. Apparently, fisheries benefits were still not perceived by local fishers, though they are central for fishers' support. Further, the perceived negative impacts of the park seemed to be more related to social aspects and individual interests than to impacts on catches. Addressing adequate management, enforcement and participation of local fishers is still possible and are advocated here as to contribute to the expected socioecological outcomes and respective support, leading to the future successful performance of the Arrábida Marine Park. Assessing fishers’ perceptions towards an MPA over time is central and should be included on periodical socioecological monitoring and inform an effective adaptive management. © 2020 Shanghai Ocean University",2020,,Aquaculture and Fisheries,5,5,273-281,,10.1016/j.aaf.2020.01.005,,#20612,Pita 2020,,
"Locally managed marine areas: Implications for socio-economic impacts in Kadavu, Fiji","Robertson, T.; Greenhalgh, S.; Korovulavula, I.; Tikoibua, T.; Radikedike, P.; Stahlmann-Brown, P.","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a widely used marine conservation tool designed to preserve marine biodiversity and improve fisheries management. Although the environmental benefits of MPAs are well established, evaluating the social and economic impacts of MPAs is challenging. In this paper we quantitatively identify the economic and social differences between communities based on whether or not the community has a tabu area in their local fishing ground. This is an area permanently closed to fishing within a locally managed marine area (LMMA), a form of MPA in the Pacific region. To do this we analyse survey data at both the household and village level in Kadavu, an administrative province of Fiji. We find there are differences in economic activity and diet between the communities but little difference in overall income and wealth. Our study shows that villages with an active tabu area have more positive social outcomes in terms of perceptions of LMMAs. However, there are some notable negative social outcomes as well. In particular, we find that households not engaged in commercial fishing perceive conflict around the management of marine resources. We also find that households engaged in commercial fishing believe penalties for violating LMMA rules are high. Together, these results could potentially impede the adoption of LMMAs and tabu areas. Overall, our survey results do not indicate that tabu areas are detrimental or beneficial on the whole, either economically and socially. © 2020 The Authors",2020,,Marine Policy,117,,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.103950,,#20622,Robertson 2020,,
"The biodiversity of fishes at the islas marías biosphere reserve, mexico, as determined by baited remote underwater video ","Tholan, B.; Carlson, P.; Tortolero-Langarica, J.J.A.; Ketchum, J.T.; Trejo-Ramírez, A.; Aceves-Bueno, E.; Caselle, J.E.","The Islas Marías Biosphere Reserve, made up of 4 islands in Pacific waters off central Mexico, supports a large diversity of marine life. However, scientific research was restricted for decades by the occupation of Isla María Madre by the Federal Penitentiary Colony of Mexico from 1905 to 2019. Aside from a list of coastal fish species published in 2011, little has been published about the fish biodiversity in the area. While the limited access to the archipelago may have acted as a de-facto marine reserve, there is evidence that fishing continued both legally for the benefit of the colony and illegally by trespassing vessels. In order to establish baseline ecological data for future conservation planning, we used baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys at all 4 islands during 3 expeditions to the archipelago in 2018. A total of 131 BRUV surveys representing ~150 h of footage were analyzed to create the most current compilation of species and abundance data on coastal marine fishes at Islas Marías. Ninety-nine species were identified, 3 of which were additions to the previous assessment. We found strong separation of fish communities based on both habitat and depth, and an association between hard-bottom habitats and high biodiversity of reef fishes. With the declaration of Islas Marías as a natural reserve and relocation of the prison in 2019, there is an opportunity for the reserve to become a priority area for marine conservation on the Pacific coast of Mexico.

"Management and restoration of dune lakes in Veracruz, Gulf of Mexico","Peralta-Peláez, L.A.; Moreno-Casasola, P.; Neri-Flores, I.","Dune lakes are formed in coastal dune depressions. A group of dune lakes in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, was decreed a Ramsar site and/or a state natural reserve. The objective of this study was to characterize and determine a baseline for these water bodies, both urban and rural, comparing them and establishing the guidelines for their management. The study points out the different threats and actual conditions of rural and urban dunelakes and the need for specific management practices. Our hypothesis stated that human activities around these lakes have an important impact and modify water quality, and that contact with the water table acts as a passive means of restoration. The water of 25 lakes was sampled to determine its quality, and wetland vegetation cover was monitored over time. Water quality was the main difference between urban and rural dune lakes; the latter, surrounded by cattle ranching activities and plantations, have lower concentrations of nitrates, ammonium, orthophosphates and total phosphorus. For management purposes, the lakes were divided into three groups (with subgroups) depending on their water quality, whether they are urban or rural, their size, whether or not they form part of the Ramsar site and/or natural reserve, or lie within the range of expansion of the Port of Veracruz.

Developing a fisheries management plan for the Pitcairn Islands marine reserve,"Dawson, T.P.; Irving, R.A.","The Pitcairn Islands are the last remaining Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom in the Pacific Ocean and are extremely remote, located in the central South Pacific approximately equidistant between Chile and New Zealand. The Territory consists of four widely-separated small islands, only one of which, Pitcairn itself, is inhabited. Along with many other Small Island Developing States (SIDS), Pitcairn shares significant challenges that present a special case within the world community. These include isolation and a lack of economy of scale, exacerbated by high transportation and communication costs. Considering these challenges, the UK Darwin Initiative recently funded a project to develop local capacity for adaptive fisheries management and to enhance tourism opportunities through the visits of cruise ships and the development of associated on-island facilities. Following the establishment of the Pitcairn Islands Marine Reserve in September 2016, which covers the whole of the Pitcairn Island Exclusive Economic Zone (an area of 836,000km2), the key aim of the project was to mobilise community participation with a focus on introducing sustainable fisheries practices. Considering limited funds, resources and on-island capacity to implement monitoring, policing and enforcement of legislation, the establishment of a Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA) scheme was viewed as the most appropriate way forward to ensure high levels of compliance at minimum costs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"A new perspective on marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ): Making use of area-based management tools (ABMTs), including marine protected areas (MPAs)","Liao, J.; Huang, H.; Li, W.; Wang, L.; An, L.","With the increasing exploitation of marine biodiversity, conservation is facing several challenges. The Intergovernmental Conference to create an international legally binding instrument (ILBI) under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) was convened. They aimed to address the gap between conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. One of the core talking points of the ILBI, area-based management tools (ABMTs), including marine protected areas (MPAs), were widely recognized as a key mechanism for conserving and restoring biodiversity. Though the process of creating the ILBI is still in its early stages, there has been a lack of common understanding among United Nations (UN) member states regarding the elements of this new protocol. Thus, here we analyze the differences and commonalities of definitions and objectives from the UNCLOS, as well as other instruments and frameworks, relevant global, regional and sectoral bodies, general principles and approaches, current legal and policy frameworks, technological challenges and stakeholder engagement. Our recommendations to increase understanding of ABMTs/MPAs include improving the scientificity of establishing MPAs, establishing effective monitoring and enforcement mechanisms and strengthening international cooperation for the establishment of ABMTs/MPAs in areas beyond national jurisdiction. © 2019, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

"Tourism and poverty: Perspectives and experiences of local residents in Cu Lao Cham MPA, Vietnam","Nguyen, V.H.","Although the tourism-poverty nexus has received increased attention, limited research considers the perspectives of people residing (with)in marine protected areas (MPAs). This article examines the views and experiences of local people in Cu Lao Cham MPA, Vietnam, with regard to tourism and poverty alleviation. Participant observation and semistructured interviews were conducted with 41 local people working in tourism. Results suggest that most respondents are involved in tourism and fishery simultaneously. Although tourism contributes significantly to respondents' living conditions and to the local economy overall (e.g., jobs creation for poor people and women), benefits are distributed unequally, which increases social conflicts. The challenges facing local people in participating in tourism include a lack of capital, lack of market access, and obstacles caused by local policies. This research suggests that locals' perceptions of tourism are important criteria for evaluating the tourism-poverty alleviation nexus. Additionally, in the context of MPAs, local attitudes may have an effect on conservation outcomes. Further research should consider the wider views of local people and other tourism stakeholders with regard to tourism, poverty, and conservation. © 2019 Cognizant, LLC.",2019,,Tourism in Marine Environments,14,3,179-197,,10.3727/154427319X15631036242632,,#20687,Nguyen 2019,,
What values do tourists place on a marine protected area? White shark cage-dive tourists and the Neptune Islands,"Apps, K.; Dimmock, K.; Lloyd, D.J.; Huveneers, C.","Management of protected areas is as much about understanding how society values these resources as it is about understanding ecological processes. Yet, in comparison to standard ecosystem monitoring and economic evaluation, social values are frequently overlooked because of the challenge to measure and define them. As marine protected areas are currently the fastest growing protected area type, this article argues the need to incorporate social value assessment in planning and policy decisions to improve ecological and social outcomes. This study surveyed 675 white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) cage-dive participants to investigate how tourists' value the Neptune Islands group (Ron and Valerie Taylor) Marine Park. Applying a value typology previously used in forests, respondents were able to identify with 13 distinct values.

"Estimating the conservation value of mangrove forests in marine protected areas: Special reference to karimunjawa waters, Indonesia","Ardiansyah, M.; Suharno; Susilowati, I.","Indonesia has seven marine national parks, one of which is Karimunjawa National Park in Central Java. The IUCN has defined it by as a Marine Protected Area (MPA)-Category II. As the 6th largest marine park in Indonesia, Karimunjawa provides a variety of coastal and marine habitats. Mangrove forest is one of the critical ecosystems in MPA Karimunjawa. This area offers a range of services both ecologically and economically. The high level of overexploitation activities, such as timber theft and tourism could damage the preservation of mangrove forests in Karimunjawa as a marine conservation area now and in the future. Thus, proven mangrove forest management is required to ensure its sustainability, and it depends on how people value conservation from economic and environmental considerations. The objectives of this research are to estimate the conservation value of mangrove forest in Kemujan Island – Karimunjawa and to estimate the community participation towards the conservation of mangrove forest in Kemujan Island – Karimunjawa. Based on the mangrove inventory on Kemujan Island by BTNKJ, there are 25 mangrove species in the category of seeds, stakes, and trees. The willingness to pay of the community in the context of MPA Karimunjawa conservation is regulated by developing a hypothetical market consisting of four actions: inventory, monitoring, core zone tracking technical plan, and restoration. The total economic value of willingness to pay in preserving Karimunjawa National Park is Rp 440,813,000.00, with a population of 9,379 visitors in MPA Karimunjawa is calculated around Rp 47,000.00 WTP average value. © 2019, BIOFLUX SRL.

Where will threatened migratory birds go under climate change? Implications for China's national nature reserves,"Liang, J.; Xing, W.; Zeng, G.; Li, X.; Peng, Y.; Gao, X.; He, X.","Climate change, regarded as one of the major threats to biodiversity and ecosystems, can impact on the distribution and survival of migratory birds. To investigate the threats of climate change to threatened migratory bird distributions, we used species distribution model (SDM) and climatic data under current and future climate scenarios to predict future changes in species distributions and how the geographic distribution of these threatened birds may respond to climate change by 2050. Our results show the hotspots for all species may remain in the lower and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, while more species may dwell in the coastal regions of the Bohai Gulf and the Yellow Sea in the future. Our findings show that the percentage of all species distributions or hotspots for all threatened species covered by national nature reserves (NNRs) in China remain low by 2050. Thus, we propose that China should increase and expand reserves in eastern China. Significantly, we emphasize the creation of protected areas to make it the Ramsar sites in the world and recommend that China should (1) strengthen the cooperation with neighboring countries to share maximum species occurrence data (especially the threatened species), (2) overlay maps of individual species for each taxon to assess the efficiency of coastal nature reserves and predict the hotspots shift under climate change, (3) trade off urban development and ecosystem stability to create new and dynamic protected areas to make it the Ramsar sites, (4) appeal for long-term protection of ecosystem stability to achieve sustainable development in the world. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2018,,Science of the Total Environment,645,,1040-1047,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.196,,#20695,Liang 2018,,
Community responses to flood risk management – An empirical Investigation of the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Malaysia,"Masud, M.M.; Sackor, A.S.; Ferdous Alam, A.S.A.; Al-Amin, A.Q.; Abdul Ghani, A.B.","The vulnerability of the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to flood disasters affects not only the underlying eco-centric and anthropocentric values therein, but also the coastal communities that are adjacent to the MPAs. The consequences can lead to economic, social and environmental degradation. As such, the perception of the coastal communities about flood risk occurrences and their effects on the MPAs are crucial for Flood Risk Management (FRM) exercises. Having an insight into the perceptions of the coastal communities about the build-up of flood risk analysis adds robustness to the FRM cycle as it can increase levels of preparedness, responses and recoveries. This paper examines the relationship between the communities’ perceived vulnerability, perceived severity of flood risks, perceived benefits of flood risk management, perceived barriers of flood management and their previous experience of flood risk management. The paper seeks to understand how this intersection influences the human intention to participate in the preventive and precautionary measures related to flood risks in MPAs. To achieve the objectives, a survey questionnaire was conducted on a sample of 320 households from MPAs in Malaysia. Data were analysed using the structural equation modelling (SEM). This study revealed that perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and previous flood risk experience have a positive and significant influence on the intention to participate in prevention activities. This study offers valuable insights that may be useful for policymakers in promoting greater public engagement in managing climatic disasters including potential flood risks in MPAs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Marine Policy,97,,119-126,,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.08.027,,#20707,Masud 2018,,
Stakeholder perception of coral reef management policy implementation along the eastern coast of Thailand,"Siriwong, S.; True, J.D.","Coral reef-related tourism contributes to economic development and strengthens local community livelihood opportunities; however, it is not environmentally neutral, and it needs an integration of policy and management actions to harmonize tourism benefits and coral reef health. Thailand is among the top tourism destinations in the world, and the east coast has experienced a doubling of tourism activity in the past decade. A socio-ecological study explored the perceptions of stakeholders concerning coral reef management policy implementation in Marine Protected Areas in the Eastern Coast of Thailand. Coral reef managers and users were interviewed about their perceptions of the planning, process and outcome of coral reef management policy and regulations. Users largely felt that they were left out of the decision process in coral reef management and they are unlikely to participate in conservation activity because of the lack of communication between managers and users. The adversarial perceptions between managers and users possibly undermine the success of coral reef management. Managers perceived gaps between institutional policies and implementation priorities, which frequently deprioritized conservation. This study suggests that success of marine resource management needs comprehensive policy together with close communication between managers and end users to get strong support from local communities. © 2018, Faculty of Fisheries, Kasetsart University.

"Skipjack (Katsuwonuspelamis) fishery improvement project: From satellite and 3D oceanographic models to acoustics, towards predator-prey landscapes","Madureira, L.S.P.; Coletto, J.L.; Pinho, M.P.; Weigert, S.C.; Varela, C.M.; Campello, M.E.S.; Llopart, A.","Tuna are an important source of food and protein. Among this group of fishes, seven species represent 90% of the global catches and the main species is the skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) with a total production of over three million ton. We worked on a Skipjack Fishery Improvement Project in the Brazilian Coast in order to increase efficiency of the pole and line catch method, considered a sustainable mode to catch these fishes. We started with satellite images and 3D models to identity more productive fishing grounds, associated to enrichment oceanographic processes. At the same time, we recorded environmental conditions at the position of 3,410 catch records and learned more about skipjack preferences in order to improve further our searching skills. After a long series of at lab observation, we participated on a fishing cruise when it was possible to observe skipjack catches and echo records. Due to the strength of these echo records and because skipjack is a bladderless fish we investigated stomach content of fresh fish, full of fresh prey. Skipjack stomachs contained large amounts of small lantern fish and euphausiids. Lantern fishes have swimbladers and euphausiids have oil droplets as energy reserves. We then suggest that skipjack target strength may be different depending on the stage of stomach fullness. Our previous experience in the skipjack distribution area, when we could use more sophisticated echosounders than the one we had on board the fishing vessel, showed that lantern fish and euphausiids can be quite easily detected. Modern multi-frequencies echosounders like SIMRAD EK 80 generate digital water column echograms as well as virtual echograms. If we can identify predator and/or prey acoustically it is possible to generate predator-prey landscapes along the surveyed areas. Virtual echograms with ideal frequencies to each type of target may also generate virtual predator prey landscapes. Monitoring more efficiently predator and prey patches may improve catch efficiency and save fossil fuel reducing CO2 emissions. © 2017 IEEE.",2018,,,2018-January,,7-Jan,,10.1109/RIOAcoustics.2017.8349755,,#20725,Madureira 2018,,
"The SOS pesca project: A multinational and intersectoral collaboration for sustainable fisheries, Marine conservation and improved quality of life in coastal communities","Miller, V.; Mirabal-Patterson, A.; García-Rodríguez, E.; Karr, K.; Whittle, D.","Healthy fisheries, particularly small-scale fisheries, are closely linked to prosperous and healthy coastal communities and resilient marine environments. Cuba’s marine and coastal ecosystems are highly biodiverse and support fisheries vital to food security and the national economy. Cuban government and state institutions, scientists, managers and fishers—along with colleagues from other countries—have expressed growing concern about the decline of fishing resources. In 2012, under the aegis of the National Center for Protected Areas, Cuban institutions from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment and the Ministry of Foreign Investment partnered with the Italian nongovernmental organization, COSPE Onlus, to launch SOS Pesca, a four-year project to achieve sustainable fisheries management, conserve marine habitats and improve quality of life in two Cuban fishing communities (Guayabal in Las Tunas Province and Playa Florida in Camagüey Province). SOS Pesca involved the municipal governments of Amancio Rodríguez (in Las Tunas Province) and Florida (in Camagüey Province), delegates to the Municipal Assembly of People’s Power (municipal government) from Guayabal (Amancio Rodríguez Municipality) and Playa Florida (Florida Municipality), the state-owned fishing industry, private fishers, local families, protected area officials and staff scientists, municipal governments and international nongovernmental organizations. By the end of 2012, a new US–Cuban collaboration emerged when COSPE recruited Environmental Defense Fund to provide scientific and technical support, trainings and exchanges focused on fisheries. SOS Pesca succeeded at community, regional fishing zone and national levels. Outcomes included: an assessment of finfish identifying species most vulnerable to fishing (methods and capacities), a proposed management plan for finfish, a National Plan of Action for sharks and rays, two marine protected areas established, increased employment through socioeconomic alternatives, revitalization of community environmental brigades, and greater capacity to use fishery assessment methods and develop management strategies. Perhaps the greatest achievement was communities’ and fishers’ changed perceptions of their marine environment, the need for conservation and sustainable resource management, and their active role in this objective. SOS Pesca spurred a more participatory form of integrated marine and coastal management in Cuba—one that integrates fisheries and spatial management, links fishing families and coastal communities with scientists and administrators to find solutions that support sustainability, and connects economic alternatives to community-based conservation and improved food security. This innovative multinational collaboration benefited coastal communities, marine and coastal ecosystems and international cooperation. © 2018 MEDICC Medical Education Cooperation with Cuba.

Development and initial validation of the Retrospective Indigenous Childhood Enrichment scale (RICE),"Minogue, C.; Delbaere, K.; Radford, K.; Broe, T.; Forder, W.S.; Lah, S.","Background: Years of education is the most commonly used proxy measure of cognitive reserve. Other forms of cognitive stimulation in childhood may provide similar protection against cognitive decline, particularly in Indigenous groups, where education may have been lacking in quality or quantity. The Retrospective Indigenous Childhood Enrichment (RICE) scale was developed to measure non-school-based activities and environmental stimulation during childhood that are likely to have enhanced cognitive reserve. The aim of the study was to assess the validity and reliability of the RICE scale with a group of older Aboriginal Australians.Methods: 294 Aboriginal Australian people (60-92 years), living in urban or regional areas of NSW, completed the RICE scale as part of a longer face-to-face interview. Additional data was collected on their formal education, childhood environment, and childhood trauma (Study 1). Test-retest, inter-method and inter-rater reliability were assessed in a convenience sample of a further 38 participants by re-administration of the RICE scale at two time points, approximately 14 days apart (M = 14.11, SD = 6.78) (Study 2).Results: Factor analyses reduced the scale from 21 items to 18 and identified three factors: (1) Traditional, (2) Intellectual, and (3) Community. Higher scores on the RICE scale were related to higher years of formal education and lower scores on a childhood trauma questionnaire. The RICE scale had good internal consistency (Cronbach's α 0.79), and excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.95, 95% CI 0.90-0.97) and inter-rater reliability (0.99, CI 95% 0.997-0.999).Conclusions: The RICE is, to our knowledge, the first standardized measure that assesses the level of childhood environmental stimulation in older Aboriginal Australians. This could provide an important supplementary measure, in addition to formal education, to investigate cognitive reserve and dementia risk in this population and enhance understanding of the links between childhood experiences and late-life cognitive decline.

Managing Biodiversity beyond National Jurisdiction in the Changing Arctic,"Caddell, R.","The development of an Internationally Binding Legal Instrument (ILBI) for the conservation and sustainable management of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) has profound implications for the future regulatory activities of a host of regional governance structures exercising competence over these waters. In the rather stilted vernacular of the BBNJ Process, the ILBI aspires to not undermine the work of preexisting institutions and initiatives. Inevitably, given the emphasis upon future institutional symbiosis, a key challenge facing the ILBI is to promote its four thematic priorities - marine genetic resources, area-based management tools, environmental assessment, and capacity building and technology transfer - in a manner that can be effectively harnessed by current regional and sectoral frameworks. One region in which the intriguing set of challenges and opportunities presented by the ILBI are strikingly manifested is the Arctic. Some have argued for a regional treaty or clearer recognition of the special nature of Arctic conditions. However, we view the ILBI as a potential milestone in Arctic governance that can provide a firm platform to build on current cooperative arrangements for these vulnerable and rapidly changing marine ecosystems. Moreover, we argue that the present legal and institutional framework for the Arctic need not be revisited at this juncture, as it provides a strong regime through which to implement the core objectives of the ILBI. Its ability to do so, however, will depend on whether the ILBI (1) is effectively designed to work with preexisting machinery and (2) succeeds in clarifying and advancing universally-agreed methodological requirements for its four priority areas.

Marine Technology Transfer under a BBNJ Treaty: A Case for Transnational Network Cooperation,"Minas, S.","Our ability to protect and sustainably use the high seas is ultimately subject to our ability to understand this vast and remote environment. The success of an international legally binding instrument (ILBI) for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) will depend, in part, on utilizing technology to access ocean life, to analyze it, and to implement measures for its conservation and sustainable use. Indeed, technology, broadly defined, is integral to meeting the ILBI's objectives: not just the mandate to address capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology, but also the sustainable use and conservation of marine genetic resources, the implementation of environmental impact assessments, and biodiversity conservation measures such as area-based management tools. To maximize marine technology deployment to protect marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, transferring technology to developing countries will be critical. Provisions for the transfer of technology, generally from developed to developing countries, are included in many international environmental agreements and declarations, but these provisions have often proven difficult to implement. Part of the difficulty is that the relevant technology is dispersed among states; universities, research institutes and other nonstate actors; and private industry. The particular challenge in crafting an ILBI is, as the European Union has identified, to avoid repeating existing provisions and instead to focus on added value. One opportunity for an ILBI to add value on technology transfer is to further develop a network model to facilitate marine technology transfer.

Consideration regarding policy and environmental legislation concerning biodiversity and protected areas in romania,"Popescu, G.C.; Popescu, M.","One of the most essential tools to protect nature, environment and biodiversity is to ensure the proper policy and environmental legislation in the creation of protected areas. Nowadays, green economy and environmentally friendly technologies play a major role for sustainable development. The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed picture of the Romanian policy and environmental legislation regarding biodiversity and protected areas and to outline the importance of the institutional framework, global approach of the environmental issues, international and European law and the legislation and policy of national state in order to promote the establishment of protected areas. In this work, we included a documentary synthesis and an analysis of legal and institutional frameworks for biodiversity and protected areas. Romania is the only state in the European Union having five biogeographical regions (alpine, Black sea, continental, steppic, pannonian). Taking in consideration that Romania has a rich biodiversity and more than 22% Romanian territory is under Natura 2000's ecological network, institutional framework, policy and environmental legislation are the most important instruments to protect species, habitats and ecosystems and to maintain biodiversity. In the last decade the terrestrial and marine protected areas has increasing mainly under the influence of European environmental directives. The Romanian Natura 2000 network is composed of 435 sites under the Habitats Directive (Sites of Community Importance, SCIs, and Special Areas of Conservation, SACs) and 171 sites under the Birds Directive (Special Protection Areas, SPAs). Romania currently counts 19 sites designated as Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Sites), with a surface area of 1,156,448 hectares and three Biosphere Reserves including the Danube Delta, Europe's largest natural wetland. As a European Union member, Romanian environment legislation and policy is strongly influence by European law. European legislation in the field of nature protection has been compatible at national level mainly with the adoption Government Emergency Ordinance no. 57/2007 on protected natural regimes, natural habitats, wild flora and wild fauna, approved with amendments by Law no. 49 of April 7, 2011. In order to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of nature in Romania through legal instruments is necessary to create: an institutional framework in line with the new environmental protection requirements; sustainable use of natural resources; access to financial support; monitoring, evaluation and control of activities with environmental impact; public–private partnership, institutional and cross-border cooperation. © 2018, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

Profiling scuba divers to assess their potential for the management of temperate marine protected areas: A conceptual model,"Lucrezi, S.; Milanese, M.; Sarà, A.; Palma, M.; Saayman, M.; Cerrano, C.","Scuba diving tourism may both positively and negatively affect the natural environment, as well as human economies and societies. Marine protected areas (MPAs) in particular attract scuba diving tourism. Even though the activities of scuba divers could conflict with the conservation agendas of MPAs, they also potentially could endorse and support the management of MPAs. Thus, depending on the types of interactions that develop between scuba diving tourism and MPAs, more or less rigid management actions may be required. Although studies in temperate locations are rare, there is evidence that scuba divers in these locations tend to be more experienced, knowledgeable about local issues, responsible towards the environment, and willing to participate in stewardship, compared with divers at tropical destinations. This study assessed the profile of scuba divers at a temperate MPA in Italy, to determine which types of diving management actions are needed, and to understand how the potential of scuba divers could be exploited for the management of temperate MPAs. Data on the profile of 279 scuba divers in the Portofino MPA, Italy, were collected during the summer of 2015. Scuba divers in Portofino are generally experienced, loyal, satisfied, aware of the code of underwater conduct, knowledgeable of ecosystems in the MPA, and willing to participate in marine conservation activities. Although some important considerations must be taken into account regarding the management of scuba diving activities, a case is made that scuba divers could exert many positive impacts on MPAs. A conceptual model of the conservation-oriented behavior of scuba divers and its impacts both inside and outside MPAs is proposed. The positive messages and actions of scuba divers inside MPAs appear to exert potentially positive effects on other diving destinations outside the MPAs. © 2018 Cognizant, LLC.",2018,,Tourism in Marine Environments,13,3-Feb,85-108,,10.3727/154427318X15225542424207,,#20743,Lucrezi 2018,,
"Natural gas hydrates to enable the safe, sustainable, and economical production of offshore petroleum reserves","Kezirian, M.T.; Phoenix, S.L.","This research presents a novel approach using Natural Gas Clathrate Hydrates (NGH) for the production of natural gas from deep-water petroleum reserves. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) has limitations associated with its enormous capital cost (requiring significant production capacity), inherent hazards, and environmental impact. Storage and transport of natural gas must address the economic, safety and environmental requirements, as a whole, by designing the supply chain as an end-to-end process. The solution is the production of NGH at depths where the in situ pressure and temperature inherently favor the formation in situ, based on thermodynamics and kinetics. The remaining system is then created in order to manage these products. The engineering design, safety analysis and business case are assessed concurrently in order to optimize the system and meet all of the requirements. Containment technology, originating from space exploration, is adapted so that it will be strong, durable, flexible and lightweight. The processing rate and dimensional parameters are selected to mitigate system losses and energy dissipation during long distance ocean transport. The resulting proposed process is economically assessed to be significantly cheaper for the production of natural gas. It can be applied for small production rates and replace operations which flare gas byproducts. Theoretically, it could be scaled for the production of large natural gas fields. The proposed system presents an inherently safer system as the hazards inherent with compressed natural gas (CNG), LNG and pipeline are eliminated by design. There is no handling of compressed or cryogenically cooled fluids, and the transfer from platform to carrier is eliminated. Consistent with the industry direction to move crude oil processing to the bottom of the ocean, the new process can be managed autonomously and avoid the hazards associated with adverse weather conditions. A resulting by-product from this new process is significantly-desalinated water originating in the deep ocean away from man-made pollutants. It is proposed that this by-product can either be post- processed to yield potable water or used as-is, replacing consumption of local resources. The proposed system can be utilized to produce natural gas reserves which would otherwise be considered as stranded reserves. It can serve markets which are too small or ports are too shallow to handle the delivery of LNG from standard carriers. A Patent Cooperation Treaty application on this proposed method was filed and received a favorable preliminary review by the United States Patent and Trademark Office; claims were found to be novel and useful.

Tools and methods to support adaptive policy making in marine areas: Review and implementation of the Adaptive Marine Policy Toolbox,"Furlan, E.; Torresan, S.; Ronco, P.; Critto, A.; Breil, M.; Kontogianni, A.; Garmendia, M.; Pascual, M.; Sauzade, D.; Skourtos, M.; Marcomini, A.","The development of adaptive policies for the management of dynamic and complex ecosystems, such as marine and coastal environments, asks for flexible and innovative tools which account for multifaceted issues, uncertainties and cope with a wide range of future conditions. To date, several tools and methods to support the design and implementation of adaptive policies have been developed by the research community (e.g. data processing and management, stakeholder analysis and participatory methods, numerical and simulation models, assessment approaches). The paper proposes a (four) step-wise methodology to review, analyze, classify and select existing tools dealing with social, economic and environmental issues. Firstly, existing toolboxes were retrieved. Secondly, an in-depth analysis was performed to classify their potential for the development and implementation of adaptive policies in marine areas. Thirdly, selected tools were included in the ‘Database of tools and methods’ of the wider Adaptive Marine Policy Tool Box, designed within the EU-FP7 PERSEUS project (Policy-oriented Environmental Research in Southern European Seas) to support policy makers with the application of an Adaptive Policy Framework. Finally, a review process was performed based on several qualitative criteria and expert judgment, which allowed to identify a set of valuable ‘flag tools’ useful to implement each step of the Adaptive Policy Framework. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Ocean and Coastal Management,151,,25-35,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2017.10.029,,#20748,Furlan 2018,,
Landscape capability models as a tool to predict fine-scale forest bird occupancy and abundance,"Loman, Z.G.; Deluca, W.V.; Harrison, D.J.; Loftin, C.S.; Rolek, B.W.; Wood, P.B.","Context: Species-specific models of landscape capability (LC) can inform landscape conservation design. Landscape capability is “the ability of the landscape to provide the environment […] and the local resources […] needed for survival and reproduction […] in sufficient quantity, quality and accessibility to meet the life history requirements of individuals and local populations.” Landscape capability incorporates species’ life histories, ecologies, and distributions to model habitat for current and future landscapes and climates as a proactive strategy for conservation planning. Objectives: We tested the ability of a set of LC models to explain variation in point occupancy and abundance for seven bird species representative of spruce-fir, mixed conifer-hardwood, and riparian and wooded wetland macrohabitats. Methods: We compiled point count data sets used for biological inventory, species monitoring, and field studies across the northeastern United States to create an independent validation data set. Our validation explicitly accounted for underestimation in validation data using joint distance and time removal sampling. Results: Blackpoll warbler (Setophaga striata), wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), and Louisiana (Parkesia motacilla) and northern waterthrush (P. noveboracensis) models were validated as predicting variation in abundance, although this varied from not biologically meaningful (1%) to strongly meaningful (59%). We verified all seven species models [including ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), blackburnian (Setophaga fusca) and cerulean warbler (Setophaga cerulea)], as all were positively related to occupancy data. Conclusions: LC models represent a useful tool for conservation planning owing to their predictive ability over a regional extent. As improved remote-sensed data become available, LC layers are updated, which will improve predictions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",2018,,Landscape Ecology,33,1,77-91,,10.1007/s10980-017-0582-z,,#20749,Loman 2018,,
“Face-to-Face with the caracara”: A proposal to reconnect people and nature using birding ,"Cristóbal Pizarro, J.; Rau, J.; Anderson, C.B.","Outdoor recreational practices reflect the diverse ways of living together with biodiversity. One of these practices, birdwatching or birding, has gained world-wide popularity, favouring the socializing of people and nature through birds. Birding also can promote an ethical relationship with birds, people and their culture. In this work, we present “biocultural birding” as a theoretical–practical proposal to enrich birding ethics using ecological and cultural narratives associated with birds in an observation–reflection cycle. We integrate interdisciplinary research with metaphor composition and guided birdwatching activities in Puerto Williams, Chile. The Chimango Caracara (Milvago chimango) is capable of linking ecological and social systems in the Southern Cone. We communicate these findings using the metaphors “marine-terrestrial link” and “face-to-face with the caracara”, which we constructed based on ecological research and Emmanuel Lévinas’ expression “face-to-face”. Using the criteria of referential, social, environmental and sustainability adequacy, we evaluated how these metaphors bring together participants and birds, their ecosystems and the cultures in which they participate. We recommend to adapt this proposal with other birds and contexts, as a way to diversify human–nature relationships and promote respect for birds and cultures in socio-ecological systems. © 2017, Association Ornitologica del Plata.

Drivers and implications of change in global ocean health over the past five years,"Halpern, B.S.; Frazier, M.; Afflerbach, J.; O’Hara, C.; Katona, S.; Stewart Lowndes, J.S.; Jiang, N.; Pacheco, E.; Scarborough, C.; Polsenberg, J.","Growing international and national focus on quantitatively measuring and improving ocean health has increased the need for comprehensive, scientific, and repeated indicators to track progress towards achieving policy and societal goals. The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is one of the few indicators available for this purpose. Here we present results from five years of annual global assessment for 220 countries and territories, evaluating potential drivers and consequences of changes and presenting lessons learned about the challenges of using composite indicators to measure sustainability goals. Globally scores have shown little change, as would be expected. However, individual countries have seen notable increases or declines due in particular to improvements in the harvest and management of wild-caught fisheries, the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs), and decreases in natural product harvest. Rapid loss of sea ice and the consequent reduction of coastal protection from that sea ice was also responsible for declines in overall ocean health in many Arctic and sub-Arctic countries. The OHI performed reasonably well at predicting near-term future scores for many of the ten goals measured, but data gaps and limitations hindered these predictions for many other goals. Ultimately, all indicators face the substantial challenge of informing policy for progress toward broad goals and objectives with insufficient monitoring and assessment data. If countries and the global community hope to achieve and maintain healthy oceans, we will need to dedicate significant resources to measuring what we are trying to manage. © 2017 Halpern et al.

"Proportions of social acceptance in the designation of a marine protected area: Cap de Garde in Annaba, Algeria (SW mediterranean)","Seridi, A.; Djebar, A.B.","The main mandate of Marine Protected Areas (MPA), defined by the conservation of biodiversity, marine resources and habitats, their creations must also have a positive impact on social conditions. The achievement of such objectives depends on the initial design process, hence the need to consult with the local community and stakeholders during all phases of the design of the MPA. In the Mediterranean the MPA have shown their capabilities to provide a variety of benefits, hence the perpetual growth of their numbers which reached 677 in 2012. However, their distribution is uneven between the two shores, 93.39% of them are located in the North against 6.61% in the South. Although Algeria has only two MPA, it attaches great importance to the protection of the environment with the ratification of several conventions, treaties and protocols, the most important of which is the commitment under the CBD. It is in this context of the establishment of MPAs that our study is aimed at analyzing the influence of users' knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and occupational factors on social acceptance to the proposal to create an MPA in the Cap de Garde region of Annaba on the Northeast Algerian coast (SW Mediterranean). This study examines the nature of the reactions of all users of the site, designated since 2005 by the United Nations Environment Program as Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMI). For this, 600 questionnaires were submitted to the public between June and August 2014, with a 73.3% response rate. While the results from a frequency analysis show that 81.6% of respondents are in favor of the project. The Pearson Chi-square test (χ²) and a classification analysis (direct marketing) allowed us to distinguish 3 socioprofessional profiles. The first profile is represented at 58.2% by male of university level, state officials, not practicing any extractive activity in the study area. The 2nd profile includes 100% of tourists, mostly university male from various professions. While the 3rd profile accounts for 13.2% of the respondents and is 100% of male practicing a profession related to the direct use of the marine environment, with a very low level of education. Public participation at such an early stage has allowed us to identify and quantify the degree of acceptance, as well as the interest of the community and users in protecting the marine area of the Cap de Garde in Annaba. © 2017, BIOFLUX SRL.

Gendering Marine Conservation: The Politics of Marine Protected Areas and Fisheries Access,"Baker-Médard, M.","Drawing on ethnographic case studies from Madagascar, this research shows that multiple marine conservation projects have institutionalized inequitable access to marine recourses along gendered lines. Despite discursive and institutional shifts toward more “collaborative” and “community-based” conservation programing, there is a deficiency of women’s nominal as well as effective participation in community management organizations. This research shows that conservation organizations’ focus on proximate drivers of marine resource use, or a politics of picking the “low-hanging fruit,” over ultimate drivers such as global commodity chains, places disproportionate emphasis on marine spatial enclosures and restricting specific, and gendered, harvest methods. To address gender bias concerning access to and control over natural resources, we must go beyond the rhetoric of “community involvement” to address gendered inequalities in conservation decision making, and whose interests are served by conservation projects. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",2017,,Society and Natural Resources,30,6,723-737,,10.1080/08941920.2016.1257078,,#20764,Baker-Médard 2017,,
Optimization of waste management scenarios by principal component analysis: A case study in Reunion Island,"Hatik, C.; Gatina, J.-C.","Knowledge of waste composition and production is a requirement to build an efficient waste management scenario. Moreover, analysis of this data at a detailed level of observation (regional or communal) is useful to create adapted local scenarios, thus optimizing the overall waste management. However, working at a detailed level of observation multiplies the number of scenarios to build. In this article, we make use of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to identify similarities between local administrative areas. This simple method is directly based on the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of wastes at the desired level of observation. The PCA provides an optimal two-dimensional or three-dimensional graph on which all the administrative areas are classified. The axes are based on the waste characteristics that are the most discrimining in the dataset. So, two administrative areas close the one from another in the graph have similar waste production. By grouping administrative areas based on their waste production, this analysis is an efficient way to drastically reduce the number of local waste management scenarios to define and it also favorizes cooperation among administrative areas of the same group. To illustrate our methodology, we focus on the specific case of biowaste of Reunion Island. Reunion Island is a French oversea territory of approximately 2500 square miles, located in the Indian Ocean, and composed of 24 municipalities. Waste are managed by the Regional Council (Conseil Régional) at the island-scale. With landfills having reached their maximal capacity and an ever-growing population, the waste management scenario must be revised. An optimal global scenario is particularly difficult to build due to the specificities of biowaste composition and production of each municipality. Indeed, coastal municipalities are urbanized and developed whereas the one in the highlands are more rural, specialized on crop and breeding. These differences motivate the definition of biowaste management scenarios at the municipality scale, thus facing the creation of 24 local scenarios. The PCA analysis enabled to identify 5 groups of municipalities, thus reducing the number of required scenarios to build drastically. Through the example of Reunion Island, we demonstrate effectiveness of PCA analysis to identify biowaste composition and production patterns among different administrative areas. One of the assets of PCA is the fact that it features graphical representation of the dataset, enabling anyone to visualize correlation existing between the different administrative areas. Principal Components Analysis of biowastes production can then be used for different purposes: biowaste management scenarios pooling, cooperation among administrative authorities, location and optimization of waste treatment plants, and more generally waste management decision-making. © 2018, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

Energy transitions and trade law: lessons from the reform of fisheries subsidies,"Young, M.A.","Fossil fuel subsidies, like subsidies to the fishing sector, lead to trade-distorting and ecologically harmful practices. The US$35 billion in subsidies provided by countries every year to the fishing sector leads to more and more boats being built, even as 90% of fish stocks are either fully exploited or overfished. An estimated US$444 billion in subsidies are provided annually for the production of fossil fuels by G20 countries, even as evidence emerges that oil, gas and coal reserves must remain unexploited to limit global warming increases to 2 °C. Of course, each country has its own development priorities, livelihood concerns and need for food and energy security. Agreeing upon subsidy reform is a complex undertaking that requires the assessment of social, political and historical considerations, as well as the involvement of international and transnational legal regimes that govern climate change, energy, fisheries and trade. This article reviews proposals for reform within the World Trade Organization and regional trade agreements, including the new disciplines on fisheries subsidies that were endorsed in the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Although the latter agreement is unlikely to enter into force, consensus is emerging on the need to prohibit subsidies that contribute to overfishing or that are linked to illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing. The article shows how these legal developments might inform attempts to limit fossil fuel production and consumption subsidies. It highlights the need for learning and open deliberation about subsidy reform by affected stakeholders, including representatives from international organizations and civil society. It also points to new arrangements that link compliance with subsidy rules to standards and benchmarks from fisheries regimes, and demonstrates how such inter-regime connections are legitimate in the context of the fragmentation of international law. While reform to fisheries subsidies is still preliminary and fraught, there are useful lessons for the equally important project of energy transitions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",2017,,"International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics",17,3,371-390,,10.1007/s10784-017-9360-2,,#20768,Young 2017,,
A typology of fisheries management tools: using experience to catalyse greater success,"Selig, E.R.; Kleisner, K.M.; Ahoobim, O.; Arocha, F.; Cruz-Trinidad, A.; Fujita, R.; Hara, M.; Katz, L.; McConney, P.; Ratner, B.D.; Saavedra-Díaz, L.M.; Schwarz, A.-M.; Thiao, D.; Torell, E.; Troëng, S.; Villasante, S.","Fisheries provide nutrition and livelihoods for coastal populations, but many fisheries are fully or over-exploited and we lack an approach for analysing which factors affect management tool performance. We conducted a literature review of 390 studies to assess how fisheries characteristics affected management tool performance across both small-scale and large-scale fisheries. We defined success as increased or maintained abundance or biomass, reductions in fishing mortality or improvements in population status. Because the literature only covered a narrow set of biological factors, we also conducted an expert elicitation to create a typology of broader fishery characteristics, enabling conditions and design considerations that affect performance. The literature suggested that the most commonly used management tool in a region was often the most successful, although the scale of success varied. Management tools were more often deemed successful when used in combination, particularly pairings of tools that controlled fishing mortality or effort with spatial management. Examples of successful combinations were the use of catch limits with quotas and limited entry, and marine protected areas with effort restrictions. The most common factors associated with inadequate biological performance were ‘structural’ issues, including poor design or implementation. The expert-derived typologies revealed strong local leadership, high community involvement and governance capacity as common factors of success across management tool categories (i.e. input, output and technical measures), but the degree of importance varied. Our results are designed to inform selection of appropriate management tools based on empirical data and experience to increase the likelihood of successful fisheries management. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2017,,Fish and Fisheries,18,3,543-570,,10.1111/faf.12192,,#20771,Selig 2017,,
Capacity shortfalls hinder the performance of marine protected areas globally,"Gill, D.A.; Mascia, M.B.; Ahmadia, G.N.; Glew, L.; Lester, S.E.; Barnes, M.; Craigie, I.; Darling, E.S.; Free, C.M.; Geldmann, J.; Holst, S.; Jensen, O.P.; White, A.T.; Basurto, X.; Coad, L.; Gates, R.D.; Guannel, G.; Mumby, P.J.; Thomas, H.; Whitmee, S.; Woodley, S.; Fox, H.E.","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being used globally to conserve marine resources. However, whether many MPAs are being effectively and equitably managed, and how MPA management influences substantive outcomes remain unknown. We developed a global database of management and fish population data (433 and 218 MPAs, respectively) to assess: MPA management processes; the effects of MPAs on fish populations; and relationships between management processes and ecological effects. Here we report that many MPAs failed to meet thresholds for effective and equitable management processes, with widespread shortfalls in staff and financial resources. Although 71% of MPAs positively influenced fish populations, these conservation impacts were highly variable. Staff and budget capacity were the strongest predictors of conservation impact: MPAs with adequate staff capacity had ecological effects 2.9 times greater than MPAs with inadequate capacity. Thus, continued global expansion of MPAs without adequate investment in human and financial capacity is likely to lead to sub-optimal conservation outcomes. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Conservation issues: Oceanic ecosystems,"Neeman, N.; Servis, J.A.; Naro-Maciel, E.","Marine biodiversity is valued for its direct utility for people, the ecosystem services it provides, and its intrinsic worth. Marine ecosystems are subject to a variety of anthropogenic threats including disease, pollution, climate change, habitat alteration, overexploitation, and invasive species. Natural threats, such as physical destruction by storms and temperature and salinity changes from natural cycles, also occur. A suite of conservation approaches are used to protect these ecosystems and involve monitoring, management, and international cooperation.

Human considerations in the use of marine protected areas for biodiversity conservation,"Voyer, M.; Gladstone, W.","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are one approach, amongst many, for the protection of marine biodiversity. Although proven to be effective at protecting biodiversity and to be supported by local and wider communities, the implementation of some MPAs has been very contentious especially with fishing stakeholders. We researched the causes of these issues by examining the experience of implementation of the Batemans Marine Park in New South Wales, Australia. While MPA selection and management need to be based on rigorous science, a commensurate level of attention needs to be applied to understanding the social systems that also play a role in determining the protection measures and approaches. The most pressing issue that needs to be resolved early on in a planning process is the MPA's objectives, and whether these objectives are well understood and accepted by the local community. Building community support for MPAs also involves taking into account the different systems of knowledge and views of the natural world that exist within the community. Science alone is not sufficient to convince communities of the need for MPAs or their value in achieving conservation outcomes. Incorporating 'bottom-up' approaches into communication and engagement strategies will allow for a greater diversity of voices to be heard and acknowledged, protecting the planning processes against polarisation. Engaging local communities needs to go beyond large-scale consultation processes to include more rigorous, integrated social, economic and ecological assessment exercises, involving a collaborative participatory approach. Context is important and planning processes need to recognise the individual and unique needs of each affected community. Rigid ideas around the best means of achieving biodiversity protection combined with 'a one size fits all' approach to planning and community engagement are likely to exacerbate conflict and division and stimulate opposition. © 2018 Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales.",2017,,Australian Zoologist,39,2,173-180,,10.7882/AZ.2015.029,,#20789,Voyer 2017,,
British Columbia shoreline mapping : A comparison between different mapping systems and uses towards facilitating effective Pre-SCAT mapping and shoreline segmentation for oil spill response,"Reimer, D.; Laforest, S.; Lambert, P.","Carrying out an effective oil spill response requires the implementation of a shoreline mapping framework that can be used to establish practical management areas for operations, initiate tactics, evaluate and document oiling conditions and determine treatment priorities for selected coastline segments. Typical mapping frameworks designed for oil spills in marine environments characteristically divide coastlines into homogeneous segments that are relatively unique and have distinct physical features and sediment types that can be easily identified by responders. Although some information, such as oiling conditions, must be collected in real time, a large amount of directly relevant shoreline information can be assembled pre-spill including effective segmentation. Datasets of knowledge critical to aid in response decision making can be prepared in advance in the form and quality that would be needed in the event of a spill. In Canada, there is a long history of shoreline studies and mapping projects that have been undertaken to provide this level of information in preparation for shoreline impacts during an oil spill. Shoreline segmentation and mapping was first introduced in British Columbia (BC) in 1979. In the early 80's several parts of the BC coastline were studied and an evolution toward BC shore-zone mapping was starting to be developed. Over the years, multiple shoreline mapping projects have been undertaken by the BC Ministry of Environment, Environment Canada, Parks Canada, and private sectors providing a wealth of information covering the entire BC coastline. Environment and Climate Change Canada with the participation of experts continues to improve the sciences and tools to support shoreline operations during an oil spill. In 2013, Environment and Climate Change Canada reestablished a shoreline program to update the shoreline mapping and segmentation along parts of the BC coastline for oil spill response Pre-SCAT support. This paper will describe the history of shoreline mapping in BC and how data sets incorporated in different mapping approaches can be used to establish an oil spill response data framework for both Pre-SCAT and SCAT response applications.",2017,,,,,19-Jan,,,,#20792,Reimer 2017,,
Ongoing removals of invasive lionfish in Honduras and their effect on native Caribbean prey fishes,"Peiffer, F.; Bejarano, S.; de Witte, G.P.; Wild, C.","The invasion of Indo-Pacific lionfish is one of the most pressing concerns in the context of coral reef conservation throughout the Caribbean. Invasive lionfish threaten Caribbean fish communities by feeding on a wide range of native prey species, some of which have high ecological and economic value. In Roatan (Honduras) a local non-governmental organisation (i.e. Roatan Marine Park) trains residents and tourists in the use of spears to remove invasive lionfish. Here, we assess the effectiveness of local removal efforts in reducing lionfish populations. We ask whether reefs subject to relatively frequent removals support more diverse and abundant native fish assemblages compared to sites were no removals take place. Lionfish biomass, as well as density and diversity of native prey species were quantified on reefs subject to regular and no removal efforts. Reefs subject to regular lionfish removals (two to three removals month-1) with a mean catch per unit effort of 2.76 ± 1.72 lionfish fisher-1 h-1 had 95% lower lionfish biomass compared to nonremoval sites. Sites subject to lionfish removals supported 30% higher densities of native prey-sized fishes compared to sites subject to no removal efforts.We found no evidence that species richness and diversity of native fish communities differ between removal and non-removal sites. We conclude that opportunistic voluntary removals are an effective management intervention to reduce lionfish populations locally and might alleviate negative impacts of lionfish predation. We recommend that local management and the diving industry cooperate to cost-effectively extend the spatial scale at which removal regimes are currently sustained. © 2017 Peiffer et al.",2017,,PeerJ,2017,10,,,10.7717/peerj.3818,,#20794,Peiffer 2017,,
Bi-level programming model for shared parking considering residential parking resources,"Duan, M.; Yang, Z.; Mi, X.; Cheng, Z.","In order to relieve the parking problem caused by limited parking resources, a shared parking guidance and service process with the participation of residential parking spaces was proposed, which was based on the sharing parking theory and intelligent traffic guidance strategy. First, the basic conditions of sharing parking with residential areas were discussed. Then, a bi-level programming model of sharing parking guidance was established. In the model, the goal of the upper-level programming is to minimize the mean value of unoccupied parking difference index (MUPDI), which is the index to measure whether the parking resources are available for balanced use; while the goal of the lower-level is to minimize the average walking distance after parking, which is the basis to evaluate the feasibility of a shared parking. Finally, based on the solving principle of the bi-level programming model and the particle swarm optimization algorithm, a nested optimization algorithm was proposed to solve the programming model, and a simulation-based case study was made to verify their validity. The simulation shows that although the minimum real value of the parking unoccupied rate is 0.301 in the Hexiangyuan residential area, the maximum ratio of the residential parking lots that need to be shared for balanced use in peak time is only 0.093. This means that using the sharing scheme, the parking problem of the Ocean City can be relieved by using only 1/3 the unoccupied parking lots in the residential area. In addition, the average walking distance of 160.59 m shows the feasibility of the sharing scheme. © 2016, Editorial Department of Journal of Southwest Jiaotong University.

We performed qualitative and quantitative textual analysis of 240 documents and found that agreed international and national policies on genetic biodiversity are not reflected in management plans for Baltic Sea MPAs.

Stakeholder perceptions of a coastal marine protected area,"Clarke, B.; Thurstan, R.; Yates, K.","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are an increasingly utilised marine and coastal management tool, with rates of designation rising steeply over the last twenty years. MPAs are most commonly designated for biological conservation objectives and the management is thus focused primarily on meeting conservation goals, with associated monitoring programs gathering data on a narrow suite of biological indicators. However, MPAs also have a wide range of potential social and economic impacts and the ability to meet the goals of an MPA is highly influenced by the often unmonitored perceptions and buy-in of local stakeholders. Here we examine a range of stakeholder perceptions concerning a coastal MPA in South Australia. We conducted semi-structured interviews with individuals engaged in the MPA's planning and designation process, as well as those involved with its ongoing management. We explored their understanding of the purpose of the MPA, whether they thought the MPA was successful and the future management challenges the MPA might face. In particular, we focused on eliciting from stakeholders indicators they thought should be used to monitor the ongoing performance of the MPA. Perceptions varied between stakeholder groups, however, the majority of respondents highlighted the importance of socioeconomic factors in the ongoing performance of the MPA. The vast majority of them suggested both biological and socio-economic indicators that should be incorporated into monitoring programs. Our findings highlight the need for MPA planning and management, when defining goals and developing monitoring programs, to be mindful to incorporate social and economic, as well as, biological indicators. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2016.",2016,,,1,75,622-626,,10.2112/SI75-125.1,,#20820,Clarke 2016,,
Intakes of fish and polyunsaturated fatty acids and mild-to-severe cognitive impairment risks: A dose-response meta-analysis of 21 cohort studies,"Zhang, Y.; Chen, J.; Qiu, J.; Li, Y.; Wang, J.; Jiao, J.","Background: The intake of fish and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may benefit cognitive function. However, optimal intake recommendations for protection are unknown. Objective: We systematically investigated associations between fish and PUFA intake and mild-to-severe cognitive impairment risk. Design: Studies that reported risk estimates for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cognitive decline, dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), or Parkinson disease (PD) from fish, total PUFAs, total n-3 (v-3) PUFAs, or at least one n-3 PUFA were included. Study characteristics and outcomes were extracted. The pooled RR was estimated with the use of a random-effects model metaanalysis. A dose-response analysis was conducted with the use of the 2-stage generalized least-squares trend program. Results: We included 21 studies (181,580 participants) with 4438 cases identified during follow-up periods (2.1-21 y). A 1-serving/wk increment of dietary fish was associated with lower risks of dementia (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.99; P = 0.042, I2 = 63.4%) and AD (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.95; P = 0.003, I2 = 74.8%). Pooled RRs of MCI and PD were 0.71 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.82; P = 0.733, I2 = 0%) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.99; P = 0.221, I2 = 33.7%), respectively, for an 8-g/d increment of PUFA intake. As an important source of marine n-3 PUFAs, a 0.1-g/d increment of dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intake was associated with lower risks of dementia (RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.96; P &lt; 0.001, I2 = 92.7%) and AD (RR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.76; P &lt; 0.001, I2 = 94.5%). Significant curvilinear relations between fish consumption and risk of AD and between total PUFAs and risk of MCI (both P-nonlinearity &lt; 0.001) were observed. Conclusions: Fishery products are recommended as dietary sources and are associated with lower risk of cognitive impairment. Marinederived DHA was associated with lower risk of dementia and AD but without a linear dose-response relation. © 2016 American Society for Nutrition.",2016,,American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,103,2,330-340,,10.3945/ajcn.115.124081,,#20822,Zhang 2016,,

Systematic conservation planning within a Fijian customary governance context,"Wendt, H.K.; Weeks, R.; Comley, J.; Aalbersberg, W.","Although conservation planning research has influenced conservation actions globally in the last two decades, successful implementation of systematic conservation plans in regions where customary marine tenure exists has been minimal. In such regions, local community knowledge and understanding of socioeconomic realities may offer the best spatially explicit information for analysis, since required socioeconomic data are not available at scales relevant to conservation planning. Here we describe the process undertaken by the Kadavu Yaubula Management Support Team, a team of researchers from The University of the South Pacific and the local communities to assess whether systematic conservation planning tools can be effectively applied and useful in a customary governance context, using a case study from Fiji. Through a participatory approach and with the aim of meeting local-scale conservation and fisheries needs, a spatial conservation planning tool, Marxan with Zones, was used to reconfigure a collection of locally designed marine protected areas in the province of Kadavu in order to achieve broader objectives. At the local scale, the real value of such tools has been in the process of identifying and conceptualising management issues, working with communities to collate data through participatory techniques, and in engaging communities in management decision making. The output and use of the tool has been of secondary value. The outcome was invaluable for developing marine protected area network design approaches that combine traditional knowledge with ecological features in a manner appropriate to a Melanesian context. © CSIRO 2016.",2016,,Pacific Conservation Biology,22,2,173-181,,10.1071/PC16001,,#20834,Wendt 2016,,
"Building on Liquefiable and Compressible Soil for a Major Transit Project in Salem, Massachusetts","Fuselier, T.H.; Morrison, J.K.; Zafir, Z.","The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is addressing accessibility throughout their facilities. Improvements at the Commuter Rail Station in Salem, Massachusetts include a five-level parking garage, a pedestrian bridge, two accessible elevators, and a full-length accessible high-level platform, as well as a passenger drop-off/pick-up area, secure bicycle parking, and improved traffic flow patterns for buses and taxis. The project site is bound by North River to the north, and is retained by a 12 feet high seawall along the river. Subsurface conditions generally consist of fill overlying loose, potentially liquefiable saturated sands, overlying very soft to soft marine clay deposits extending to till and rock at about 60 to 80 feet depth. The site was classified as a seismic Site Class F, which called for a site-specific site response analysis and structurally robust parking garage building. Deep foundations in the form of drilled shafts bearing on rock were recommended for structural support of the garage. Through cooperation of the structural and geotechnical teams and evaluations of many options, ground improvement in the form of vibratory stone columns (VSCs) was recommended to address the liquefaction and lateral spreading potential, and improve the seismic site classification to Site Class E. The project team evaluated value-engineering options. The final design consisted of the installation of controlled modulus columns (CMCs) below the garage and bridge footings, and VSCs below the parking garage and platform. The project involved developing detailed specifications for ground improvement and a verification program to assess the effectiveness of the VSCs. The unique site conditions required additional coordination between the geotechnical and structural design teams, as well as the construction team during the design phase of the project. The collaboration between the teams was integral in allowing the project to move forward, ultimately saving the client millions in construction costs.",2016,,,,,1450-1459,,10.1061/9780784479742.121,,#20835,Fuselier 2016,,

"The seascape of demersal fish nursery areas in the North Mediterranean Sea, a first step towards the implementation of spatial planning for trawl fisheries","Colloca, F.; Garofalo, G.; Bitetto, I.; Facchini, M.T.; Grati, F.; Martiradonna, A.; Mastrantonio, G.; Nikolioudakis, N.; Ordinas, F.; Scarcella, G.; Tserpes, G.; Tugores, M.P.; Valavanis, V.; Carlucci, R.; Fiorentino, F.; Follesa, M.C.; Iglesias, M.; Knittweis, L.; Lefkaditou, E.; Lembo, G.; Manfredi, C.; Massutí, E.; Pace, M.L.; Papadopoulou, N.; Sartor, P.; Smith, C.J.; Spedicato, M.T.","The identification of nursery grounds and other essential fish habitats of exploited stocks is a key requirement for the development of spatial conservation planning aimed at reducing the adverse impact of fishing on the exploited populations and ecosystems. The reduction in juvenile mortality is particularly relevant in the Mediterranean and is considered as one of the main prerequisites for the future sustainability of trawl fisheries. The distribution of nursery areas of 11 important commercial species of demersal fish and shellfish was analysed in the European Union Mediterranean waters using time series of bottom trawl survey data with the aim of identifying the most persistent recruitment areas. A high interspecific spatial overlap between nursery areas was mainly found along the shelf break of many different sectors of the Northern Mediterranean indicating a high potential for the implementation of conservation measures. Overlap of the nursery grounds with existing spatial fisheries management measures and trawl fisheries restricted areas was also investigated. Spatial analyses revealed considerable variation depending on species and associated habitat/depth preferences with increased protection seen in coastal nurseries and minimal protection seen for deeper nurseries (e.g. Parapenaeus longirostris 6%). This is partly attributed to existing environmental policy instruments (e.g. Habitats Directive and Mediterranean Regulation EC 1967/2006) aiming at minimising impacts on coastal priority habitats such as seagrass, coralligenous and maerl beds. The new knowledge on the distribution and persistence of demersal nurseries provided in this study can support the application of spatial conservation measures, such as the designation of no-take Marine Protected Areas in EU Mediterranean waters and their inclusion in a conservation network. The establishment of no-take zones will be consistent with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy applying the ecosystem approach to fisheries management and with the requirements of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive to maintain or achieve seafloor integrity and good environmental status. © 2015 Colloca et al.",2015,,PLoS ONE,10,3,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0119590,,#20859,Colloca 2015,,

A Species Distribution Modelling method was used for each PMH to map the potential distribution of ""most suitable"" habitat. The area and percentage cover was calculated within each country's Exclusive Economic Zone for the baseline (2009) and the projected (2100) years. In addition, a conservation management score was calculated based on the number of PMHs that co-occur in assessment units. Overall, this study reveals the potential for movement and/or change in the extent of some PMHs across the NE Atlantic under an increased ocean temperature scenario (4 °C) by 2100. There are regional differences in the predicted changes and some countries will experience greater/different changes than others. The movement of biodiversity hotspots (where one or more PMHs occur in the same broad area) provides both opportunities and risks for conservation management that are discussed. Co-operation between neighbouring countries and marine regions will require substantial enhancement in order to provide a robust adaptive management strategy going forward. © 2014 The Authors.",2015,,Marine Policy,53,,54-66,,10.1016/j.marpol.2014.11.017,,#20861,Gormley 2015,,

GTL FPSO & modular GTL as potential solutions for developing offshore oil & gas fields,"Kwon, H.; Choi, D.; Moon, Y.; Ahn, S.; Jang, N.; Lim, H.; Kim, W.; Denholm, D.; Park, T.","Growing global energy demands have led us to development of new oil & gas fields. In the meantime interest in eco-friendly solutions has been increasing in the area of stranded & associated gas fields. According to the BP report 2015, global natural gas reserves are approximately 6,607 tcf. Nearly half of that is assumed to be stranded & associated gas that is uneconomical for market delivery due to its remoteness from potential markets and lack of economic transportation, infrastructure and GTL conversion technology. Therefore, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) has researched Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) & Modular GTL as potential solutions for developing offshore oil & gas fields. Because products of the GTL process can be easily combined with crude oil in the Hull tanks and used in the existing energy infrastructure. From a shipbuider s perspective, key design considerations in assessing onshore GTL technology for GTL FPSO & Modular GTL application were studied and analyzed as follows: Robustness to marine motion, Limited space, Weight and height, Self-sufficiency, Safety, Constructability and Certification Requirement. Moreover, commercial & demonstrated GTL technologies involved in Gas Treatment, Pre-Reformer, Reformer, Fischer-Tropsch Reactor, Upgrading and others were compared and reviewed to determine which technology is the best option for GTL FPSO & Modular GTL. Additionally, we have studied which GTL application method would be more competitive depending on the gas production size in offshore fields. Moreover, preliminary market analysis was performed to better define the scope of GTL products to be produced. Economic analysis was also performed to identify the major cost factors and understand their sensitivity on the project. DSME has recently completed the feasibility study to acquire the preliminary design & engineering of GTL FPSO & Modular GTL for stranded gas & associated gas fields in offshore locations. The results of this feasibility study suggest that design concepts of GTL applications are technically practicable. The clean fuel and the chemical feedstock from the GTL process will be profitable in the markets and the design concept will be economically competitive within the range of the current project cost factors. DSME hopes to set up a cooperative network with competitive companies for the next stage of GTL FPSO & Modular GTL. The cooperation network will implement at GTL FPSO & Modular GTL Pre-FEED and the economic study and will result in the commercial realization of this innovative approach for monetizing stranded & associated gas fields offshore.

A large-scale common birds monitoring scheme for French overseas departments: Adaptations of the STOC-EPS protocol to tropical environments ,"Claessens, O.; Conde, B.; Laurent, N.","A long-term monitoring program for common birds was initiated in 2012 in French Guiana, and on the islands of Martinique and Reunion, three French overseas departments. It is based on the model of the French Breeding Bird Survey (STOC-EPS), the protocol of which has been only slightly modified to adapt to regional constraints and to the biology of species of these tropical regions. STOC-EPS consists of standardized point counts with unlimited distance, performed each year at the same locations and at the same date within the breeding season by the same observer (JULLIARD &amp; JIGUET, 2002). 5 minutes duration, which is the standard for all European monitoring programs (EBCC 2014), was selected for our three overseas departments. In French Guiana, two counting periods were retained in order to complain with asynchronous breeding seasons between species: 1st March - 15 April, and 1st November - 15 December. The time slot used is from 06:30 to 09:00. In Martinique two sessions are performed during the single breeding season, between 1st April and 20 June, with a gap of 4 to 6 weeks between the two sessions. The counting begins once daylight permits, and finishes no later than 09:30. In Reunion, a single annual session is planned, from 1st October to 15 November. The period of counting is between 30 minutes after sunrise and 3.5 hours after sunrise. In metropolitan France, a STOC station consists of 10 permanent points arranged within a 2 × 2 km randomly chosen plot (JULLIARD &amp; JIGUET, 2002). This strategy is inapplicable in our territories where many places are inaccessible, where observers are unevenly distributed or whose mosaic of habitats requires a more targeted approach. Different sampling methods have been adopted in each of the three overseas departments. All of them are based on 10-points routes assigned to each observer. In Reunion, 620 count points were defined to cover the entire island and have been pre-positioned on a map, according to the principle of stratified sampling: number of points per habitat proportional to the total area occupied by this habitat. In Martinique, we prioritized protected sites or sites classified as ZNIEFF (important nature areas), but the final choice is left to the observers, who most often choose sites close to their home. Classified sites, nature reserves or other protected sites are covered by partner organizations. The diversity of habitats in Martinique is properly reflected by the 42 currently existing routes. In French Guiana, the observer can choose his route. The number of routes is not limited and is intended to increase with time and by recruitment of new observers. Their distribution is heterogeneous, according to the distribution of observers and to access difficulties of parts of the country; however they are representative of the habitat diversity. The minimum distance between points varies from a minimum 200m in dense forest habitats to 300m or more in open habitats. In the course of designing the STOC-EPS protocol in our three departments, a supporting and validation mission was performed by the Muséum National d'Histoire naturelle (MNHN), which is the inventor and the coordinator of the French Breeding Bird Survey (JULLIARD &amp; JIGUET, 2002). This validation by a scientific body whose expertise in this field is unquestionable and internationally recognized, is a strong aspect of the process, which guarantees scientific legitimacy to the results that will eventually be produced by the STOC-EPS in our regions. To compensate for the lack of skilled ornithologists in the DOMs and to cover remote areas, it was necessary to resort to partner organizations acting in the field of conservation (43% to 65% of the observers). Whether from partner or volunteer structures, on average 75% of the observers initially had little or no experience with bird watching. They had to be trained and accompanied in the early years. In addition, each participant was given educational materials such as a sound bank, audio-CDs, training software or recording tools. The first STOC-EPS campaigns have been set up and the first surveys were conducted in French Guiana, Martinique and Reunion at the end of 2012. In French Guiana, the network expands regularly, 40 routes are operational in 2015 and 11 others are defined but have not yet been operated. In Reunion, 61 routes (of the 62 defined) were performed in 2013. In Martinique, the network included 43 routes in 2014 and 10 more in 2015, operated by 34 observers, which demonstrates the interest in the program and the involvement of its participants. The few examples of analyses from the raw data of STOC-EPS in Reunion (Fig. 1, 2 and 3) show that this type of survey can provide interesting results from the first years on, regardless of the time factor. Following Reunion, Martinique and French Guiana, a few other territories have recently begun to deploy breeding bird surveys, based on the STOCEPS model. In the Indian Ocean, Mauritius and Rodrigues both engaged in the STOC-EPS program in 2014; STOC-EPS also started in Mayotte in 2007, however it is there performed until now by a unique observer, which makes the long-term survival of the program precarious. In Lesser Antilles, Guadeloupe, another French overseas department, engaged in the program in 2014 (association AMAZONA, http://www.amazona-guadeloupe.com/actionsen-cours.htm\). And in the Pacific Ocean, New Caledonia, a special French overseas territory, deployed a similar long-term survey of terrestrial birds (STOT: ""Suivi Temporel des Oiseaux Terrestres"") since 2010 (BABY, 2014; SANCHEZ, 2014). It is hoped that other islands of the Caribbean and other Neotropical countries will implement similar long-term and country-wide programs for large scale monitoring of bird populations.",2015,,Alauda,83,4,273-284,,,,#20865,Claessens 2015,,

This paper reports the development and evaluation of a culturally appropriate screening tool called the Here and Now Aboriginal Assessment (HANAA). The initial phase included development of a glossary of Aboriginal terms and concepts relating to SEWB. The glossary was used to identify 10 key HANAA domains, which included physical health, sleep, mood, suicide risk and self harm, substance use, memory, unusual experiences, functioning, life stressors and resilience. Evaluation of the HANAA included exploration of its cultural applicability, feasibility, reliability and validity. The HANAA was well accepted by study participants and easily implemented by assessors. Reliability was good, with inter-rater agreements between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal assessors measured by Kappa statistics ranging from 0.5 to 1.0. There was also a good agreement between assessors and treating clinicians in identifying the main presenting problem and recommended course of action. The HANAA is a culturally appropriate and useful tool for the screening of SEWB among Aboriginal adults.

Assessing assessments of NAFTA’s marine environment: The commission for environmental cooperation meets the world ocean assessment,"Baker, B.","INTRODUCTION Imagine, for a moment, the marine area of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a blue blanket enveloping the North American continent. It cloaks the Canadian Archipelago and fills the Beaufort Sea; it wraps the coasts and continental shelves off of Nunavut, the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, the Northwest Territories, and the state of Alaska. Abutting Russian waters, it cups the Chukchi Sea and funnels through the Bering Strait. It connects the Aleutian and Pribilof islands in the ring of fire, and surrounds Hawaii. It laps the continent’s western coast from British Columbia to Chiapas via Washington, Oregon, California, Baja California, Oaxaca, and other states. It warms the Gulf of Mexico from the Yucatan to Florida, channels the Gulf Stream from the mid-Atlantic seaboard, sweeps along the Maritime Provinces, fills the Hudson Bay and contains the icy waters of the Davis Strait. Combined, the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of Canada, Mexico, and the United States cover over fifteen million square kilometers of ocean, almost two and a half times the size of Australia’s EEZ. The NAFTA marine areas, which are not necessarily conterminous with the three EEZs, also contain some of the highest net primary productivity rates in the world. The creation of the EEZ as a new maritime zone by the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea heralded a new era for coastal states in relation to marine resources. As coastal states were required to take account of other states’ interests in this new zone, multilateralism eventually became the operative rule for managing substantial portions of ocean space. The entry into force of NAFTA twelve years later, in 1994, and the simultaneous creation of the Commission for North American Environmental Cooperation (CEC) added a regional component to how Canada, Mexico, and the United States regarded their neighboring marine areas. The CEC, established by Part III of the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC), is responsible for annual reports, including regular assessments of the region’s environment. These annual CEC reports have not been systematic in their treatment of NAFTA’s ocean areas, but individual CEC initiatives on the marine environment have produced such useful tools as the 2009 book Marine Ecoregions of North America, The North American Environmental Atlas, and ecological “scorecards” for marine protected areas (MPA). © Cambridge University Press 2015.",2015,,"NAFTA and Sustainable Development: History, Experience, and Prospects for Reform",,,191-203,,10.1017/CBO9781316157763.009,,#20867,Baker 2015,,
A perspective on the management of coral reef fisheries,"Friedlander, A.M.","Fisheries on coral reefs provide food, employment, recreation, and cultural identity for hundreds of millions of people around the world. The complex nature of these fisheries means that the vast majority are either unmanaged or undermanaged, and most go un assessed. Fisheries management relies on controlling fishing effort (e.g. seasonal and area closures, gear restrictions, limited entry) and/or catch (e.g. bag and size limits, catch quotas) and many of these measures have been practiced in various forms for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. Standard techniques and assumptions in use today have been developed primarily for large-scale industrial fisheries targeting relatively few species, leaving most coral reef fisheries with little or no scientific advice to guide management decisions. The lack of even the most basic knowledge on catch and effort in all but a few of these fisheries makes harvest controls impractical except for a small number of select and valuable single species fisheries. Spatial management, in the form of MPAs, customary marine tenure, and more comprehensive marine zoning, along with restrictions on destructive and overly efficient fishing gear holds the greatest promise for reversing the decline in coral reef fisheries and the associated ecosystem. There is an urgent need to reform coral reef management and focus on the resilience of coral reefs as linked social–ecological systems. Coral reef fisheries are extremely complex, with hundreds of species targeted by myriad gear types with numerous landing sites and distribution channels [1808]. The multispecies, multi-gear nature of these fisheries presents a number of management challenges, particularly in developing countries where most of these fisheries occur [1621]. In addition, the high biodiversity value of coral reefs means that the goals of sustainable fisheries are often at odds with maintaining ecosystem function and viability [198]. Fisheries on coral reefs run the gamut from fully commercial to purely subsistence, with many fishers participating in multiple sectors of these fisheries, often at the same time [609,1179,2007]. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",2015,,Ecology of Fishes on Coral Reefs,,,208-214,,10.1017/CBO9781316105412.023,,#20868,Friedlander 2015,,
Family Model of Diabetes Education With a Pacific Islander Community,"McElfish, P.A.; Bridges, M.D.; Hudson, J.S.; Purvis, R.S.; Bursac, Z.; Kohler, P.O.; Goulden, P.A.","Purpose The purpose of the study was to use a community-based participatory research approach to pilot-test a family model of diabetes education conducted in participants’ homes with extended family members. The pilot test included 6 families (27 participants) who took part in a family model of diabetes self-management education (DSME) using an intervention-driven pre- and posttest design with the aim of improving glycemic control as measured by A1C. Questionnaires and additional biometric data were also collected. Researchers systematically documented elements of feasibility using participant observations and research field reports. More than three-fourths (78%) of participants were retained in the study. Posttest results indicated a 5% reduction in A1C across all participants and a 7% reduction among those with type 2 diabetes. Feasibility of an in-home model with extended family members was documented, along with observations and recommendations for further DSME adaptations related to blood glucose monitoring, physical activity, nutrition, and medication adherence. The information gained from this pilot helps to bridge the gap between knowledge of an evidence-based intervention and its actual implementation within a unique minority population with especially high rates of type 2 diabetes and significant health disparities. Building on the emerging literature of family models of DSME, this study shows that the family model delivered in the home had high acceptance and that the intervention was more accessible for this hard-to-reach population. © 2015, SAGE Publications.

First, both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted to examine the reliability and validity of scale and to descriptive statistics. Second, multi group analysis was conducted to examine if there was a significant difference in the established path model between sexes. Third, both correlation and multiple regression analysis were conducted to examine the inter relation among measurement items of the established path. Forth, path analysis was conducted to examine the path of established study model. The results were as follows. First, the structure of each measurement item was confirmed. Second, there was significant difference in established path model between sexes. There were significant differences in participation motivation and intention to re-participate between sexes, higher in men, but no significant difference in perceived risk. Third, there is a significant positive or negative correlation among each measurement item. Forth, perceived risk has a direct influence on participation motivation (direct effect=-.33), and participation motivation has a direct influence on re-participation intentions (direct effect= .56). As a result, this research shows that the lower the perceived risk, the higher the participation motivation and the re-participation intention in marine sports. © 2014 Coastal Education and Research Foundation.",2014,,,30,Special Issue 72,96-100,,10.2112/SI72-018.1,,#20872,Park 2014,,
Obtaining a social licence for MPAs - influences on social acceptability,"Voyer, M.; Gladstone, W.; Goodall, H.","The biological success of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) depends to a large extent on their social acceptability, sometimes referred to as a social licence. Local resistance has slowed international progress towards a global network of MPAs. The causes of local resistance and limited social acceptability are poorly known, which constrains the development of new planning paradigms that could address these issues. Two case studies in New South Wales, Australia determined the factors that influenced community attitudes towards MPAs. The Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park (PSGLMP) and Batemans Marine Park (BMP) underwent virtually identical and concurrent planning processes, however resistance to the BMP was more intense and sustained. Differences in the demographics, history, local media coverage and social impacts of each marine park contributed to these different community responses. The BMP demonstrated the 'perfect storm' of opposition triggers - a community struggling in the transition away from a primary production economy, a highly politicised media dominated by powerful elites with ideological objections to the park, and social impacts sufficiently profound to motivate local citizens to support an active campaign against the park. These impacts included loss of access, identity and increased competition for resources. This research points to the importance of developing a deeper understanding of the social, cultural and political landscape of the communities in which MPAs are proposed and a rethink of planning processes to better incorporate community objectives and knowledge. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,,Marine Policy,51,,260-266,,10.1016/j.marpol.2014.09.004,,#20874,Voyer 2014,,
A U-shaped association between consumption of marine n-3 fatty acids and development of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter - A Danish cohort study,"Rix, T.A.; Joensen, A.M.; Riahi, S.; Lundbye-Christensen, S.; Tjønneland, A.; Schmidt, E.B.; Overvad, K.","Aims Previous studies have suggested a lower risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) with higher intakes of fish and marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), but the results have been inconsistent. The aim was to investigate the association between consumption of marine n-3 PUFA and development of AF.Methods and results A total of 57 053 Danish participants 50-64 years of age were enrolled in the Diet, Cancer, and Health Cohort Study between 1993 and 1997. Dietary intake of fish and marine n-3 PUFA was assessed by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. In total, 3345 incident cases of AF occurred over 13.6 years. Multivariate Cox regression analyses (3284 cases and 55 246 participants) using cubic splines showed a U-shaped association between consumption of marine n-3 PUFA and risk of incident AF, with the lowest risk of AF at a moderate intake of 0.63 g/day. For quintiles of marine n-3 PUFA intake, a 13% statistically significant lower risk of AF was seen in the middle vs. lowest quintile: Q1 reference, Q2 HR 0.92 (95% CI 0.82-1.03), Q3 HR 0.87 (95% CI 0.78-0.98), Q4 HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.86-1.08), and Q5 HR 1.05 (95% CI 0.93-1.18). Intake of total fish, fatty fish, and the individual n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid also showed U-shaped associations with incident AF.Conclusion We found a U-shaped association between consumption of marine n-3 PUFA and risk of incident AF, with the lowest risk close to the median intake of total marine n-3 PUFA (0.63 g/day). © 2014 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Getting it right for the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis): A last opportunity for effective marine spatial planning?,"Petruny, L.M.; Wright, A.J.; Smith, C.E.","The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) faces increasing pressure from commercial shipping traffic and proposed marine renewable energy developments. Drawing upon the successful Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary model, we propose a multi-stakeholder marine spatial planning process that considers both appropriate positioning of offshore wind farms and redefining commercial shipping lanes relative to whale migration routes: placement of wind turbines within certain right whale habitats may prove beneficial for the species. To that end, it may be advisable to initially relocate the shipping lanes for the benefit of the whales prior to selecting wind energy areas. The optimal end-state is the commercial viability of renewable energy, as well as a safe shipping infrastructure, with minimal risk of collision and exposure to shipping noise for the whales. This opportunity to manage impacts on right whales could serve as a model for other problematic interactions between marine life and commercial activities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,,Marine Pollution Bulletin,85,1,24-32,,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.06.004,,#20881,Petruny 2014,,

In order to stop further losses and maintain important ecosystem services, programmes have been put into place to reduce and ideally halt these processes. A whole suite of different approaches is needed to meet these goals. One major scientific contribution is to collate, integrate and analyse the large amounts of fragmented and diverse biodiversity data to determine the current status and trends of biodiversity in order to inform the relevant decision makers. To contribute towards the achievement of these challenging tasks, the project EU BON was developed. The project is focusing mainly on the European continent but contributes at the same time to a much wider global initiative, the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), which itself is a part of the Group of Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). EU BON will build on existing infrastructures such as GBIF, LifeWatch and national biodiversity data centres in Europe and will integrate relevant biodiversity data from on-ground observations to remote sensing information, covering terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. A key feature of EU BON will be the delivery of relevant, fully integrated data to multiple and different stakeholders and end users ranging from local to global levels. Through development and application of new standards and protocols, EU BON will enable greater interoperability of different data layers and systems, provide access to improved analytical tools and services, and will provide better harmonised biodiversity recording and monitoring schemes from citizen science efforts to long-term research programs to mainstream future data collecting. Furthermore EU BON will support biodiversity sciencepolicy interfaces, facilitate political decisions for sound environmental management, and help to conserve biodiversity for human well-being at different levels, ranging from communal park management to the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Additionally, the project will strengthen European capacities and infrastructures for environmental information management and sustainable development. The following paper outlines the framework and the approach that are pursued.

Toward the new role of marine and coastal protected areas in the arctic: The Russian case,"Spiridonov, V.; Gavrilo, M.; Krasnov, Y.; Makarov, A.; Nikolaeva, N.; Sergienko, L.; Popov, A.; Krasnova, E.","The role of marine and coastal protected areas (MCPAs) is becoming increasingly important in the changing Arctic. These protected areas potentially facilitate the adaptation of natural ecosystems to climate change by mitigating direct anthropogenic threats, balance various kinds of space and resources use, and alert the society to changes taking place in the marine and coastal ecosystems. This chapter explores how a historically established set of coastal and marine protected areas in the Russian Arctic can meet these challenges. Eight strictly protected nature reserves or zapovedniks, one national park, three federal natural reserves or zakazniks, and one nature monument encompass marine compartments or have marine buffer zones. They cover a number of essential biodiversity features: some marine areas within MCPAs may be considered as integral marine ecosystems or include sites of primary importance for ecosystem monitoring because of the existence of long-term observation datasets. The total marine surface area under protection totals nearly 96,000 km2, or about 2% of the areas of the Arctic seas under Russia's jurisdiction (the Bering Sea excluded). Management of the Arctic MCPAs is a very complex task. It is no surprise that management effectiveness of the federal Arctic MCPAs in Russia is scored relatively low. Potential threats and future challenges to the protection of Arctic marine biodiversity and MCPAs are discussed in this chapter, essentially calling for strengthening the MCPA network. As it is difficult to expect that the number of MPAs in the Russian influence zone can be significantly increased in the next decade, the efforts of conservation organizations should be balanced between advocating for creating new reserves and strengthening the capacity of the existing MCPAs. General remoteness and limited access to most of the Arctic MCPAs call for development of remote sensing and other distant methods for monitoring and surveillance. The challenges for the MCPA network in the Arctic are difficult to meet when using only the inherent zapovednik and national park capacity and governmental support to date. To be effective, establishing a horizontal cooperation and partnership with science, NGOs, businesses, and local communities is the only way for protected natural areas to perform their important mission in a changing Arctic. © 2012 Springer.

"Evaluating Māori community initiatives to promote Healthy Eating, Healthy Action","Hamerton, H.; Mercer, C.; Riini, D.; McPherson, B.; Morrison, L.","Māori, the indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand, experience poorer health than non-Māori across a range of health measures. Interventions focused at an individual level have proved largely ineffective; 'bottom-up' approaches where communities determine their own priorities may be more sustainable than 'top-down' approaches where goals are determined by health authorities. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate an innovative health promotion programme aimed at improving Māori health and to discuss the importance of ownership and control of health initiatives by Māori. Evaluators conducted a comprehensive evaluation of a Healthy Eating Healthy Action programme in six small Māori health agencies, gathering information from programme managers and co-ordinators, participants and wider community members about what changes were occurring at individual, family and community levels. Effective interventions built on cultural values and practices and were delivered by Māori with close connections to the community. Changes in nutrition and physical activity made by participants also benefitted their wider families and community. The changes demonstrated subtle but important shifts in thinking about healthy eating and healthy activity that in the longer term could lead to more measurable change towards improved quality of life for people within communities. © 2012 © The Author (2012).

"The arctic and world ocean: Current state, prospects and challenges of hydrocarbon resources development","Bogoyavlensky, V.","The report provides information on the current state and prospects of oil and gas resources development in the major offshore oil and gas basins of the World, including the Arctic. Considered the most important achievements and negative results of offshore oil and gas industry in the last decade. Illustrates the main trends of the offshore oil and gas production volume in the Arctic and the World Ocean in comparison with trends of the unconventional hydrocarbons production. It is shown that Russia is the leader in terms of hydrocarbons production, both the Arctic onshore and offshore. Provides information on the geological and geophysical study density of the Arctic waters and the current state of the geophysical and drilling fleets of Russia. The analyses of the petrophysical and thermobaric conditions studies at big depths are presented. Shows a great role of abnormally high reservoir pressures (AHRP) to maintain industrial reservoirs, which significantly increases the hydrocarbon resources of the Arctic region. It is proved that Russia is the leader in the Arctic hydrocarbon reserves and resources. Advices on selecting priority projects for the development on the Arctic offshore are given. Particular attention is paid to natural and man-made problems of the offshore oil and gas resources development, including AHRP, permafrost, gas pockets and gas hydrates. It is shown that the waters of five countries in the Arctic region is not enough studied to start a large-scale oil and gas fields development.

"Integrated vulnerability assessment on small island regions towards integrated coastal zone management (ICZM): A case study of Thousand Islands, Indonesia","Farhan, A.R.; Lim, S.","Centralized development, population growth and pollution are contributing factors to ocean and coastal management problems in Indonesia, particularly in the small island regions. Indonesia, consisting of more than 17,504 small islands, has beat adopting and implementing the Integrated Coastal Zone Management program in order to achieve sustainable development. However, many disputes between local communities and governments are observed since Kepulauan Seribu, also known as Thousand Islands, became a Marine National Park in the early 1980s. For a century, the islands located in the northern part of Indonesia’s Capital have experienced severe anthropogenic pressures from the surrounding environment, which caused a loss of some islands and the degradation of regional ecosystems. This study aims to assess the social, economic and environmental impacts on Thousand Islands as influenced by anthropogenic factors, using vulnerability indices and Geographic Information Systems. The assessment is based on a qualitative analysis and a survey of decision-makers, aiming to evaluate the policy that has been involved within ocean and g coastal management in the region. From the data analysis results, it can be summarized that the region has the sustainability in a social and economic perspective; however, it is the environment that is severely deteriorated It is found that the policies to maintain the balance of social, economic and environmental J impacts have failed in order to overcome the changes. In addition, the ambiguity and powerlessness of law enforcement has caused damage to the environment to some extent. Therefore, coordination between the central government and local governments, as well as public participation is recommended, in order to monitor, evaluate and (if possible) redevelop the region. © Geoinformatics International.",2014,,International Journal of Geoinformatics,10,4,16-Jan,,,,#20894,Farhan 2014,,
Flexible 'on country' training for indigenous seafarers,"Hurd, S.; Findlater, R.; Weaving, J.","This paper presents the concept, challenges and results of Certificate II Coxswain and Certificate II Marine Engine Driver (MED3) training that was tailored for a specific cohort of indigenous candidates within a unique set of training parameters. The challenge presented to the Vocational Education and Training (VET) area of the Australian Maritime College (AMC) was to integrate with an existing maritime training program in the Torres Strait region of Far North Queensland and then take the program forward with student pathways into higher level vocational maritime qualifications. With relatively short notice, assessments were completely redesigned to minimise written components and to maximise workplace demonstrations of competence, learning material was re-written to be language-neutral, and presentations and diagrams were converted to functioning physical training aids. The training commenced with a pilot course in November 2013. It was shown that the benefits of this training were that the students remained 'on country' (that is, in their traditional geographic region) and that on board the training vessel they were not just trained and assessed; they lived the lives of Coxswains and Marine Engine Drivers for a full four weeks. The feedback from students on completion of the course was overwhelmingly positive, and there was very high course completion rate. The governing partner agencies, AMSA and the TSRA, were entirely satisfied with the innovative and tailored training that delivered nationally recognised qualification outcomes to each of the participants. The innovative approach to maritime training and the successful results to date have caught the interest of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and a similar approach will be used to tailor maritime training for that authority's indigenous marine rangers in remote communities on Cape York. AMC's flexibility and innovation has also set the precedent for this style of delivery across all remote indigenous areas of northern Australia. © 2014 Australian Maritime College, an institute of the University of Tasmania.",2014,,,,,279-284,,,,#20896,Hurd 2014,,

Created in 2008, it was the first Marine Protected Area (MPA) of its kind (at the time of inception, the largest in the world) and includes eight low-lying islands, shallow coral reefs, submerged shallow and deep seamounts and extensive open-ocean and ocean floor habitat. Due to their isolation, the shallow reef habitats have been protected de facto from severe exploitation, though the surrounding waters have been continually fished for large pelagics and whales over many decades. PIPA was created under a partnership between the Government of Kiribati and the international non-governmental organizations-Conservation International and the New England Aquarium. PIPA has a unique conservation strategy as the first marine MPA to use a conservation contract mechanism with a corresponding Conservation Trust established to be both a sustainable financing mechanism and a check-and-balance to the oversight and maintenance of the MPA. As PIPA moves forward with its management objectives, it is well positioned to be a global model for large MPA design and implementation in similar contexts. The islands and shallow reefs have already shown benefits from protection, though the pending full closure of PIPA (and assessments thereof) will be critical for determining success of the MPA as a refuge for open-ocean pelagic and deep-sea marine life. As global ocean resources are continually being extracted to support a growing global population, PIPA's closure is both timely and of global significance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,,Advances in Marine Biology,69,,289-324,,10.1016/B978-0-12-800214-8.00008-6,,#20898,Rotjan 2014,,
A seachange in environmental capability development,"Walls, A.; Walker, S.; O'Brien, R.; Yoder, J.","Offshore exploration and production continues to be a major focus for the oil and gas industry, with the deepwater accounting for over 50% of all conventional new reserves discovered worldwide between 2007 and 2012. Like most oil and gas companies, BP has a dedicated and committed team of environmental advisors. However, a need to strengthen capability in marine science was identified. No courses were available commercially that offered suitable marine science training to develop the skills required, and to keep advisors up-to-date with new advances in scientific understanding and techniques. In 2011, BP worked with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), MA to develop a two week course in marine science that would provide an in-depth understanding of the fundamental physical, chemical and biological aspects of marine science, and application of those fundamentals in an industry context. The syllabus developed also provides an insight into the practical aspects of marine science through tours of the WHOI laboratories and facilities and an offshore planning, sampling and data collection exercise. The course was run in 2011 and 2012, with a total of 37 delegates from 13 countries attending. The benefits to participants have been high, with some even moving to new roles based on their acquired expertise, and the company now has a large resource base of capable marine scientists who are better equipped to manage marine projects and operations. WHOI has also benefited as the course gives staff and students direct exposure to industry representatives, enabling them to better understand the industry context. Each year, feedback was sought and incorporated into the syllabus in order to continuously improve the learning offer for participants. This experience has demonstrated how, through partnership with world-class academic institutions, it is possible to develop high-quality environmental training offers that develop much needed capability for the industry. This paper will examine how the WHOI course has been made a success, what the benefits of this type of training are (to individuals and to companies), and what options are available for maintaining and further developing marine science capability going forward.

Why the complex nature of integrated ecosystem assessments requires a flexible and adaptive approach,"Dickey-Collas, M.","This article considers the approach taken by the ICES to integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs) in the context of the wider evolution of IEAs and the science/policy landscape within the ICES region. It looks forward and considers the challenges facing the development of IEAs, specifically those of scoping for objectives, participatory engagement, developing indicators and targets, risk analysis, and creating tools to evaluate management measures for marine anthropogenic activities. It concludes that expectations that the implementation of IEAs will take an ordered, stepwise approach will lead to disappointment and frustration. This is a consequence of the need to operate in an adaptive manner in a complex system. The ecosystem, the science support infrastructure, and the governance systems are all complex. Plus when engaged in a debate about societal objectives, we expect to encounter a complex and changing landscape. As a community, the challenge is to find leverage mechanisms to encourage IEA efforts to provide insights and tools within resources. We will need to innovate and be responsive to the complexity of the ecosystem and governance structures encountered when performing IEA. © 2014 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Assessment of plasma C-Reactive protein as a biomarker of posttraumatic stress disorder risk,"Eraly, S.A.; Nievergelt, C.M.; Maihofer, A.X.; Barkauskas, D.A.; Biswas, N.; Agorastos, A.; O'Connor, D.T.; Baker, D.G.","IMPORTANCE Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated in cross-sectional studies with peripheral inflammation. It is not known whether this observed association is the result of PTSD predisposing to inflammation (as sometimes postulated) or to inflammation predisposing to PTSD. OBJECTIVE To determine whether plasma concentration of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) helps predict PTSD symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Marine Resiliency Study, a prospective study of approximately 2600 war zone-deployed Marines, evaluated PTSD symptoms and various physiological and psychological parameters before deployment and at approximately 3 and 6 months following a 7-month deployment. Participants were recruited from 4 all-male infantry battalions imminently deploying to a war zone. Participation was requested of 2978 individuals; 2610 people (87.6%) consented and 2555 (85.8%) were included in the present analysis. Postdeployment data on combat-related trauma were included for 2208 participants (86.4%of the 2555 included) and on PTSD symptoms at 3 and 6 months after deployment for 1861 (72.8%) and 1617 (63.3%) participants, respectively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Severity of PTSD symptoms 3 months after deployment assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). RESULTS We determined the effects of baseline plasma CRP concentration on postdeployment CAPS using zero-inflated negative binomial regression (ZINBR), a procedure designed for distributions, such as CAPS in this study, that have an excess of zeroes in addition to being positively skewed. Adjusting for the baseline CAPS score, trauma exposure, and other relevant covariates, we found baseline plasma CRP concentration to be a highly significant overall predictor of postdeployment CAPS scores (P = .002): each 10-fold increment in CRP concentration was associated with an odds ratio of nonzero outcome (presence vs absence of any PTSD symptoms) of 1.51 (95%CI, 1.15-1.97; P = .003) and a fold increase in outcome with a nonzero value (extent of symptoms when present) of 1.06 (95% CI, 0.99-1.14; P = .09). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A marker of peripheral inflammation, plasma CRP may be prospectively associated with PTSD symptom emergence, suggesting that inflammation may predispose to PTSD. © 2014 American Medical Association.

Association between traumatic brain injury and risk of posttraumatic stress disorder in active-duty marines,"Yurgil, K.A.; Barkauskas, D.A.; Vasterling, J.J.; Nievergelt, C.M.; Larson, G.E.; Schork, N.J.; Litz, B.T.; Nash, W.P.; Baker, D.G.","Importance Whether traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been difficult to determine because of the prevalence of comorbid conditions, overlapping symptoms, and cross-sectional samples. OBJECTIVE To examine the extent to which self-reported predeployment and deployment-related TBI confers increased risk of PTSD when accounting for combat intensity and predeployment mental health symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS As part of the prospective, longitudinal Marine Resiliency Study (June 2008 to May 2012), structured clinical interviews and self-report assessments were administered approximately 1 month before a 7-month deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan and again 3 to 6 months after deployment. The study was conducted at training areas on a Marine Corps base in southern California or at Veterans Affairs San Diego Medical Center. Participants for the final analytic sample were 1648 active-duty Marine and Navy servicemen who completed predeployment and postdeployment assessments. Reasons for exclusions were nondeployment (n = 34), missing data (n = 181), and rank of noncommissioned and commissioned officers (n = 66). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas the total score on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) 3 months after deployment. RESULTS At the predeployment assessment, 56.8%of the participants reported prior TBI; at postdeployment assessment, 19.8%reported sustaining TBI between predeployment and postdeployment assessments (ie, deployment-related TBI). Approximately 87.2%of deployment-related TBIs were mild; 250 of 287 participants (87.1%) who reported posttraumatic amnesia reported less than 24 hours of posttraumatic amnesia (37 reported -24 hours), and 111 of 117 of those who lost consciousness (94.9%) reported less than 30 minutes of unconsciousness. Predeployment CAPS score and combat intensity score raised predicted 3-month postdeployment CAPS scores by factors of 1.02 (P < .001; 95%CI, 1.02-1.02) and 1.02 (P < .001; 95%CI, 1.01-1.02) per unit increase, respectively. Deployment-related mild TBI raised predicted CAPS scores by a factor of 1.23 (P < .001; 95% CI, 1.11-1.36), and moderate/severe TBI raised predicted scores by a factor of 1.71 (P < .001; 95%CI, 1.37-2.12). Probability of PTSD was highest for participants with severe predeployment symptoms, high combat intensity, and deployment-related TBI. Traumatic brain injury doubled or nearly doubled the PTSD rates for participants with less severe predeployment PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Even when accounting for predeployment symptoms, prior TBI, and combat intensity, TBI during the most recent deployment is the strongest predictor of postdeployment PTSD symptoms.

An overview of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP),"Kravitz, B.; Robock, A.; Forster, P.M.; Haywood, J.M.; Lawrence, M.G.; Schmidt, H.","The Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) was designed to determine robust climate system model responses to solar geoengineering. GeoMIP currently consists of four standardized simulations involving reduction of insolation or increased amounts of stratospheric sulfate aerosols. Three more experiments involving marine cloud brightening are planned. This project has improved confidence in the expected climate effects of geoengineering in several key areas, such as the effects of geoengineering on spatial patterns of temperature and the spatial distribution of precipitation, especially extreme precipitation events. However, GeoMIP has also highlighted several important research gaps, such as the effects on terrestrial net primary productivity and the importance of the CO2 physiological effect in determining the hydrologic cycle response to geoengineering. Future efforts will endeavor to address these gaps, as well as encourage cooperation with the chemistry modeling communities, the impact assessment communities, and other groups interested in model output.

Extension of coastal state jurisdiction in enclosed and semi-enclosed seas: A Mediterranean and Adriatic perspective,"Grbec, M.","The current jurisdictional status of the Mediterranean Sea is remarkable. Nearly 50 per cent of the Mediterranean waters are high seas and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of coastal States. This situation means that there are no points in the Mediterranean Sea where the coasts of two States would be more than 400 nautical miles apart. Such a legal situation generally prevents coastal States from adopting and enforcing their laws on the Mediterranean high seas, in respect of many important fields such as the protection and preservation of the marine environment, as well as the conservation of marine living resources. The jurisdictional landscape of the Adriatic Sea as a sub-sea and sub-region of the Mediterranean, is even more interesting. Croatia has proclaimed an Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone, Slovenia has proclaimed a Zone of Ecological Protection, while Italy has adopted a framework law for the proclamation of its Zone of Ecological Protection without proclaiming its regime in the Adriatic. It is noteworthy that if all Mediterranean and Adriatic States would proclaim an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), there would not be a single stretch of high seas left in the entire Mediterranean Sea. Both the Adriatic and Mediterranean fall in the category of enclosed or semi-enclosed seas regulated by Part IX of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This book assesses the legal nature of Part IX of UNCLOS and discusses potential benefits of the extension of coastal State jurisdiction (proclamation of EEZs and/or similar sui generis zones), particularly in light of the recent calls towards an integrated and holistic approach to the management of different activities in the Mediterranean Sea. It examines the actual or potential extension of coastal State jurisdiction in the Adriatic Sea, against the background of similar extensions elsewhere in the Mediterranean and against the background of relevant EU policies. It additionally explores whether Part IX of UNCLOS imposes any duties of cooperation in relation to the extension of coastal State jurisdiction in enclosed or semi-enclosed seas, and puts forward practical suggestions as to how the issue of extension of coastal State jurisdiction could be approached in a way which would enhance States existing cooperation and improve the overall governance in the Mediterranean and Adriatic seas. This book will be of interest to policymakers and academics and students of international law, and the law of the sea. © 2014 Mitja Grbec.

"The vulnerability of communities around the marine protected areas of bamboung, cayar and joal-fadiouth in senegal: Places of adaptation to climate change","Drame, A.; Sambou, P.B.","Climate change accelerates the vulnerability of resources that are of great importance to the lives of communities in many parts of the world. This study aims to analyze the vulnerability and adaptation to climate change of local populations in and around marine protected areas (MPAs) in Senegal. The methodology is based on Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and the CRISTAL tool used to assess the vulnerability of communities and adaptation strategies. The Climate Information Portal (CIP) has been used to make projections of rainfall and temperature; allowing projections to be ‘downscaled’ to local areas. The results show that the riparian communities of three MPAs (Bamboung, Joal-Fadiouth and Cayar) are facing climate and non-climate vulnerabilities. Strategies for current and potential adaptation options have been identified to overcome the various hazards and these are outlined. Strategies are designed to contribute to the sustainable improvement of the living conditions of communities around the MPAs. © 2013, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

Collaboration among countries in marine conservation can achieve substantial efficiencies,"Mazor, T.; Possingham, H.P.; Kark, S.","Aim: Multinational collaboration is important for successfully protecting marine environments. However, few studies have assessed the costs and benefits incurred by taking collaborative action. One of the most complex marine regions in the world is the Mediterranean Sea biodiversity hotspot. The sea is shared by over 20 countries across three continents with a vast array of socio-economic and political backgrounds. We aimed to examine how collaboration between countries of the Mediterranean Sea affects conservation plans when costs and threats are considered. Location: The Mediterranean Sea. Methods: We compared three collaboration scenarios to test the efficiencies of coordinated marine conservation efforts: full coordination between Mediterranean countries, partial coordination within continents and no coordination where countries act in isolation. To do so, we developed four basin-wide surrogates for commercial and recreational fishing effort in the Mediterranean Sea. Using a systematic decision support tool (Marxan), we minimized the opportunity costs while meeting a suite of biodiversity targets. Results: We discovered that to reach the same conservation targets, a plan where all the countries of the Mediterranean Sea collaborate can save over two-thirds of the cost of a plan where each country acts independently. The benefits of multinational collaboration are surprisingly unequal between countries. Main conclusions: This approach, which incorporates biodiversity, costs and collaboration into a systematic conservation plan, can help deliver efficient conservation outcomes when planning spatially explicit actions within marine environments shared by many countries. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2013,,Diversity and Distributions,19,11,1380-1393,,10.1111/ddi.12095,,#20919,Mazor 2013,,
Can Competent Authorities Cooperate for the Common Good: Towards a Collective Arrangement in the North-East Atlantic,"Johnson, D.","The OSPAR Commission implements the regional seas convention for the North-East Atlantic and has been at the forefront of delivering the ecosystem approach through the development of robust measures to deal with marine pollution. For purposes of assessment the OSPAR Maritime Area is divided into five Regions, Region I representing 'Arctic Waters.' OSPAR Region I includes the transition between the Boreal and true Arctic biogeographic zones, incorporates the presence of the North Atlantic Current as well as the northward flowing Norwegian Coastal Current, and is characterised by seasonally high primary productivity and high natural variability. The starting point for a 'collaborative arrangement' between relevant competent authorities, with the aim of ensuring a highest level of conservation of selected areas in the North-East Atlantic beyond national jurisdiction, was explored at an informal Workshop in Madeira in March 2010. The Ministerial Meeting of OSPAR, held in Bergen in September 2010, agreed unprecedented protection of six extensive marine protected areas (MPAs) in Region V, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and isolated seamounts. Whilst being required to protect biodiversity, OSPAR does not have competence for those activities that are arguably the most likely to have the most impact in these remote areas, namely fisheries, international shipping and seabed mining. Most multilateral environmental agreements have adopted key principles that enshrine sustainable development and governance ideals. Regimes of this sort, designed to limit pressures and impacts of human activities, have elements in common with built in checks and balances designed to govern exploitation. By focussing on a defined geographic area and recognising the value of its natural capital, it has proven possible to scope complementary and mutually reinforcing management measures. OSPAR, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) [18] and the International Seabed Authority (ISA) have started to consider this in respect of one MPA - the Charlie Gibbs Fracture Zone. The intention is to broaden the discussion to include other competent authorities. A combined regime of this nature demands transparency and trust between competent authorities. It becomes incumbent on States in agreement within one competent authority to influence and work within other competent authorities. It also requires that States reach a common position internally between those dealing with different sectors within their administrations. Given that such a solution is unprecedented, there is merit in establishing a pilot case to focus the best scientific and legal minds. Ultimately, however, such a solution becomes a matter of political will and decision.",2013,,NATO Science for Peace and Security Series C: Environmental Security,135,,333-343,,10.1007/978-94-007-4713-5_29,,#20922,Johnson 2013,,
Marine lipid fraction PCSO-524™ (lyprinol®/omega XL®) of the New Zealand green lipped mussel attenuates hyperpnea-induced bronchoconstriction in asthma,"Mickleborough, T.D.; Vaughn, C.L.; Shei, R.-J.; Davis, E.M.; Wilhite, D.P.","Purpose Evaluate the effect of the marine lipid fraction of the New Zealand green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus) PCSO-524™ (Lyprinol ®/Omega XL®), rich in omega-3 fatty acids, on airway inflammation and the bronchoconstrictor response to eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea (EVH) in asthmatics. Methods Twenty asthmatic subjects, with documented HIB, participated in a placebo controlled double-blind randomized crossover trial. Subjects entered the study on their usual diet and were then placed on 3 weeks of PCSO-524™ or placebo supplementation, followed by a 2 week washout period, before crossing over to the alternative diet. Pre- and post-eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea (EVH) pulmonary function, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), asthma symptom scores, medication use, exhaled breath condensate (EBC) pH, cysteinyl leukotrienes (cyst-LT), 8-isoprostane and urinary 9α, 11β-prostaglandin (PG)F2 and Clara (CC16) protein concentrations were assessed at the beginning of the trial and at the end of each treatment period. Results The PCSO-524™ diet significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) the maximum fall in post-EVH FEV1 (-8.4 ± 3.2%) compared to usual (-19.3 ± 5.4%) and placebo diet (-22.5 ± 13.7%). Pre- and post- EVH EBC cyst-LT and 8-isoprostane, and urinary 9α, 11β-PGF2 and CC16 concentrations were significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) on the PCSO-524™ diet compared to the usual and placebo diet. EBC pH and asthma symptom scores were significantly improved (p &lt; 0.05) and rescue medication use significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) on the PCSO-524™ diet compared to the usual and placebo diet.

"Fisheries biology, assessment and management: Second edition","King, M.","This excellent second edition of Fisheries Biology, Assessment and Management, has been fully updated and expanded, providing a book which is an essential purchase for students and scientists studying, working or researching in fisheries and aquatic sciences. In the same way that excessive hunting on land has threatened terrestrial species, excessive fishing in the sea has reduced stocks of marine species to dangerously low levels. In addition, the ecosystems that support coastal marine species are threatened by habitat destruction, development and pollution. Open access policies and subsidised fishing are placing seafood in danger of becoming a scarce and very expensive commodity for which there is an insatiable demand. Positive trends include actions being taken to decrease the incidental catches of non-target species, consumer preferences for seafood from sustainable fisheries, and the establishment of no-take areas that provide refuges for marine species. But there is an urgent need to do more. Because there is an increasing recognition of the need to manage ecosystems as well as fish stocks, this second edition of this bestselling text book includes an additional chapter on marine ecology. Chapters on parameter estimation and stock assessment now include step-by-step instructions on building computer spreadsheet models, including simulations with random variations that realistically emulate the vagaries of nature. Sections on ecosystem management, co-management, community-based management and marine protected areas have been expanded to match the increased interest in these areas. Containing many worked examples, computer programs and numerous high quality illustrations, Fisheries Biology, Assessment and Management, second edition, is a comprehensive and essential text for students worldwide studying fisheries, fish biology, aquatic and biological sciences. As well as serving as a core text for students, the book is a superb reference for fisheries and aquatic researchers, scientists and managers across the globe, in both temperate and tropical regions.

"Coral assemblages in Tonga: Spatial patterns, replenishment capacities, and implications for conservation strategies","Adjeroud, M.; Briand, M.J.; Kayal, M.; Dumas, P.","Coral reefs in Tonga have been confronted by multiple threats of various origins, including large-scale disturbances and human-induced stressors. These reef communities have been poorly studied, and efficient conservation actions are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to: (1) examine the spatial distribution of coral assemblages in the lagoon of Tongatapu; (2) determine the degree to which spatial heterogeneity of adult corals is influenced by recruitment processes; and (3) examine the implications of these results in terms of conservation actions. We recorded a total of 37 adult and 28 juvenile coral genera, a mean density of 11.6 adult and 5.5 juvenile colonies m -2, and a dominance of Montipora, Acropora, and Porites. For seven of the 10 dominant genera, spatial patterns of adults were linked to the short-term recruitment pattern history. Despite a reduced diversity and abundance of adult corals in some areas, the lagoon of Tongatapu retains the potential for replenishment through recruitment of young corals. Consequently, we suggest that conservation actions should focus on reducing factors causing coral mortality and maintain suitable conditions for the establishment and growth of juvenile corals, thus increasing the probability that they will reach maturity and participate to the maintenance of local populations. Rather than establishing a large marine protected area, which will almost certainly suffer from a lack of control and poor enforcement, alternative conservation measures could be successfully implemented through the establishment of several small village-based marine reserves, as has been undertaken in other South Pacific islands with promising results. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",2013,,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,185,7,5763-5773,,10.1007/s10661-012-2982-5,,#20930,Adjeroud 2013,,
Improving the seasonal forecast for summertime South China rainfall using statistical downscaling,"Tung, Y.L.; Tam, C.-Y.; Sohn, S.-J.; Chu, J.-L.","The performance of various seasonal forecast systems in predicting the station-scale summer rainfall in South China (SC) was assessed and was compared with that based on a statistical downscaling scheme. Hindcast experiments from 11 dynamical models covering the period of 1983-2003 were taken from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Climate Center multimodel ensemble. Based on observations, singular value decomposition analysis (SVDA) showed that SC precipitation is strongly related to the broad-scale sea level pressure (SLP) variation over Southeast Asia, western north Pacific, and part of the Indian Ocean. Analogous covariability was also found between model hindcasts and the observed station precipitation. Based on these results from SVDA, a statistical downscaling scheme for predicting SC station rainfall with model SLP as predictor was constructed. In general, the statistical scheme is superior to the original model prediction in two geographical regions, namely, western SC (near Guangxi) and eastern coastal SC (eastern Guangdong to part of Fujian). Further analysis indicated that dynamical models are able to reproduce the large-scale circulation patterns associated with the recurrent modes of SC rainfall, but not the local circulation features. This probably leads to erroneous rainfall predictions in some locations. On the other hand, the statistical scheme was able to map the broad-scale SLP patterns onto the station-scale rainfall anomalies, thereby correcting some of the model biases. Overall, our results demonstrate how SC summer rainfall predictions can be improved by tapping the source of predictability related to large-scale circulation signals from dynamical models. © 2013.

A coupled model of the global cycles of carbonyl sulfide and CO 2: A possible new window on the carbon cycle,"Berry, J.; Wolf, A.; Campbell, J.E.; Baker, I.; Blake, N.; Blake, D.; Denning, A.S.; Kawa, S.R.; Montzka, S.A.; Seibt, U.; Stimler, K.; Yakir, D.; Zhu, Z.","Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is an atmospheric trace gas that participates in some key reactions of the carbon cycle and thus holds great promise for studies of carbon cycle processes. Global monitoring networks and atmospheric sampling programs provide concurrent data on COS and CO2 concentrations in the free troposphere and atmospheric boundary layer over vegetated areas. Here we present a modeling framework for interpreting these data and illustrate what COS measurements might tell us about carbon cycle processes. We implemented mechanistic and empirical descriptions of leaf and soil COS uptake into a global carbon cycle model (SiB 3) to obtain new estimates of the COS land flux. We then introduced these revised boundary conditions to an atmospheric transport model (Parameterized Chemical Transport Model) to simulate the variations in the concentration of COS and CO2 in the global atmosphere. To balance the threefold increase in the global vegetation sink relative to the previous baseline estimate, we propose a new ocean COS source. Using a simple inversion approach, we optimized the latitudinal distribution of this ocean source and found that it is concentrated in the tropics. The new model is capable of reproducing the seasonal variation in atmospheric concentration at most background atmospheric sites. The model also reproduces the observed large vertical gradients in COS between the boundary layer and free troposphere. Using a simulation experiment, we demonstrate that comparing drawdown of CO 2 with COS could provide additional constraints on differential responses of photosynthesis and respiration to environmental forcing. The separation of these two distinct processes is essential to understand the carbon cycle components for improved prediction of future responses of the terrestrial biosphere to changing environmental conditions.

"A unique marine and environmental science program for high school teachers in Hawai'i: Professional development, teacher confidence, and lessons learned","Rivera, M.A.J.; Manning, M.M.; Krupp, D.A.","Hawai'i is a unique and special place to conduct environmental science inquiry through place based learning and scientific investigation. Here, we describe and evaluate a unique professional development program for science teachers in Hawai'i that integrates the traditional approach of providing training to improve content knowledge, with the overarching theme of scientific inquiry and investigation through short duration research experiences. Ten middle and high school teachers primarily from Hawai'i public high schools participated in the four week, full time professional development course, producing novel place-based lesson plans to execute in their home classrooms. Pre and post analyses of teacher reported confidence levels in teaching ten environmental and marine science topics showed significant improvements after the course. In addition, teachers continued professional relationships with scientists and instructors of the program through synergistic activities including partnering in grant proposal submissions, participating in related university offered programs for K-12 audiences, and facilitating student research internships with university scientists. Despite the overwhelming positive evaluations by teachers of the value and efficacy of the program, lack of funding and access to equipment were reported as anticipated limitations to implementing their newly gained knowledge in the classroom. Nonetheless, the program's success demonstrates that both teachers and scientists can benefit from a course of this nature, and using this framework, other organizations might adapt elements of the course to provide a similar place-based program in their respective back yards. © 2006-2013 by ESER, Eurasian Society of Educational Research.

Helping ocean scientists represent and communicate Science,"deCharon, A.; Duguay, L.; McDonnell, J.; Peach, C.; Companion, C.; Herren, C.; Harcourt, P.; Repa, T.; Ferraro, C.; Kwon, P.; Lichtenwalner, S.; Simms, E.; Whitley, L.","Public appreciation and basic understanding of the role the ocean plays in the global environment has become more important as the urgency to make decisions on complex environmental issues has increased. Because communicating science to the public is often challenging for scientists, they can benefit from employing methods such as concept mapping, which ""deconstructs"" science into discrete ideas and organizes them into graphical formats. Responding to recommendations by ocean science faculty who participated in concept-mapping workshops with pre-college educators, four Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence designed, implemented, and evaluated a series of professional development workshops for graduate students. These workshops engaged 20 faculty-level ocean scientists to help 73 graduate students depict complex scientific ideas using concept maps. Evidence shows that operationally breaking down topics and reorganizing them into graphical formats benefited faculty and graduate students alike. Each workshop culminated with the graduate students delivering oral presentations to nonscientist audiences such as high school students. Graduate students were highly rated on their abilities to place topics within a broad societal context. In a follow-up survey, graduate students recognized the potential of concept mapping to enhance their professional skills and to organize their own research. © 2013 by The Oceanography Society.

Anthropometry: A new approach to identify communal body fat status in an urban south Indian population,"Mohan, K.B.K.; Sapthagirivasan, V.; Anburajan, M.","Background and objectives: Deep penetration of obesity into geographical and ethnic communities based on profession is being highly evidenced by researchers. Impact of this penetration in the Indian urban population is addressed by the accepted factors of professional and cultural changes. High risk of Atherosclerosis, hyperinsulinaemia, impaired glucose tolerance; prothrombotic is not addressed by the relationship between BMI vs. body fat, while body fat plays major role in all risks. The present study attempts to prove an anthropometrical empirical formula which can be an indicator of body fat in a group, based on profession or life style. Methods: A total number of 159 (77 males of age 36.95 ± 14.795, 82 females of age 38.07 ± 13.16) subjects participated in the study. Body composition analysis and anthropometric measurements were performed after conducting careful clinical examination. Body fat was measured using body composition analyzer and used as a reference to justify indication of anthropometrical empirical indicator (AEI). Indicative accuracy of AEI was cross verified by male and female analysis individually. Results: Community specific mean body fat 23.15 ± 8.47 (kg) for the mean weight of 66.05 ± 13.46 (kg) indicated prevalence of excess 35% body fat. This much of body fat has not been addressed by mean BMI 25.56 ± 4.66 (kg/m2). Conclusions and interpretation: Statistical relation between AEI and body fat reflects original information of risk (where as BMI does not) in the selected community. AEI outperforms the identification of obesity affected profession or life style based communities over BMI analysis. © 2011 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.

Marine communities based congestion control in underwater wireless sensor networks,"Domingo, M.C.","Congestion control in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) is an important but challenging issue. TCP performs very poorly in UWSNs due to its inability to distinguish between packet losses due to congestion and those due to channel error. The existing congestion control protocols developed for terrestrial sensor networks cannot be applied to UWSNs because the characteristics of the underwater channel such as high bit error rates, high attenuation and propagation delays, multipath and Doppler distortion have not been considered. In this paper, a biologically-inspired congestion control protocol has been proposed for UWSNs based on the ability of marine communities to terminate with phytoplankton blooms and move the system back to equilibrium between species. The proposed distributed algorithm distinguishes between packet losses due to congestion and those due to high link error rates. It eliminates flow starvation and provides flow fairness. The channel effects of underwater propagation on packet losses are captured, the shadow zones are detected and the throughput of the flows from different nodes at the receiver is restored even with channel fading. Consequently, the system goes back to a stable state, where the different event flows coexist. The theoretical analysis and numerical evaluations show the performance of the proposed congestion control protocol in UWSNs. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Assessment of Southern Ocean mixed-layer depths in CMIP5 models: Historical bias and forcing response,"Sallée, J.-B.; Shuckburgh, E.; Bruneau, N.; Meijers, A.J.S.; Bracegirdle, T.J.; Wang, Z.","The development of the deep Southern Ocean winter mixed layer in the climate models participating in the fifth Coupled Models Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) is assessed. The deep winter convection regions are key to the ventilation of the ocean interior, and changes in their properties have been related to climate change in numerous studies. Their simulation in climate models is consistently too shallow, too light and shifted equatorward compared to observations. The shallow bias is mostly associated with an excess annual-mean freshwater input at the sea surface that over-stratifies the surface layer and prevents deep convection from developing in winter. In contrast, modeled future changes are mostly associated with a reduced heat loss in winter that leads to even shallower winter mixed layers. The mixed layers shallow most strongly in the Pacific basin under future scenarios, and this is associated with a reduction of the ventilated water volume in the interior. We find a strong state dependency for the future change of mixed-layer depth, with larger future shallowing being simulated by models with larger historical mixed-layer depths. Given that most models are biased shallow, we expect that most CMIP5 climate models might underestimate the future winter mixed-layer shallowing, with important implications for the sequestration of heat, and gases such as carbon dioxide, and therefore for climate. © 2013.

The Endangered Species Act: A primer,"Corn, M.L.; Alexander, K.; Buck, E.H.","The Endangered Species Act (ESA, P.L. 93-205, 87 Stat. 884. 16 U.S.C. §§1531-1544) has a stated purpose of conserving species identified as endangered or threatened with extinction, and conserving ecosystems on which they depend. It is perennially controversial because the protections provided can make it the visible policy focal point for underlying situations involving the allocation of scarce or diminishing lands or resources, especially in instances where societal values may be changing. In response to past controversies, Congress has repeatedly considered minor amendments and major changes to the act. No action has been taken to date in the 112th Congress, but the issue is likely to resurface in the 113th Congress. The purpose of the chapter is to describe the major features and controversies of the ESA as background for consideration of possible amendments in the 113th Congress. The major features of ESA and related controversies are briefly summarized as follows: ESA retains its authorities even though its authorization for funding expired in 1992, and funds may be and have been appropriated in the absence of a current authorization. ESA prohibitions and penalties remain in effect regardless of appropriations. ESA's principal parts are the listing and protection of species, designation of critical habitat and avoidance of its destruction, and consultation by federal agencies regarding actions that may harm listed species. Each of these three principal parts is discussed in detail. Dwindling species are listed as either endangered or threatened according to assessments of the risk of their extinction. Once a species is listed, legal tools are available to aid its recovery and to protect its habitat.ESA has broad provisions for citizen suits to enforce the act, and lawsuits have played a major role in enforcement and interpretation of many, or perhaps most, of the act's provisions. ESA provides for exemptions from the act for agency projects, but the provisions are little used for a variety of reasons. The act is administered primarily by the Fish and Wildlife Service, and by the National Marine Fisheries Service for certain marine and anadromous species. ESA is the implementing legislation for U.S. participation in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. ESA often becomes controversial even where a particular species is not the focus of a controversy but a symptom of it. The Endangered Species Act (ESA)1 frequently receives significant congressional attention. It offers comprehensive protection for species identified as endangered or threatened with extinction. Over the years, the power of this protection has ignited calls for greater bounds on this power, as well as assertions of its lax implementation. The following discussion provides an overview and background on the various features of the ESA that contribute to its legal stature and yet spark an ongoing debate over its implementation2 &amp; © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

There are also little data comparing HF cohorts of differing ethnicity within the Asia-Pacific region. Methods: The Singapore Heart Failure Outcomes and Phenotypes (SHOP) study and Prospective Evaluation of Outcome in Patients with Heart Failure with Preserved Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (PEOPLE) study are parallel prospective studies using identical protocols to enroll patients with HF across 6 centers in Singapore and 4 in New Zealand. The objectives are to determine the relative prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of patients with HF and preserved EF (EF ≥50%) compared with those with HF and reduced EF, and to determine initial data on ethnic differences within and between New Zealand and Singapore. Case subjects (n = 2,500) are patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of HF or attending outpatient clinics for management of HF within 6 months of HF decompensation. Control subjects are age- and gender-matched community-based adults without HF from Singapore (n = 1,250) and New Zealand (n = 1,073). All participants undergo detailed clinical assessment, echocardiography, and blood biomarker measurements at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6 months, and are followed over 2 years for death or hospitalization. Substudies include vascular assessment, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, retinal imaging, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusions: The SHOP and PEOPLE studies are the first prospective multicenter studies defining the epidemiology and interethnic differences among patients with HF in the Asia-Oceanic region, and will provide unique insights into the pathophysiology and outcomes for these patients. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Examining the Impacts of Development Patterns on Flooding on the Gulf of Mexico Coast,"Brody, S.; Kim, H.; Gunn, J.",This article addresses this understudied aspect of development patterns and community resiliency by examining a five-year record of insured flood loss claims across 144 counties and parishes fringing the Gulf of Mexico. Linear regression models are employed to isolate the effects of five different development patterns on observed flood losses from 2001 to 2005 while controlling for multiple contextual variables. A novel approach is taken to measuring development form by using a series of landscape metrics usually reserved for ecological analysis. These measures enable the assessment of the form of the regional built environment with more specificity than has been possible in previous studies. Results indicate that more connected and concentrated development patterns lead to a reduction in the amount of observed flood losses. These findings illustrate the importance of regional planning and design for fostering flood-resilient communities. © 2012 Urban Studies Journal Limited.,2013,,Urban Studies,50,4,789-806,,10.1177/0042098012448551,,#20953,Brody 2013,,
Northern Hemisphere blocking frequency and duration in the CMIP5 models,"Dunn-Sigouin, E.; Son, S.-W.","Northern Hemisphere (NH) blocking climatology is examined using a subset of climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). Both historical and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 integrations are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the CMIP5 models and to identify possible changes in NH blocking frequency and duration in a warmer climate. Comparison with reanalysis data reveals that CMIP5 models can reproduce the NH blocking climatology reasonably well, although the frequency of Euro-Atlantic blockings, particularly those with relatively short duration, is significantly underestimated during the cold season. In most models, overestimation of the Pacific blocking frequency is also evident for all durations throughout the year. In comparison to historical integrations, RCP 8.5 integrations show significant decreases in blocking frequency over both the North Pacific and north Atlantic regions, with a hint of increasing blocking frequency over western Russia. However, there is no noticeable change in the duration of individual blocking events for all durations.

MARGov - Setting the ground for the governance of marine protected areas,"Vasconcelos, L.; Ramos Pereira, M.J.; Caser, U.; Gonçalves, G.; Silva, F.; Sá, R.","Started in 2008, the MARGov project proposes to build a Model of Collaborative Governance for Marine Protected Areas (MPA), using as a case study the Marine Park Luiz Saldanha (MPLS), Sesimbra, Portugal. The project works through an eco-social dialogue supported by active participation and aims to empower the local communities making them active agents for the sustainable governance of the coast and the ocean. In fact, successful MPA depend on the balance between man and environment, and on the eco-social dialogue established among all actors. The MARGov project is structured in three components - Governance, Citizenship and Dynamic-Spatial Structure. Here we present the work already developed in two of the components - Governance and Citizenship. The first component mainly aims at reinforcing competences and the co-responsibility of all key-actors within MPLS. Several participatory sessions, involving the local community, have been organized since the end of 2009 improving the communication and to set up a constructive dialog - reducing sources of conflict - among all the stakeholders. The Citizenship component targeted to re-establish the traditional affective link between the local community and the ocean, mostly by means of environmental education sessions in elementary schools. In this paper we present the methodology, the main results and discuss the lessons learned, theorizing from action and exploring how to pursue in the future for the sustainable management of Portuguese MPA. Intermediate outcomes include specific actions (e.g., strategy to promote sustainable tourism, enhance co-liability of users in inspection and surveillance); as well as comprehensive ones, such as a proposal to expand the existing strategic council of the MPA towards a satellite structure of co-management that includes representatives of different stakeholder groups in continuing articulation. The methodology developed for the collaborative process as, so far, revealed to have a substantial potential in enhancing trust building and empowerment.

11th annual Space Generation Congress: Earth observation session report on space applications for water management,"Laygo, K.; Bernede, N.; Antoniou, N.; Akinwumi, O.","Water is one of the most fundamental resources, needed for drinking, agriculture, sanitation and industry. Due to its vitality, the issues and practices of water resource management continue to be a rising challenge for stakeholders and decision makers. Space-based Earth Observations (EO) is a valuable technology to efficiently monitor the Earth's resources. It is beneficial for assessing the water cycle on local, regional and global levels and in providing information (with peaceful objectives) for events that may span the borders of multiple countries. A great number of space-based technologies such as land and marine observation, along with weather satellites, are available and allow for the precise monitoring and measurement of water resources and factors that in influence the water cycle and inform water management. This paper focuses on EO applications for water management related to consumption, agriculture, and safety. Accessing clean water and monitoring water quality and resources are vital to the consumption component. Improving or enhancing agricultural productivity and benefiting from ecosystem services are vital to the second focus area of agriculture. Enhancing water-related disaster (e.g. floods and landslides) management and improving sanitation fall within the third focus area of safety. The study sought to make concrete connections between EO applications and secure, sustainable access to the basic living necessities such as food, water, and shelter. The analysis identifies the importance of utilizing EO for water management by assessing the current global situation and the perspectives of stakeholders, decision makers, international organizations, the public, and the commercial sectors. The importance of stakeholder awareness of space capabilities and of their cooperation in water management is underscored. Finally, the paper presents four main recommendations on ways to improve or enhance the use of EO in water resource management. This study was undertaken during the Space Generation Congress of the Space Generation Advisory Council in September 2012. The final paper represents the ideas and the recommendations of representatives of the young generation from more ten countries. ©2013 by the International Astronautical Federation.

The challenge of future space systems and services in Europe: Effective answers to local issues with global solutions,"Denis, G.; Pasco, X.","This paper reviews the challenges and opportunities of market growth for space applications. Up to now, the development of space systems has been mainly driven by global or regional needs or sovereignty missions. The global dimension of satellites fits perfectly the needs of customers requiring a global coverage. Meteorology, operational oceanography, TV broadcast or Global Navigation Systems are good examples. In those domains, either the needs are wide enough or the communities of users are well structured. Main customers were able until now to invest in a proprietary capacity or to fund a significant part of the infrastructure. New elements shape today's landscape: - The budgetary constraints affecting many countries weaken this model. - The increasing competition and the emergence of new players. - New operational needs are more and more challenging (e.g. real time surveillance of wide areas) and require-dedicated capacities, while the users demand is fragmented and spread over the world. Meeting the performance requirements can justify a collective approach with capacity sharing. So far collective solutions have been hampered by the reluctance of the governments to share exclusive and sovereign responsibilities. The market of space applications is thus facing a general challenge regarding future growth: cost-effective solutions can be developed and operated only if the user base is consolidated. Beyond technical issues, this paper summarises the findings of recent studies on the business cases and governance of space systems. Assessing examples in Europe and worldwide, the paper analyses the success factors, relying on a smart combination between: - institutional and commercial assets, - dedicated systems and general purpose systems, - national versus European or international capacities, - with a clear governance and mandate for the coordinating entities. Addressing fragmented markets will likely be the main growth opportunity in the coming years, while usual domains are becoming renewal markets. There is an opportunity for the services activity. Nevertheless, the main focus of this analysis is the space infrastructure and more specifically the satellites for Earth observation, telecommunications and navigation applications. The service dimension is addressed through its potential impact on the long term sustainability of space systems. International cooperation plays definitely a major role. The successful implementation of large capacities will depend on the cooperation between two, three or more stakeholders and will be a lengthy process. In conclusion, the paper emphasises the importance of raising awareness and promoting best practices. ©2013 by the International Astronautical Federation.

"Management of fishing of the broadband anchovy (Anchoviella lepidentostole) (Fowler, 1911), in south São Paulo state, Brazil ","Mendonça, J.T.; Sobrinhob, R.P.","The broadband anchovy (Anchoviella lepidentostole) is one of the most important fishery resources for economic and social development of Iguape City and for the whole of the south coast of São Paulo state.

In order to conduct this study, production data and catch per unit effort (CPUE) data from the 1998-2000 period have been collected, and the characterisation of the activity has also been done. A decline in broadband anchovy abundance had been observed in the region up until 2004, when a new regulation was implemented, in an attempt to recover the resource, with the establishment of closed season fishing (defeso) during the catch season, and adjustments in the employed fishing gear. The results have shown a recovery of the abundance of broadband anchovy throughout the 2005-2010 period, showing thus far that the measures taken for the maintenance of the resource have been successful. The activity has been managed through discussions involving people from the fishing sector in order to determine the controversial actions to be taken, that are hard to enforce.

Strategies for moving towards equity in recruitment of rural and Aboriginal research participants.,"Wong, S.T.; Wu, L.; Boswell, B.; Housden, L.; Lavoie, J.","Equitable recruitment strategies, designed to ensure improved opportunities to participate in the research, are needed to include First Nations (FN) communities. The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities.",2013,,Rural and remote health,13,2,2453,,,,#20966,Wong 2013,,
Environmental aspects of hydrocarbon production in West Arctic Basin,"Kuznetsov, Y.","The Russian portion of the West Arctic Shelf (including the Barents Sea, Pechora Bay and Kara Sea) contains over 75% (8.2 billion tons of reference fuel) of the proved hydrocarbon reserves of the whole Russian offshore. The Norwegian continental shelf also bears significant oil and gas reserves distributed among three big water areas: continental shelves of the North, Norwegian and Barents Seas (35%, 36% and 29% respectively). The recoverable hydrocarbon reserves of the Norwegian continental shelf according to the data from Norwegian Petroleum Directorate currently are estimated as 3.4 billion tons of reference fuel. The West Arctic Shelf contains significant oil and gas reserves. Their uniqueness has already been proved through discovering gigantic gas fields such as Shtokman field in the Barents Sea, Rusanov and Leningrad ones in the Kara Sea, big Prirazlomnoe and Dolginskoe gas and oil fields in the Pechora Bay. Hydrocarbon discoveries in the Norwegian sector of the Barents Sea have been made in Snovit oil and gas field and Goliath oil field. A comprehensive estimation of the geological and technical aspects of the environmental safety in hydrocarbon field exploration and operation requires long-term efforts from a big team of experts in different specialties. The author has made an attempt to briefly summarize the state of the problem and outline the ways to solve it. Environment surveys showed that the West Arctic Basin is predominantly influenced by the cold and clean water of the Arctic Ocean. It helps bottom zone self-cleaning. Elevated concentrations of few pollutants have been recorded in the coastal zones of the Kola Peninsula. The benthic ecosystems are naturally unimpaired. Thus, the West Arctic Basin (except few little areas near the Kola Peninsula and Island of Novaya Zemlya) can be considered as an area practically unimpaired by man. Author participated in Caspian environment program as a national expert. He developed a conceptual scheme for environment inspection and monitoring on that territory. The difference between the northern seas and Caspian Sea is that the former are considerably less environmentally burdened. However, the experience of hydrocarbon production in the Gulf of Mexico connected to the world ocean showed that 30-120 tons of oil leaked into the sea during a single well operation. The most environmentally hazardous are force majeur situations - as seen from the BP oilrig fire in the Gulf of Mexico. It was at the stage of exploratory drilling. The wellhead was 1500 m deep, the well proper penetrated approximately 6 km down under the sea bottom. No one in the world has an experience of accident elimination at the depth of one and a half kilometer. 126 workers were on the platform at the moment of the accident. 11 of them died, other 17 workers were wounded. The platform burned and drowned. It descended onto the bottom of the sea. At the same moment - or maybe even earlier - a 1.5 km-long riser with a drilling string inside it fell onto the sea bottom. By the end of April, the leaked oil spot became 78 km long and 63 km wide; afterwards its area grew five times greater and reached 24 thousand square km. It was decided to stop the leak with a heavy reinforced concrete bell, 12 m high and weighting 98 tons. It had an opening (for pumping out oil through a pipe) at its top. But just a single day later there were the same gas-hydrates inside the bell. They were crystalline and occupied a portion of the bell volume. Moreover, there was an apprehension that the gas-hydrates could ignite - so the bell was removed in haste. Finally, they started pumping out the oil on May 16. The oil was injected into a tanker floating in the vicinity of the oilrig. The first days the tanker received up to 800 thousand liters of oil. Any way, the potential flow rate of that well (all valves removed and oil extraction stopped) corresponding to these estimations must be 15-20 or at least 10-12 thousand tons of oil a day. No land wells can have such flow rates. Compare to West Siberian wells having flow rates over 1 ton a day: they are considered minimum profitable, but they are still operated even when they produce just one tenth of that.

Helisoma trivolvus (SAY) as an assessment organism in algal community composition studies,"Coogan, M.A.","The algal grazing nature and relatively high lipid content of specific aquatic snail species results in aquatic gastropods being a logical choice for ecological, toxicological, and conservation studies in both freshwater and marine systems. Helisoma trivolvus (Say), a relatively ubiquitous North American freshwater gastropod, has been used extensively in ecological and toxicological investigations, as is evidenced by bioaccumulation studies of lipophilic contaminants such as triclosan and triclocarban. This paper takes an ecological approach to using aquatic gastropods and investigates a unique experimental design for community composition studies of regional freshwater algal species. When H. trivolvus is exposed to temporary dehydration, it exists within a state of estivation with a resultant reduction in basal metabolism and an ultimate rendering of digestive materials relatively intact. As a grazer of periphyton and filamentous macroalgal species, H. trivolvus can be caged within a defined aquatic region and allowed to graze during a 48 hour time period. Following grazing and estivation due to dehydration over a 48 - 72 hour time period, resultant and released fecal samples can then be prepared and microscopically analyzed for algal composition. Using this method, diatom frustules and filamentous algal fragments are able to be easily identified and quantified. In this capacity, H. trivolvus is able to elucidate algal composition studies by participating in a controlled and easily-modifiable experimental design. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Assessing high-resolution analysis of surface heat fluxes in the Gulf Stream region,"Jin, X.; Yu, L.","A satellite-based global analysis of high-resolution (0.25°) ocean surface turbulent latent and sensible heat fluxes was developed by the objectively analyzed air-sea fluxes (OAFlux) project. Resolving air-sea flux down to the order to 0.25° is critical for the description of the air-sea interaction on mesoscale scales. In this study, we evaluate the high-resolution product in depicting air-sea exchange in the eddy-rich Gulf Stream region. Two approaches were used for evaluation, one is point-to-point validation based on six moored buoys in the region, and another is basin-scale analysis in terms of wave number spectra and probability density functions. An intercomparison is also carried out between OAFlux-0.25°, OAFlux-1°, and four atmospheric reanalyses. Results indicate that OAFlux-0.25° is able to depict sharp oceanic fronts and has the best performance among the six participating products in comparison with buoy measurements. The mean OAFlux-0.25° differences in latent and sensible heat flux with respect to the buoy are 7.6 Wm-2 (7.7%) with root-mean-square (RMS) difference of 44.9 Wm-2, and 0.0 Wm-2 with RMS difference of 19.4 Wm-2, respectively. Large differences are primarily due to mismatch in SST between gridded data and point measurements when strong spatial gradients are presented. The wave number spectra and decorrelation length scale analysis indicate OAFlux-0.25° depicts eddy variability much better than OAFlux-1° and the four reanalyses; however, its capability in detecting eddies with smaller scale still needs to be improved. Among the four reanalyses, CFSR stands out as the best in comparison with OAFlux-0.25°. © 2013. American Geophysical Union.

Improving seismic hazard assessment in New England through the use of surficial geologic maps and expert analysis,"Becker, L.R.; Patriarco, S.P.; Marvinney, R.G.; Thomas, M.A.; Mabee, S.B.; Fratto, E.S.","In New England, earthquakes pose a risk to the built environment. Emergency preparedness and mitigation planning are prudent in this region as older unreinforced masonry buildings and numerous critical facilities are common. New England state geological surveys cooperate with the Northeast States Emergency Consortium (NESEC) to improve risk communication with emergency managers. To that end, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont employed surficial geologic maps, deglaciation history, knowledge of the glacial stratigraphy, and professional judgment to reclassify surficial geologic material units into one of the five National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) site classifications (A, B, C, D, and E). These new classifications were used as a substitute for the HAZards U.S. Multi- Hazard (HAZUS-MH) site class value of ""D,"" which is used throughout New England as a default value. In addition, coding of surficial geologic materials for the five NEHRP site classifications was compared with classifications using the Wald methodology, a method that uses a slope analysis as a proxy for shear-wave velocity estimates. Comparisons show that coding to site classes using the Wald methodology underestimates categories A (high-velocity shear-wave materials, least relative hazard) and E (lowest-velocity shear-wave materials, greatest relative hazard) when evaluated side by side with coding done with the aid of surficial geologic maps. North of the glacial limit, derangement of drainage resulted in extensive ponding of meltwaters and the subsequent deposition of thick sequences of lacustrine mud. Inundation by the sea immediately following deglaciation in New England resulted in the deposition of spatially extensive and locally thick sequences of glacial marine mud. Surficial geologic maps better capture this circumstance when compared with the Wald topographic slope analysis. Without the use of surficial geologic maps, significant areas of New England will be incorrectly classified as being more stable than the site conditions that actually exist. By employing surficial geologic information, we project an improved accuracy for HAZUS-MH earthquake loss estimations, providing local and regional emergency managers with more accurate information for locating and prioritizing earthquake planning, preparedness, and mitigation projects to reduce future losses. © 2012 The Geological Society of America.

"Biodegradation of organic pollutants, reduction of metals and energy generation involving Clostridium Sp.","Guerrero-Barajas, C.","The role of the genus Clostridium is of upmost importance in environmental biotechnology; the great metabolic diversity that the members of this genus exhibit allows them to participate in biodegradation of organic pollutants, biotransformation of metals and generation of energy. In this review, the following topics will be presented: biodegradation of some relevant organic pollutants such as Azo-dyes, explosives, chlorinated compounds, biotransformation of metals such as Chromium, Vanadium, Iron, Uranium and Plutonium, and the generation of energy in Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) including the main metabolic features of some members of the Clostridium genus involved in these processes. Therefore, some key points in this review include: The Azo-dyes (synthetic dyes) compounds, which are widely used in industry and can be biodegraded under anaerobic conditions by azoreductases, enzymes expressed by some Clostridium sp. A singular dehydrogenase identified in the case of Clostridium perfringens allows to this microorganism the reduction of nitro aromatic compounds as well. The anaerobic biodegradation of nitrogenated compounds including the explosives 2,4,6- trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexahydro- 1,3,5, trinitro- 1,3,5 triazine (RDX) and octahydro-1,3,5,7- tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) are linked to Clostridium nitrophenolicum, which is able to survive in mixtures of the mentioned explosives. Among the several recalcitrant organic pollutants that can be biodegraded by microorganisms belonging to the genus Clostridium are also the chlorinated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, in which case Clostridium bifermentans DPH-1 is known to be capable of dehalorespiration. Successful results on polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) dechlorination involve Clostridium pascui. Reduction of metals and radionuclids is another capability of Clostridia. The mechanisms for these reductions are not completely known in some cases, and both fermentation and respiration have been pointed out for the reductive process. Recently, it has been proposed that Clostridium acetobutylicum may reduce U(VI) enzymatically. Some of the most cited metals and radionuclids that several Clostridium sp. can reduce are Fe (III), by Clostridium celerecrescens, V(V), by Clostridium pasteurianum and U(VI) by Clostridium acetobutylicum. A novel strategy for energy generation taking advantage of microorganisms is the microbial fuel cell (MFC). Some of the most studied microorganisms used in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) include Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium acetobutylicum. Most recently, an interesting application of MFCs is to couple the energy generation to anaerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons, a process that also involves several microorganisms belonging to the genus Clostridium. Certainly, the genus Clostridium offers a great source of bacteria that ensures a physiology complex enough to be taken advantage of in environmental biotechnology; however, there are still places to look at in which Clostridium sp. can be found and therefore, capabilities to be discovered. This may be true when exploring microbial niches in extreme environments such as the Antarctica, where a microorganism closely related to Clostridium subterminale exhibited the capability of producing an extracellular protease, active in a wide range of pH. On the other hand, there is relatively little information of Clostridium sp. in marine environments around the world, and this is particularly true in thermophilic marine environments such as hydrothermal vents, for which only two Clostridium species have been reported: Clostridium caminithermale and Clostridium tepidiprofundi. Along these lines, a microorganism closely related to Clostridium ganghwense has been related to biodegradation of trichloroethylene (TCE) when enrichment cultures of hydrothermal vents sediments were cultivated under sulfate-reducing conditions. Finally, in sight of the valuable biological tool that this genus is, emerging new contaminants such as ""green solvents"" have also been evaluated on the toxicitythat may exert on Clostridium sp.; this is recent, and may become a great concern in a near future, since for the scientific community dedicated to biodegradation and bioremediation, the fact that some members of Clostridium are ubiquitous is definitely useful. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Symbiosis of sea anemones and hermit crabs in temperate seas,"Antoniadou, C.; Vafeiadou, A.-M.; Chintiroglou, C.","Symbiosis, according to its initial meaning, refers to the biological interaction between two organisms living in close association. However, this definition is rather controversial, with the term being often used generically, since the outcome can vary across a continuum from negative to positive interactions. Symbiosis is a widespread phenomenon in temperate marine communities, and the association between sea anemones and hermit crabs belongs to the most common cases, being a familiar example of mutualism. In these latter specific cases of interactions gastropod shells are involved as prerequisite, since they provide both refuge for hermit crabs and substratum for the settlement of sea anemones; thus, shell resource availability is crucial for the establishment of this particular type of symbiosis. Within this context the present study aims to integrate the results of various studies to provide a general review about the symbiotic interactions of sea anemones and hermit crabs in temperate seas, addressing the following issues: (1) clarify the relevant terminology, which is differently interpreted by various authors; (2) provide a general description of the sea anemone -hermit crab association, as most studies examine separately the species involved and not the symbiosis as a whole; (3) assess the diversity and distribution of sea anemone -hermit crab associations in temperate seas, also incorporating gastropod shells and their availability, which although crucial, has been only little investigated; (4) address the behavioural patterns of both symbionts for the establishment of the symbiosis, including as well the behavioural plasticity of hermit crab related to shell resource utilization, and (5) report relevant information about co-evolution of the participant species, referring to the existing hypotheses on the evolution of the symbiosis, underlining its importance. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Monitoring the condition of the estuaries of the United States: The national coastal assessment experience,"Summers, J.K.; Engle, V.D.; Smith, L.M.; Harwell, L.M.; Macauley, J.M.; Harvey, J.E.","Coastal waters in the United States include estuaries, bays, sounds, coastal wetlands, coral reefs, intertidal zones, mangrove and kelp forests, seagrass meadows, and coastal ocean and upwelling areas. These coastal areas encompass a wide diversity of ecosystems that result from the tidal exchanges between freshwater rivers and saline ocean water that occur within coastal estuaries. Coastal habitats provide spawning grounds, nursery areas, shelter, and food sources critical for the survival of finfish, shellfish, birds, and other wildlife populations that contribute substantially to the economic health of the Nation. Section 305(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report periodically on the condition of the nation's coastal waters. As part of this process, coastal states provide valuable information about the condition of their coastal resources to EPA; however, because the individual states use a variety of approaches for data collection and evaluation, it has been difficult to compare this information among states or on a national basis. In 1999-to better address questions about national coastal condition-EPA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), agreed to participate in a multiagency effort to assess the condition of the nation's coastal resources. The agencies chose to assess condition using nationally consistent monitoring surveys to minimize the problems created by compiling data collected using multiple approaches. The results of these assessments were compiled periodically into a series of National Coastal Condition Reports (NCCR). This series of reports contains the most comprehensive ecological assessment of the condition of U.S. coastal bays and estuaries. This chapter describes the planning, execution and communication of the National Coastal Assessments. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Comparative microbiological characterization of the urban sewage sludge and residual marine biomass along romanian black sea coast,"Ticuţa, N.-P.; Bogdan, N.-P.; Gabriela-Mihaela, P.; Rodica, S.; Aurelia, M.","Pathogenic microorganisms can contaminate the environment. The role of these factors in producing transmissible diseases was proven by a number of authors long before the discovery of pathogenic microbial agents. Accepting the notion of bacterial contamination indicator of environmental, the necessity to establish when a nonpathogen or conditionally pathogen germ can be indicator appeared. If for pathogen germs their mere presence in the environment may be enough to consider the researched factor as dangerous, in reality the true is represented also by the number of present pathogens. For indicators germs establishing the number through quantitative and qualitative bacteriological examinations are necessary. In this aim, a comparative study of two residual biomass microbial charges (sewage sludge and marine biomass) was realized in order to assess the possibilities of combining them and identifying the optimal level of participation of each component for achieving a potential biocomposite fertilizer formula. The microbial loading problem has been the priority of our study because this is the most important factor involved in improvement of two biological wastes for agriculture purpose. Marine biomass (macroalgae and zoobenthos) along the seashore from Cap Singol of Constanta to the southern extremity of the Romanian Black Sea Coast consist of green, brown and red macroalgae, raw plant material Danube river origin, benthic marine organisms as crustacean decapods, bivalves and gastropods (mussels and Rapana sp.), shell material and the sewage sludge coming from urban wastewater treatment plants, were collected monthly in the last two years. Analysis methodology applied to residual marine biomass and sewage sludge has been based on aqueous extracts from dried samples. The follows physical-chemical parameters for the biomass extracts have been studied: moisture, ash, total nitrogen, total protein, total lipids and carbohydrates. For the microbial charge determination, the serial dilutions method has been applied and the qualitative and quantitative identification by the colony forming units reported to the volume unit (total coliforms, fecal coliforms, total streptococcus, fecal streptococcus, Shigella, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter spp.), was realized. The comparative microbiological characterization assessed that the two residual biomasses could be successfully recovered as separately or mixed in the aim to obtain a new biocomposite fertilizer with decreased bacterial charge. © SGEM2012 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM Published by STEF92 Technology Ltd.",2012,,,5,,177-184,,,,#20982,Ticuţa 2012,,
The impacts of the Panama Canal expansion on world cotton trade,"Costa, R.; Rosson, P.","The U.S. cotton industry is highly dependent on foreign markets. It is important for the U.S. industry to remain competitive with foreign suppliers such as Brazil, India and Uzbekistan. One of the major factors that will affect the efficiency, distribution and competitiveness of U.S. cotton will be the expansion of the Panama Canal. With sea freight the fastest growing mode of transportation, the number and size of vessels that are able to pass through the Canal will increase after the expansion is completed in 2014. In summary, taking into account the cost structure, transit time, and the Panama Canal tolls, when compared to the intermodal option, the expansion is expected to reduce maritime costs for shipments from the East Coast ports (e.g. Savannah port) to East Asia (China) by about $140/TEU, a 28 percent reduction of the current total cost of $490/TEU. A spatial, intertemporal equilibrium model of the international cotton sector was utilized to evaluate the effects of the expansion on the world cotton industry, with more emphasis given to the U.S. cotton industry. By assuming that the canal expansion will be completed in 2014, three scenarios assuming different reductions in ocean freight rates from the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic ports to Asian and Pacific importing countries are analyzed. In general, all scenarios suggested that cotton exports to Gulf and Atlantic ports would increase considerably with the port of Savannah leading the way. On the other hand, the Long Beach - Los Angeles ports would decrease its participation in total U.S. cotton exports significantly. Overall, the percentage of U.S. cotton exports via the Panama Canal relative to the total U.S. cotton exports would increase. Furthermore, total U.S. cotton exports were expected to increase due to the expansion. However, in relative terms, the maximum amount which the U.S. total exports would increase is equivalent to a 2.2 percent increase. As for the other competing countries, for all analyzed scenarios, these losses in exports, prices, and revenues are very modest in relative terms. © (2012) by the Transportation Research Forum.

Chlorhexidine gluconate reduces transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus USA300 among marine recruits,"Whitman, T.J.; Schlett, C.D.; Grandits, G.A.; Millar, E.V.; Mende, K.; Hospenthal, D.R.; Murray, P.R.; Tribble, D.R.","Background. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pulsed-field type (PFT) USA300 causes skin and soft tissue infections in military recruits and invasive disease in hospitals. Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) is used to reduce MRSA colonization and infection. The impact of CHG on the molecular epidemiology of MRSA is not known. Objective. To evaluate the impact of 2% CHG-impregnated cloths on the molecular epidemiology of MRSA colonization. Design. Cluster-randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Setting. Marine Officer Candidate School, Quantico, Virginia, in 2007. Participants. Military recruits. Intervention. Thrice-weekly application of CHG-impregnated or control (Comfort Bath; Sage) cloths over the entire body. Measurements. Baseline and serial (every 2 weeks) nasal and/or axillary swab samples were assessed for MRSA colonization. Molecular analysis was performed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Results. During training, 77 subjects (4.9%) acquired MRSA, 26 (3.3%) in the CHG group and 51 (6.5%) in the control group (P = .004). When analyzed for PFT, 24 subjects (3.1%) in the control group but only 6 subjects (0.8%) in the CHG group (P = .001) had USA300. Of the 167 colonizing isolates recovered from 77 subjects, 99 were recovered from the control group, including USA300 (40.4%), USA800 (38.4%), USA1000 (12.1%), and USA100 (6.1%), and 68 were recovered from the CHG group, including USA800 (51.5%), USA100 (23.5%), and USA300 (13.2%). Conclusions. CHG decreased the transmission of MRSA-more specifically, USA300-among military recruits. In addition, USA300 and USA800 outcompeted other MRSA PFTs at incident colonization. Future studies should evaluate the broad-based use of CHG to decrease transmission of USA300 in hospital settings. © 2012 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

"Difficult asthma: Assessment and management, part 2","Fanta, C.H.; Long, A.A.","Patients with severe asthma have considerable morbidity related to their asthma and are at risk for serious, life-threatening exacerbations. Their management requires an intensive and comprehensive approach, including attention to reducing exposure to environmental inciters of airway inflammation and triggers of symptoms, patient education (including an asthma action plan), and opportunity for close patient-provider communication. Approved medical options include the lipoxygenase inhibitor, zileuton; the anti-immunoglobulin E monoclonal antibody, omalizumab; and bronchial thermoplasty. Nonapproved interventions of potential benefit are ultrahigh-dose inhaled corticosteroids, anticholinergic bronchodilators (tiotropium), macrolide antibiotics, and vitamin D supplementation for the vitamin D-deficient patient. Potentially toxic, ""steroid-sparing"" therapies such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and etanercept are best reserved for patients participating in clinical trials. Recognition of specific subtypes of patients with therapy-resistant asthma permits more targeted treatment approaches, such as for aspirinsensitive asthma, persistent eosinophilic asthma, asthma complicated by allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, asthma with persistent airflow obstruction, and asthma with life-threatening (near fatal) asthmatic attacks. Novel therapies based on an improved understanding of the pathobiology of therapy-resistant asthma are greatly needed.

Considering a species-loss domino-effect before endangered species legislation and protected area implementation,"Hintz, W.D.; Garvey, J.E.","Regulatory legislation by governments is essential for facilitating the recovery of endangered or threatened species. Protecting commercially exploited species, in particular, requires painstaking cooperation among vested parties. However, rules protecting one species may be detrimental to others. If an exploited species is only protected in a portion of its range, exploitative efforts may divert to unprotected portions or similarly valuable species. As a result, the good intentions of protecting species in a limited fashion may manifest a species-loss domino-effect. We illustrate a species-loss domino-effect using a current example from the Mississippi River basin of the United States, where roe fisheries (for caviar) have cascaded because of strict regulations and collapses of sturgeon stocks in Europe and Asia. In the Mississippi River basin the limited protection of a commercially important sturgeon species may increase exploitation in unprotected river reaches and threaten other economically important fishes. Although a species-loss domino-effect is delineated herein using an example from a freshwater fishery in the central United States, the concept should be considered and applied to terrestrial and marine species worldwide. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",2012,,Biodiversity and Conservation,21,8,2017-2027,,10.1007/s10531-012-0293-3,,#20996,Hintz 2012,,
An oral health literacy intervention for Indigenous adults in a rural setting in Australia,"Parker, E.J.; Misan, G.; Chong, A.; Mills, H.; Roberts-Thomson, K.; Horowitz, A.M.; Jamieson, L.M.","Background: Indigenous Australians suffer substantially poorer oral health than their non-Indigenous counterparts and new approaches are needed to address these disparities. Previous work in Port Augusta, South Australia, a regional town with a large Indigenous community, revealed associations between low oral health literacy scores and self-reported oral health outcomes. This study aims to determine if implementation of a functional, context-specific oral health literacy intervention improves oral health literacy-related outcomes measured by use of dental services, and assessment of oral health knowledge, oral health self-care and oral health- related self-efficacy. Methods/design: This is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that utilises a delayed intervention design. Participants are Indigenous adults, aged 18 years and older, who plan to reside in Port Augusta or a nearby community for the next two years. The intervention group will receive the intervention from the outset of the study while the control group will be offered the intervention 12 months following their enrolment in the study. The intervention consists of a series of five culturally sensitive, oral health education workshops delivered over a 12 month period by Indigenous project officers. Workshops consist of presentations, hands-on activities, interactive displays, group discussions and role plays. The themes addressed in the workshops are underpinned by oral health literacy concepts, and incorporate oral health-related self-efficacy, oral health-related fatalism, oral health knowledge, access to dental care and rights and entitlements as a patient. Data will be collected through a self-report questionnaire at baseline, at 12 months and at 24 months. The primary outcome measure is oral health literacy. Secondary outcome measures include oral health knowledge, oral health self-care, use of dental services, oral health-related self-efficacy and oral health-related fatalism. Discussion: This study uses a functional, context-specific oral health literacy intervention to improve oral health literacy-related outcomes amongst rural-dwelling Indigenous adults. Outcomes of this study will have implications for policy and planning by providing evidence for the effectiveness of such interventions as well as provide a model for working with Indigenous communities. © 2012 Parker et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2012,,BMC Public Health,12,1,,,10.1186/1471-2458-12-461,,#20997,Parker 2012,,
"Physical demands during the hauling of fishing nets for artisan fishing using rafts in beach of Ponta Negra, Natal-Brasil","Jaeschke, A.; Saldanha, M.C.W.","The current article aims to analyse the activity and the repercussions in the health of the artisan fishermen who use rafts in the urban Beach of Ponta Negra in Natal - RN, with emphasis on the physical demands at the step of hauling the nets from the ocean. It has been taken as a reference the methodology of Work Ergonomic Analysis-WEA. 21 fishermen participated in the study (50% of the population). It was used applying observational techniques and methodologies (open and sistematic observations and simulations) interactional ( social and economic questionnaire, conversational actions, verbalizations, self confrontations and collective analysis) and health assessment (static postural assessment, movement flexibility of flexo extension of the shoulder and the ischiotibial muscle, lumbar region and hang grip. Applying the diagram of painful areas and the Nordic Questionnaire of mucleskeletal symptoms). The results were submeted to restitutions and validations with the raftmen. The hauling of the nets represents a high muscleskeletal risk, joining physical effort, adopting forced postures with the rotation of the spine and movement repetition, mainly flexo extension of vertebral spine, aggravated by the demand of strength fo the stabilizing muscles of the human body to keep the poise. The impacts of the activity of the fisherman of Ponta Negra, related to postures and strength demand were observed in the postural assessment and are related to the activity. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

Climatotherapy at the Dead Sea: An effective treatment modality for atopic dermatitis with significant positive impact on quality of life,"Adler-Cohen, C.; Czarnowicki, T.; Dreiher, J.; Ruzicka, T.; Ingber, A.; Harari, M.","Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) has an appreciable effect on quality of life. Improving the quality of life of AD patients is a priority. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Dead Sea climatotherapy (DSC) as a treatment of AD and its influence on the quality of life of these patients. Methods: Forty-nine adult patients with AD treated during the years 2009-2010 at the Deutsches Medizinisches Zentrum Medical Center participated in this prospective study. Climatotherapy was administered in accordance with a computer-designed protocol and included gradually increased sun exposure after a sea bath. Severity of AD was evaluated using the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index. Patient quality of life was evaluated using Skindex-29. Statistical analysis was performed using a paired t test and Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: After treatment, the mean SCORAD value improved by 39 points (P < 0.001). The overall Skindex-29 score improved by a mean value of 33 points (P < 0.001). The pretreatment SCORAD, duration of AD, and maximal daily sun exposure predicted the posttreatment SCORAD values. Pretreatment Skindex-29 and patient age predicted the posttreatment Skindex-29 in a multiple linear regression model. Conclusions: Dead Sea climatotherapy provides an effective treatment modality for AD by improving the patient's skin condition and quality of life. © 2012 American Contact Dermatitis Society.

Adapting Stanford's chronic disease self-management program to Hawaii's multicultural population,"Tomioka, M.; Braun, K.L.; Compton, M.; Tanoue, L.","Purpose of the study: Stanford's Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) has been proven to increase patients' ability to manage distress. We describe how we replicated CDSMP in Asian and Pacific Islander (API) communities. Design and Methods: We used the ""track changes"" tool to deconstruct CDSMP into its various components (e.g., recruitment and staffing) and the ""adaptation traffic light"" to identify allowable modifications to the original program. We monitored local leaders' fidelity of delivery of CDSMP and tracked participants' attendance, satisfaction, and 6-month outcomes. Results: Between July 2007 and February 2010, 584 completed a CDSMP workshop. Baseline and 6-month data were available for 422 (72%), including 53 Caucasians, 177 Asians, and 194 Pacific Islanders. All 3 groups realized significant decreases in social and role activity limitations and significant increases in communication with physicians. Asians and Pacific Islanders also realized significant increases in self-rated health and time spent engaging in stretching/strengthening exercise. Asians also reported significant reductions in health distress and self-reported physician visits and increases in time spent in aerobic exercise, ability to cope with symptoms, and self-efficacy. Implications: Our experience suggests that CDSMP can be modified for increased cultural appropriateness for API communities while maintaining the key components responsible for behavior change. © The Author 2011.

Part III summary: A systemic approach - modeling and restoration,"Gardener, M.; Wolff, M.","Part III looks at the reasons why research and modeling at the scale of the entire ecosystem (e.g. socio-ecosystem) is fundamental to understand complex system functioning and to help optimizing management for both biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of resources. Rachel Atkinson and colleagues review eradication as a tool for invasive species management in Galápagos. They report on the history of species introductions in Galápagos and show that the rate of introductions steadily increased since the 1830s, rising most rapidly during the last 50 years. In 2008, the tally of introduced terrestrial species was 1, 445 including 870 plants, 536 invertebrates, 30 vertebrates and ten diseases. Of these introduced species, many have invaded native ecosystems. Vertebrate invasions were the first to cause impact and alarm in the latter half of the twentieth century. These have been followed by plant and invertebrate invasions that now cover huge areas, particularly in the highland regions of the inhabited islands, and further invasions are expected in future. The authors encourage the reader to consider potentially positive and negative impacts of eradication programs to the whole ecosystem, not just iconic species. They consider four main criteria before deciding to attempt eradication: (1) strategic-operational; (2) biological; (3) economic; and (4) socio-political. They list the following important considerations: (1) an eradication operation should not be attempted if reintroduction cannot be prevented; (2) the rate of removal must exceed the rate of population increase; (3) species with limited distributions, that are easily detectable, with a short-lived dormant stage (e.g. a seed or egg bank), and that have a known control method for reproductive individuals, are prime candidates for eradication; (4) eradications, especially when carried out at the early stages of invasion, are cost-effective and theoretically neat solutions to prevent the future or current impact of invasive species. Additionally, eradications should not be started if there is insufficient funding to address unforeseen consequences of the operation on ecosystem dynamics. Another frequently overlooked requirement is the need for governmental and public support for all aspects of the project from the start in order to ensure that there are no barriers to the program from beginning to end. The tool of eradication is attractive to both donors and managers alike, as there is a measurable outcome and a definite endpoint to the project. However, there are limits to the use of eradication as a tool for conservation. The authors discuss these limits, analyzing 57 eradication projects of vertebrates, invertebrates and vascular plants from 1961 to present. Of these, 27 have been successful, 20 unsuccessful and ten are ongoing. The majority of successes were of large vertebrates, whereas most plant and invertebrate eradication attempts were unsuccessful. They found common trends in project successes and failures with operational, biological, economic and social criteria all contributing. They discuss the future of eradications and the alternatives in Galápagos. Matthias Wolff and coworkers use a trophic modeling approach to integrate ecological and fisheries data for a holistic description of the Galápagos Marine Reserve (GMR) ecosystem and to evaluate the effect of the banning of industrial fishing in the GMR in 1998 and the coinciding El Niño event. For the construction of their baseline flow model they used data from the late 1990s when industrial fishery was still in place. Estimated pre-1998 catch volumes in the GMR were in the realms of average catches in other oceanic and shelf systems, hence, the model was considered to be realistic. Top order predators were the warmblooded toothed whales, but large pelagic fish and cephalopods also played a prominent role. Simulations suggest that the GMR has undergone a substantial recovery process of large pelagic fish and sharks since industrial fishery was banned 12 years ago. According to the model simulations, most large pelagic fish would have - under normal environmental conditions - attained 10-20% stock increase after only two years after the fishery ban, concordant with literature findings showing that marine reserve closure is almost immediately effective in less than two years. Nevertheless, the El Niño event suppressed this rapid response for a further two to three years, suggesting that the bottom-up effect on the system of reduced primary productivity was stronger than the top-down effect from the release in fishing pressure. The first species predicted to surpass the pre-El Niño reference level was the yellowfin tuna, followed by wahoo, dolphin fish and sailfish. Owing to their slow population turnover rates, sharks followed later. Juvenile sharks are predicted to maintain reduced biomass throughout the time due to strong control by increased levels of top predators. Sea lions, cormorants, penguins and sea turtles needed the whole 12-year period to rebuild their populations. The authors emphasize that the disruption of the system by the El Niño impacted in the medium term (three to nine years), leading to higher biomasses of large pelagic fish predators than under the same fishery conditions without the El Niño impact. This suggests that, since predator biomass is reduced during the El Niño, prey populations find an “open loophole” to proliferate first and are then followed by their predators in a Lotka-Volterra fashion. It then takes several years for the system to normalize. Long-term monitoring data for marine mammals, birds and sea turtles confirmed the El Niño driven population reductions simulated by the model. Marjan van den Belt presents mediated modeling (MM) as a computer-based tool that can facilitate the participation of diverse stakeholders in the identification and valuation of ecosystem services from a conservation and human perspective. Systems thinking (the use of causal diagrams) and system dynamics (quantitative representations of feedback loops and time lags to understand systems) provide the underlying modeling philosophy. MM is presented as a decision support tool that can feed into all phases of adaptive management: envisioning; assessment; planning; implementation; and monitoring. The discussion between the stakeholders involved is interpreted by a mediated modeler and reflected back into the dialogue for all participants in real time. The integration of ecology, economics and social issues for sustainable development is often considered a normative objective in a MM process. In her contribution, Marjan uses a first pass example of how MM - based on a model produced using the STELLA software - could work in Galápagos to demonstrate how this tool could promote stakeholder dialogue. © 2012 selection and editorial material, Matthias Wolff and Mark Gardener; individual chapters, the contributors.",2012,,The Role of Science for Conservation,,,240-242,,10.4324/9780203126790-23,,#21006,Gardener 2012,,
Indigenous vendor qualification for thermal insulation coating for deepwater pipelines,"Chukwujindu, I.; Olanruwaju, O.; Andrews, K.; Akpovir, M.","The purpose of this paper is to discuss capacity and capability verification exercise conducted for qualifying a Nigerian-based coating vendor for application of anti-corrosion coating (three layer polypropylene) and insulation coating (five layer polypropylene) on line pipes for risers and flowlines to be installed offshore (deepwater) Nigeria. The search for new oil and gas discoveries and increasing production volumes has driven oil companies to deeper ocean depths posing significant and unique challenges. A major challenge faced in deepwater fields is producing high pressure and high temperature reserves with significant subsea infrastructures and tens of kilometers of tie-backs to production facilities. This need to operate at greater depths with longer subsea tiebacks requires a high reliability method to address flowline and riser corrosion and insulation (hydrate/wax formation) requirements. The use of engineered pipeline coatings has been identified as the ""first line of defense"" in addressing these challenges, and a cost effective and reliable mitigating strategy. With a possible loss of production or shut-in, the cost of conducting periodic inspections, maintenance and repair work offshore deepwater is enormous such that the reliability of the facilities has a positive impact on the operating expenditure; the right choice of coatings, to prevent external corrosion and reduce the rate of heat transfer from the production fluid to the environment, would help improve the reliability of the risers and flowlines. Industry-wide experience varies in the use of these coatings, with some operators experiencing some significant failures. To avoid these failures, engaging a qualified coating vendor, with the appropriate skill set, knowledge, and experience is critical. In an effort to meet industry standards and ExxonMobil requirements, Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria Limited (EEPNL), with participation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Nigeria Content Development Monitoring Board (NCDMB) identified a Nigerian coating company, Pipe Coaters Nigeria Limited PCN), and conducted a coating qualification exercise for application of anti-corrosion (three layer polypropylene) and insulation (five layer polypropylene) coatings intended for use on Erha North Phase 2 risers and flowlines.

Assessment of regional climate model simulation estimates over the northeast United States,"Rawlins, M.A.; Bradley, R.S.; Diaz, H.F.","Given the coarse scales of coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate models, regional climate models (RCMs) are increasingly relied upon for studies at scales appropriate for many impacts studies. We use outputs from an ensemble of RCMs participating in the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) to investigate potential changes in seasonal air temperature and precipitation between present (1971-2000) and future (2041-2070) time periods across the northeast United States. The models show a consistent modest cold bias each season and are wetter than observations in winter, spring, and summer. Agreement in spatial variability and pattern correlation is good for air temperature and marginal for precipitation. Two methods were used to evaluate robustness of the mid 21st century change projections; one which estimates model reliability to generate multimodel means and assess uncertainty and a second which depicts multimodel projections by separating lack of climate change signal from lack of model agreement. For air temperature we find changes of 2-3C are outside the level of internal natural variability and significant at all northeast grid cells. Signals of precipitation increases in winter are significant region wide. Regionally averaged precipitation changes for spring, summer, and autumn are within the level of natural variability. This study raises confidence in mid 21st century temperature projections across the northeast United States and illustrates the value in comprehensive assessments of regional climate model projections over time and space scales where natural variability may obscure signals of anthropogenically forced changes. © 2012.

High altitude headache and acute mountain sickness at moderate elevations in a military population during battalion-level training exercises,"Norris, J.N.; Viirre, E.; Aralis, H.; Sracic, M.K.; Thomas, D.; Gertsch, J.H.","Few studies have evaluated high altitude headache (HAH) and acute mountain sickness (AMS) in military populations training at moderate (1,500-2,500 m) to high altitudes (>2,500 m). In the current study, researchers interviewed active duty personnel training at Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center. Participants were asked about HAH and AMS symptoms, potential risk factors, and medications used. In a sample of 192 U.S. Navy and Marine Corps personnel, 14.6% reported AMS (Lake Louise Criteria ge;3) and 28.6% reported HAH. Dehydration and recent arrival at altitude (defined as data collected on days 2-3) were significantly associated with AMS; decreased sleep allowance was significantly associated with HAH. Although ibuprofen/Motrin users were more likely to screen positive for AMS, among AMS-positive participants, ibuprofen/Motrin users had decreased likelihood of reporting robust AMS relative to non-ibuprofen/Motrin users (p < 0.01). These results suggest that maintenance of hydration and adequate sleep allowance may be critical performance requirements at altitude. Further, ibuprofen/Motrin may be a reasonable treatment for the symptoms of AMS and HAH, although further study is warranted. © Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S. All rights reserved.",2012,,Military Medicine,177,8,917-923,,10.7205/MILMED-D-12-00007,,#21010,Norris 2012,,
"Relationship between obesity in Korean adolescents and the frequency of alcohol consumption, the amount of alcohol consumed, and the frequency of severe alcohol intoxication","Baek, S.-I.; So, W.-Y.","The purpose of this study is to determine whether the frequency of alcohol consumption, the amount of alcohol consumed, and the frequency of severe alcohol intoxication are related with obesity in Korean adolescents. In 2009, 72,399 students from the 7th to 12th grades participated in the 5th Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBWS-V) project. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to assess whether body mass index (BMI) was associated with the frequency of alcohol consumption, the amount of alcohol consumed, and the frequency of severe alcohol intoxication, after controlling for covariate variables such as age, parent's education level, household economic status, frequency of vigorous and moderate physical activities, and frequency of muscular strength exercises during the week, sedentary lifestyle during the week, mental stress, and sleep duration. No relationship was observed between the frequency of alcohol consumption and body weight in adolescents. However, for boys, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) between becoming overweight and the amount of alcohol consumed was 0.678 (range, 0.534-0.862; p = 0.002) for 2 to <3 bottles of beer and 0.810 (range, 0.674-0.973; p = 0.025) for 3 to <4 bottles of beer. The odds ratio (95% CI) between becoming obese and the amount of alcohol consumed was 0.794 (range, 0.653-0.964; p = 0.020) for 3 to <4 bottles of beer and that between becoming obese and the frequency of severe alcohol intoxication was 0.758 (range, 0.598-0.959; p = 0.021) when alcohol was consumed 1-2 times per month. For girls, the odds ratio (95% CI) between becoming overweight and the amount of alcohol consumed was 0.752 (range, 0.579-0.978; p = 0.033) for 3 to <4 bottles of beer and that between becoming obese and the amount of alcohol consumed was 1.753 (range, 1.033-2.972; p = 0.037) for ≥4 bottles of beer. We conclude that there is no relationship between the frequency of alcohol consumption and becoming overweight or obese.

United Nations convention on the law of the sea: Living resources provisions,"Buck, E.H.","The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOS Convention) was agreed to in 1982, but the United States never became a signatory nation. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations reported the LOS Convention on December 19, 2007. The Senate may choose to address the ambiguities of the LOS Convention with its power to make declarations and statements as provided for in Article 310 of the LOS Convention. Such declarations and statements can be useful in promulgating U.S. policy and putting other nations on notice of U.S. interpretation of the LOS Convention. In the 111th Congress, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs on January 13, 2009, acknowledged that U.S. accession to the LOS Convention would be an Obama Administration priority. Later in this confirmation hearing, Senator John Kerry, the committee chair, confirmed that the LOS Convention would also be a committee priority. A possible benefit of U.S. ratification would be the international community's anticipated positive response to such U.S. action. In addition, early U.S. participation in the development of policies and practices of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, and the International Seabed Authority could help to forestall future problems related to living marine resources. On the other hand, some U.S. interests view U.S. ratification as potentially complicating enforcement of domestic marine regulations, and remain concerned that the LOS Convention's language concerning arbitrary refusal of access to surplus (unallocated) living resources might be a potential source of conflict (in addition to concerns about other provisions of the Convention). These uncertainties reflect the absence of any comprehensive assessment of the social and economic impacts of LOS implementation by the United States. This chapter describes provisions of the LOS Convention relating to living marine resources and discusses how these provisions comport with current U.S. marine policy. As presently understood and interpreted, these provisions generally appear to reflect current U.S. policy with respect to living marine resource management, conservation, and exploitation. Based on these interpretations, they are generally not seen as imposing significant new U.S. obligations, commitments, or encumbrances, while providing several new privileges, primarily related to participation in commissions developing international ocean policy. No new domestic legislation appears to be required to implement the living resources provisions of the LOS Convention. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

For the concluding year of this two-tear Director's Research Initiative (DRI), we designed multimodal (speech and touch) Soldier-swarm control concepts to allow Soldiers to efficiently control a robotic swarm participating in a representative convoy mission. We used a potential field approach for swarm control because it scales easily to large heterogeneous swarms and allows users to dynamically alter swarm behavior by adjusting field parameters. We tested the effectiveness of the swarm controls in a laboratory study using 12 male Marines (volunteers) with a mean age of 19 years. The metacognition results showed that the swarm (which consisted of members fulfilling sentry and explorer functions) could maintain adequate coverage most of the time. Interface results showed that most participants, 58%, used speech commands first almost exclusively, while the remaining used touch commands first. Results can be applied to future swarm and command and control systems. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Thus, 5000 participants will be randomized to-active vitamin D and fish oil placebo, vitamin D placebo and active fish oil, both active vitamin D and fish oil, and both vitamin D and fish oil placebos. Consequently, VITAL will test the individual effects of vitamin D as well as joint effects on the primary outcomes over a 5-year treatment and follow-up period. This trial provides for sufficient dosing and trial duration for convincing hypothesis testing of health effects of vitamin D. Thus, VITAL will make a major contribution to knowledge on the role of both vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in cancer and CVD prevention. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Relationship of body size and mortality among US Asians and Pacific Islanders on dialysis,"Hall, Y.N.; Xu, P.; Chertow, G.M.","Objectives: The influence of body size ondialysis-related mortality among Asians and Pacific Islanders - heterogeneous ethnic groups with dissimilar body compositions - is poorly understood. Our study objective was to compare the relations of body size and mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease of different ethnicities. Design, setting, and participants: We examined data from a cohort of 21,492 adult Asians, Pacific Islanders and non-Hispanic Whites who initiated dialysis during 1995-2003 within California, Hawaii and the US Pacific Islands. Main outcome measure: Time to death through September 22, 2008. Results: Among both men and women, Pacific Islanders were the heaviest and Whites the tallest of the ethnic groups examined. Annual mortality rates were highest among Whites (29.6%), intermediate among Pacific Islanders (18.8%) and lowest among Asians (17.3%). Larger body size was associated with lower mortality among Pacific Islanders, Whites and most Asians on dialysis after adjustment for patient-level sociodemographic and clinical factors, area-based socioeconomic status and geographic clustering. Filipinos were the exception to this rule and showed a trend towards higher mortality with increasing body size. These findings were consistent irrespective of how body size was measured. Conclusions: Larger body size is associated with lower mortality among Pacific Islanders, Whites and most Asians on dialysis. Use of disaggregated ethnicity data may enhance our understanding of how ethnicity- or community- specific factors influence body size, body composition and dialysis-related outcomes in these diverse populations.",2011,,Ethnicity and Disease,21,1,40-46,,,,#21024,Hall 2011,,
Eukaryotic picoplankton in surface oceans,"Massana, R.","The eukaryotic picoplankton is a heterogeneous collection of small protists 1 to 3 μm in size populating surface oceans at abundances of 10 2 to 10 4 cells ml -1. Pigmented cells are important primary producers that are at the base of food webs. Colorless cells are mostly bacterivores and play key roles in channeling bacteria to higher trophic levels as well as in nutrient recycling. Mixotrophy and parasitism are relevant but less investigated trophic paths. Molecular surveys of picoeukaryotes have unveiled a large phylogenetic diversity and new lineages, and it is critical to understand the ecological and evolutionary significance of this large and novel diversity. A main goal is to assess how individuals are organized in taxonomic units and how they participate in ecological processes. Picoeukaryotes are convincingly integral members of marine ecosystems in terms of cell abundance, biomass, activity, and diversity and they play crucial roles in food webs and biogeochemical cycles. © 2011 by Annual Reviews.

Patient preference for autonomy: Does it change as risk rises?,"Kenealy, T.; Goodyear-smith, F.; Wells, S.; Arroll, B.; Jackson, R.; Horsburgh, M.","Background: It is unclear how patient preferences for autonomy vary given different severity of a single condition.Objective: To assess patient preferences for autonomy in making decisions about taking medication to prevent a heart attack, across a wide range of personal calculated cardiovascular disease (CVD) 5-year risk.Methods: Consecutive eligible patients in family practice waiting rooms in Auckland, New Zealand self-completed a questionnaire. Questions related to a hypothetical cardiovascular medication, where risks and benefits were framed from their personal predicted 5-year CVD risk. Participant preference for autonomy was measured by ranking their decision-making preference on 5-point scale from 'doctor only' to 'patient only'.Results: There were 934 participants, with personal predicted 5-year cardiovascular risks that ranged from 5% to 30%. Preference for autonomy decreased as CVD risk increased, after adjustment for age, gender, numeracy and ethnicity. Preference for autonomy increased independently among younger participants, women and those who were more numerate. Compared to participants of European ethnicity, those of Pacific, East Asian and Indian Asian ethnicity were more likely to want the doctor to decide.Conclusions: No combination of predicted risk, demographics or attitudes strongly predicted the preference of an individual patient. Clinicians should therefore seek to understand and confirm each patient's preferences. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.

Optimizing voluntary compliance in marine protected areas: A comparison of recreational fisher and enforcement officer perspectives using multi-criteria analysis,"Read, A.D.; West, R.J.; Haste, M.; Jordan, A.","A comprehensive list of planning criteria for optimizing compliance in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) was compiled and used to compare the views of recreational fishers and compliance officers for facilitating voluntary compliance in the Port Stephens - Great Lakes Marine Park (PSGLMP). Expert working groups were tasked separately with: 1) criteria identification and weighting; 2) scoring of no-take zones; 3) prioritizing and determining uncertainty; and 4) analysis of results and sensitivity testing. Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) revealed that both groups had similar perspectives and recommendations, despite weighting the individual planning criteria differently. Significantly, ""manageability"" scores for no-take zones from MCA appeared to correlate well with past numbers of enforcement actions recorded for each zone. This provides empirical evidence that adopting manageability criteria during the planning of MPAs could lead to a marked increase in voluntary compliance. As a result, greater consideration to compliance planning during MPA design and zoning is recommended in order to optimize voluntary compliance. Whilst the majority of no-take zones in the PSGLMP case study were evaluated as being relatively effective in terms of optimizing voluntary compliance, there remains considerable potential to improve design, management and use of the poorer performing zones. Finally, the study highlighted the value of recreational fisher engagement in MPA planning processes to maximize voluntary compliance and manageability. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2011,,Journal of Environmental Management,92,10,2558-2567,,10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.05.022,,#21029,Read 2011,,
Interannual variability in the oxygen isotopes of atmospheric CO 2 driven by El Niño,"Welp, L.R.; Keeling, R.F.; Meijer, H.A.J.; Bollenbacher, A.F.; Piper, S.C.; Yoshimura, K.; Francey, R.J.; Allison, C.E.; Wahlen, M.","The stable isotope ratios of atmospheric CO 2 ( 18O/ 16O and 13C/ 12C) have been monitored since 1977 to improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle, because biosphere-atmosphere exchange fluxes affect the different atomic masses in a measurable way. Interpreting the 18O/ 16O variability has proved difficult, however, because oxygen isotopes in CO 2 are influenced by both the carbon cycle and the water cycle. Previous attention focused on the decreasing 18O/ 16O ratio in the 1990s, observed by the global Cooperative Air Sampling Network of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory. This decrease was attributed variously to a number of processes including an increase in Northern Hemisphere soil respiration; a global increase in C 4 crops at the expense of C 3 forests; and environmental conditions, such as atmospheric turbulence and solar radiation, that affect CO 2 exchange between leaves and the atmosphere. Here we present 30 years-worth of data on 18O/ 16O in CO 2 from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography global flask network and show that the interannual variability is strongly related to the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. We suggest that the redistribution of moisture and rainfall in the tropics during an El Niño increases the 18O/ 16O ratio of precipitation and plant water, and that this signal is then passed on to atmospheric CO 2 by biosphere-atmosphere gas exchange. We show how the decay time of the El Niño anomaly in this data set can be useful in constraining global gross primary production. Our analysis shows a rapid recovery from El Niño events, implying a shorter cycling time of CO 2 with respect to the terrestrial biosphere and oceans than previously estimated. Our analysis suggests that current estimates of global gross primary production, of 120 petagrams of carbon per year, may be too low, and that a best guess of 150-175 petagrams of carbon per year better reflects the observed rapid cycling of CO 2. Although still tentative, such a revision would present a new benchmark by which to evaluate global biospheric carbon cycling models. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Side-stick force-feel parametric study of a cargo-class helicopter,"Greenfield, A.; Sahasrabudhe, V.","Unique trim side-sticks, and active side sticks with reprogrammable force-feel, are starting to emerge on new fleet aircraft. These new inceptor configurations provide additional capabilities to the helicopter design and handling qualities communities. In order to build industry consensus on the effective use of these, and other evolving technologies, NRTC/CRI has funded a technical area of joint interest (TAJI) research program focused on filling gaps in handling quality requirements for new vehicles and technologies. ADS-33 E, for example, reserves space for side-stick requirements but does not prescribe a particular requirement due to a lack of data. This paper presents the pilot evaluation results of the NRTC/CRI-funded side-stick force feel evaluation tests. The testing took place in the Sikorsky Motion Base simulator in the months of March and April, 2010. The test participants consisted of 4 primary pilots, two from Sikorsky, one from the U.S. Army and one from the Marines. The goal of the study was to investigate the impact of side-stick force feel characteristics on handling qualities. The results of this testing adds to the pre-existing literature on the subject and can be used towards updating handling qualities specifications.

Institutional interplay in networks of marine protected areas with community-based management,"Grilo, C.","Institutional interplay, or the ability of one institution to affect another, is a key feature of multi-level environmental governance that can influence the performance of institutions, such as marine protected areas (MPAs). In the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), MPA networks are being created to meet top-down, internationally defined MPA targets, while simultaneously there is a strong regional focus on bottom-up, community-based marine management. These apparently contradictory trends can be bridged through networks of community-based MPAs. To explore whether institutional interplay affects the success of such MPA networks, and to provide guidance for MPA-making in the WIO, the literature on ten geographically diverse MPA networks with community-based MPAs was reviewed. Because this is a first exploration into the topic, not all causal links between institutional interplay and MPA effectiveness could be confirmed, neither was any indication of interplay-related costs found. However, the analysis suggests that institutional interplay is generally concerned with information exchanges and issues of control and authority and seemed to have positive effects on MPA success. As MPA networks expand in the WIO, MPA practitioners and managers in the region may consider different forms of institutional interplay to be tailored to their specific management and financial contexts. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2011,,Coastal Management,39,4,440-458,,10.1080/08920753.2011.589214,,#21039,Grilo 2011,,
Increases in melanoma among adolescent girls and young women in California: Trends by socioeconomic status and UV radiation exposure,"Hausauer, A.K.; Swetter, S.M.; Cockburn, M.G.; Clarke, C.A.","Objective: During the past 3 decades in the United States, melanoma incidence among non-Hispanic white girls and women aged 15 to 39 years has more than doubled. To better understand which specific subpopulations of girls and women experienced this increase and thereby to target public health interventions, we assessed the relationship between melanoma incidence and small-area level measures of socioeconomic status (SES) and UV radiation (UV-R) exposure. Design: Longitudinal study of California Cancer Registry, US Census, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data from pericensal periods January 1, 1988, through December 31, 1992, and January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2002. Setting: State of California. Participants: A total of 3800 non-Hispanic white girls and women aged 15 to 39 years, in whom 3842 melanomas were diagnosed. Main Outcome Measures: Incidence rates per 100 000 person-years and rate ratios according to SES quintiles and UV-R exposure tertiles. Results: Whereas melanoma rates increased over time for all SES categories, only changes among the highest 3 categories achieved statistical significance. UV radiation was significantly and positively associated with melanoma incidence only among adolescent girls and young women in the 2 highest quintiles ranked by SES, which suggests that SES is not a proxy for UV-R exposure. Those living in neighborhoods with the highest SES and UV-R categories had 80.0% higher rates of melanoma than those in neighborhoods in the lowest categories (rate ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.01). Conclusions: Understanding the ways that SES and UV-R exposure work together to influence melanoma incidence is important for planning effective prevention and educational efforts. Interventions should target adolescent girls and young women living in high SES and high UV-R neighborhoods because they have experienced a significantly greater increase in disease burden. ©2011 American Medical Association.

Indigenous cultural training for health workers in Australia,"Downing, R.; Kowal, E.; Paradies, Y.","Purpose: Culturally inappropriate health services contribute to persistent health inequalities. This article reviews approaches to indigenous cultural training for health workers and assesses how effectively they have been translated into training programmes within Australia. Data sources: CINAHL PLUS, MEDLINE, Wiley InterScience, ATSIHealth and ProQuest. Study selection: The review focuses on the conceptual and empirical literature on indigenous cultural training for health workers within selected settler-colonial countries, together with published evaluations of such training programmes in Australia. Data extraction: Information on conceptual models underpinning training was extracted descriptively. Details of authors, year, area of investigation, participant group, evaluation method and relevant findings were extracted from published evaluations. Results of data synthesis: Six models relevant to cultural training were located and organized into a conceptual schema ('cultural competence, transcultural care, cultural safety, cultural awareness, cultural security and cultural respect'). Indigenous cultural training in Australia is most commonly based on a 'cultural awareness' model. Nine published evaluations of Australian indigenous cultural training programmes for health workers were located. Of the three studies that assessed change at multiple points in time, two found positive changes. However, the only study to include a control group found no effect. Conclusion: This review shows that the evidence for the effectiveness of indigenous cultural training programmes in Australia is poor. Critiques of cultural training from indigenous and non-indigenous scholars suggest that a 'cultural safety' model may offer the most potential to improve the effectiveness of health services for indigenous Australians. ©The Author 2011.

Previous studies have retrospectively examined the relationship of preinjury psychiatric status and postinjury PTSD with conflicting results, but no prospective studies regarding this subject have been conducted, to our knowledge. Objective: To prospectively assess the relationship of predeployment psychiatric status and injury severity with postdeployment PTSD. Design: Prospective, longitudinal study. Setting: United States military personnel deployed in support of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Participants: United States service member participants in the Millennium Cohort Study who completed a baseline questionnaire (from July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2003) and at least 1 follow-up questionnaire (from June 1, 2004, through February 14, 2006, and from May 15, 2007, through December 31, 2008) and who were deployed in the intervening period. Self-reported health information was used to prospectively examine the relationship between baseline psychiatric status and follow-up PTSD in injured and uninjured deployed individuals. Main Outcome Measures: A positive screening result using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version. Results: Of 22 630 eligible participants, 1840 (8.1%) screened positive for PTSD at follow-up, and 183 (0.8%) sustained a deployment-related physical injury that was documented in the Joint Theater Trauma Registry or the Navy-Marine Corps Combat Trauma Registry Expeditionary Medical Encounter Database.

Global habitat suitability for framework-forming cold-water corals,"Davies, A.J.; Guinotte, J.M.","Predictive habitat models are increasingly being used by conservationists, researchers and governmental bodies to identify vulnerable ecosystems and species' distributions in areas that have not been sampled. However, in the deep sea, several limitations have restricted the widespread utilisation of this approach. These range from issues with the accuracy of species presences, the lack of reliable absence data and the limited spatial resolution of environmental factors known or thought to control deep-sea species' distributions. To address these problems, global habitat suitability models have been generated for five species of framework-forming scleractinian corals by taking the best available data and using a novel approach to generate high resolution maps of seafloor conditions. High-resolution global bathymetry was used to resample gridded data from sources such as World Ocean Atlas to produce continuous 30-arc second (~1 km2) global grids for environmental, chemical and physical data of the world's oceans. The increased area and resolution of the environmental variables resulted in a greater number of coral presence records being incorporated into habitat models and higher accuracy of model predictions. The most important factors in determining cold-water coral habitat suitability were depth, temperature, aragonite saturation state and salinity. Model outputs indicated the majority of suitable coral habitat is likely to occur on the continental shelves and slopes of the Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian Oceans. The North Pacific has very little suitable scleractinian coral habitat. Numerous small scale features (i.e., seamounts), which have not been sampled or identified as having a high probability of supporting cold-water coral habitat were identified in all ocean basins. Field validation of newly identified areas is needed to determine the accuracy of model results, assess the utility of modelling efforts to identify vulnerable marine ecosystems for inclusion in future marine protected areas and reduce coral bycatch by commercial fisheries. © 2011 Davies, Guinotte.",2011,,PLoS ONE,6,4,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0018483,,#21050,Davies 2011,,
Incorporating decision flexibilities to enhance the viability of the bot project with high market risks: a case study of Taitung Deep ocean water Biotech park development project as an example,"Liou, F.-M.; Chen, B.; Fang, W.-B.","In order to authorize the private sector to develop the public-owned land or properties, the positive list of concessional projects given in the private participation related laws and regulations in Taiwan consists of those projects that are not traditionally provided or regulated by the government.

Ship patrol: Multiagent patrol under complex environmental conditions,"Agmon, N.; Urieli, D.; Stone, P.","In the problem of multiagent patrol, a team of agents is required to repeatedly visit a target area in order to monitor possible changes in state. The growing popularity of this problem comes mainly from its immediate applicability to a wide variety of domains. In this paper we concentrate on frequency-based patrol, in which the agents' goal is to optimize a frequency criterion, namely, minimizing the time between visits to a set of interest points. In situations with varying environmental conditions, the influence of changes in the conditions on the cost of travel may be immense. For example, in marine environments, the travel time of ships depends on parameters such as wind, water currents, and waves. Such environments raise the need to consider a new multiagent patrol strategy which divides the given area into regions in which more than one agent is active, for improving frequency. We prove that in general graphs this problem is intractable, therefore we focus on simplified (yet realistic) cyclic graphs with possible inner edges. Although the problem remains generally intractable in such graphs, we provide a heuristic algorithm that is shown to significantly improve point-visit frequency compared to other patrol strategies.

"Science, technology, and American diplomacy: Background and issues for congresss","Stine, D.D.","Science and engineering activities have always been international. Scientists, engineers, and health professionals frequently communicate and cooperate with one another without regard to national boundaries. This report discusses international science and technology (S&T) diplomacy, instances when American leadership in S&T is used as a diplomatic tool to enhance another country's development and to improve understanding by other nations of U.S. values and ways of doing business. According to the National Research Council, five developmental challenges where S&T could play a role include child health and child survival, safe water, agricultural research to reduce hunger and poverty, micro-economic reform, and mitigation of natural disasters. Title V of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY1979 (P.L. 95-426) provides the current legislative guidance for U.S. international S&T policy. This act states that Department of State (DOS) is the lead federal agency in developing S&T agreements. The National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-282) states that the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is to advise the President on international S&T cooperation policies and the role of S&T considerations in foreign relations. DOS sets the overall policy direction for U.S. international S&T diplomacy, and works with other federal agencies as needed. Within DOS, the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES) coordinates international S&T activities. The Science and Technology Advisor to the Secretary of State (STAS) provides S&T advice to the Secretary and the director of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). OSTP acts as a interagency liaison. A number of federal agencies that both sponsor research and use S&T in developing policy are involved in international S&T policy. A fundamental question is why the United States should invest in international S&T diplomacy instead of domestic research and development (RandD) and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education (STEM) activities, which are facing budget constraints. If Congress should decide that funding international S&T activities is important, agreeing on a policy goal beyond enhancing the country's development, such as improving U.S. relations with other countries, or enhancing popular opinion of the United States may help set priorities.Policy options identified for Congress by expert committees who have assessed U.S. international S&T diplomacy efforts include ensuring a baseline of science, engineering, and technical (SET) literacy among all appropriate DOS personnel, increasing the presence overseas of personnel with significant SET expertise, and expanding the Department's engagement within global SET networks through exchanges, assistance, and joint research activities addressing key global issues. Other proposed actions include increasing USAID support that builds S&T capacity in developing countries, and orienting other departments and agencies S&T developing country programs to support the development priorities of the host countries. Another proposal would establish a new U.S. government organization, modeled on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) known for its risk-taking and innovation, called the ""Development Applications Research Institute"" (DARI) to develop and apply innovative technologies to development problems. In all of these efforts, Congress might wish to consider enhancing the prominence of the STAS, and coordination among S&T leaders at OES, STAS, and OSTP. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

There is growing interest nationwide on the influence of environmental factors on tobacco use. AAPI communities have been found to have higher exposures to tobacco company marketing compared to the general population. The authors describe the use of Photovoice (a qualitative needs assessment technique) to empower AAPI youth to identify and understand environmental characteristics associated with tobacco use in four AAPI communities in California and Washington. Of the six major environmental themes identified from the photos, three themes were found across all four communities. Debrief sessions with youth and community leaders underscore the relevance of Photovoice for identifying community needs and motivating community organization for change. Despite some logistical challenges, Photovoice exemplifies the power and potential of this community-based methodology to capture how the environment influences youth on tobacco use. © 2011, Society for Public Health Education.

An entropy weight approach on the comprehensive evaluation of the Pearl River Delta nature reserve,"Zhang, L.; Xu, S.","Society's rapid economic development creates major challenges to the creation of nature reserves, especially in a region with high levels of ecosystem fragmentation. The reserves of the Pearl River Delta have different ecological functions and face different threats. At the same time, these nature reserves have different levels of protection and serve different purposes, such as the protection of local species and providing society with regionally protected areas. A comprehensive evaluation of nature reserves would lay a solid foundation for their management and for related policies and decision making. Three types of indicators were selected to facilitate acquiring comprehensive protection status for the nature reserves in Pearl River delta region: the size of the reserve, the level of threat from human activities, and the current level of management. An entropy method was used to make a comprehensive evaluation of the reserves. Each reserve was given a ranking from high to poor, based on a comprehensive look at all these factors. The results indicate: (1) Seven of a total 48 nature reserves studied ranked high. Thirty ranked moderately high, 10 are moderately well protected, and only one is poorly protected. In general, although some of the nature reserves were ranked high, obvious differences in their layout and design exist, especially those in the cities of Shenzhen, Zhongshan, and Foshan, where new nature reserves should be added. (2) Because the cities of Zhuhai and Huizhou have a relatively large number of nature reserves, these reserves have major differences. The design and geographic layout of nature reserves in Huizhou are relatively uniform, but in Zhuhai significant differences exist between them since some of the nature reserves are on oceanic islands. We conclude the protection level can be ranked as: Zhaoqing and Jiangmen>Shenzhen>Guangzhou and Huizhou>Foshan and Zhongshan >Zhuhai. (1) Current research in nature reserve protection focuses on determining the appropriate size for nature reserves. Governments departments administering these areas are attempting to solve this important problem. In theory, increasing the size of a nature reserve may benefit the reproduction, growth, and survival of the living creatures there, but increasing the size has a limit to its benefits, especially when human-caused pressures and management goals are considered. So the appropriate size of each area should be determined. Our research indicates the overall quality of these nature reserves is closely related to their physical size. We used a regression model to select the most suitable sizes for them. (4) Our results show an increase in the overall protection level of regional reserves is positively related to the geographic size of these areas. By constructing some high quality reserves with large geographic areas, the region can create core ecological reserves that preserve some ecological aspects of the original landscape. These reserves can also support the development of other reserves through an exchange of species and its influence on the local environment, but the size differences of these regional reserves should be small. The cooperation and coordination among nature reserves of various sizes, the level of protection each reserve provides, and species resources present should also be considered when designating a reserve. (5) The influence of natural disturbances on the comprehensive protection of reserves is larger in coastal areas or in man-made ecological islands than it is in other types of reserves.",2011,,Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica,31,18,5341-5350,,,,#21065,Zhang 2011,,
Pacific Islanders’ Perceived Risk of Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes,"Siaki, L.A.; Loescher, L.J.","Purpose: To explore literature on Pacific Islanders’ perceived risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Method: A search of literature databases for English-language perceived risk research published from 2000 to 2008. Results: Few studies targeting perceived risk of CVD (n = 6) and diabetes (n = 4) included minority participants. No studies targeted Pacific Islanders exclusively. Overall, Pacific Islanders and other minority groups inaccurately perceive their risk of these conditions. No studies explored cultural relevancy or measurement of perceived risk. Implications: Perceived risk, an integral part of health behavior change theories, is greatly understudied in Pacific Islanders. Perceived risk research for CVD and diabetes is sparse for any minority group. More research is needed to develop socioculturally appropriate interventions that promote accurate risk perceptions for both diseases and facilitate adoption of health behaviors. Ultimately, these behaviors will reduce the onset and devastating consequences of CVD and diabetes in Pacific Islanders and other minority populations. © 2011, SAGE Publications.

A free software platform for embedded real-time robotics and industrial automation,"Bruzzone, G.; Bibuli, M.; Caccia, M.","Embedded real-time platforms are a basic component of both robots and machines forthe automation of industrial processes. Although industrial applications traditionallyrely on PLC-based hardware and, in any case, proprietary software, i.e. operating systemsand development tools, in recent years dramatic improvements in hardware computerpower and free software quality made realistic the employment of architecturesbased on PC-compatible hardware and GNU/Linux software, more common in the researchcommunity. The advantages of a free infrastructure, that can become the terrainof fruitful cooperation between research institutions and companies, can be exploitedmainly in fields, in which the added value is in the application, i.e. in mechanical andalgorithmic solutions, and where the point of view is that of aware users of an infrastructure,rather than of R&amp;D competitors. This is the case of the project presented inthe following, representing a success story in which the discussion between a researchgroup and a small enterprise led to the identification of the requirements and the joineddevelopment of a common software infrastructure. When the project started in 2004,both partners, i.e. the Autonomous robotic systems and control group of CNR-ISSIAand Green Project Srl, had to substitute the obsolete platforms of their marine robotsand marking machines for casting products in steelworks with a stable software andhardware infrastructure able of transparently integrating technological improvementswhile remaining compatible with the past (backward compatibility). On the basis ofconsiderations, discussed below, about system reliability, development and maintenancecosts (including human resources), foreseen compatibility and general technicalsoundness, the choice was to verify the possibility of using standard GNU/Linux for embedded real-time applications. The result is the main technical contributionof this chapter, i.e. the practical demonstration of the possibility of using standardGNU/Linux for implementing embedded real-time control systems working up to asampling frequency of at most 2 Khz. Furthermore, four years later, the developedsystem is still demonstrating its capabilities transparently integrating technologicalimprovements and increasing more and more its performance thanks to the new realtimeproperties of the Linux kernel.A first operative release of the platform was completed in 2005 and integrated with theCNR-ISSIA Charlie unmanned surface vehicle (USV) for robotics research.A second application was the porting to the platform of the software of the control systemof Hammer, a steelwork industrial machine used for marking continuous castingproducts, developed by Greenproject s.r.l.At the moment, the platform is supporting the development of the ALANIS (AluminiumAutonomous Navigator for Intelligent Sampling) USV1 for surface and underwatercoastal monitoring. Moreover, the integration with generic field buses andimage acquisition systems is being carried out.After an introduction reporting a summary of related research in the field and a discussionof the platform requirements, the key points of the followed methodology formaking GNU/Linux real-time will be presented. Finally, two applications, a researchone and an industrial one, pointing out the basic real-time structures that the platformis required to implement, will be described. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Assessing the importance of freight transportation to U.S. agriculture,"Denicoff, M.; Jessup, E.; Taylor, A.; Nibarger, D.; Casavant, K.; Blanton, B.","A recently completed national study, conducted jointly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Washington State University considers a variety of transportation policy issues as part of a comprehensive evaluation and examination of transportation and agriculture movements. One aspect of this study concentrates on the importance of freight transportation to U.S. agriculture and is the principal focus of this paper. America's transportation system carries the food from our farms to our tables and to a hungry world. That system is based on four principal modes of transportation-trucks, trains, barges, and ocean vessels-that make up a seamless network. They cooperate and compete with one another to make a balanced and flexible system that moves our food and farm products efficiently and economically. The transportation system is more heavily used by agriculture than any other business sector; in 2007, 31 percent of all ton-miles carried were agricultural products or inputs. Many of these products are bound for export. During the past 5 years, half of the U.S. wheat crop, 36 percent of the soybean crop, and 19 percent of the corn crop moved from farms to ports for export on a seamless transportation network. The importance of transportation in making agriculture successful is noteworthy especially because of the role of agriculture in the U.S. economy. The U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) has been $13 to $14 trillion in recent years. Of this, $125 billion (1 percent) has been contributed directly by agriculture, and $540 billion (4.5 percent) by agriculture and its related industries. Looking at the U.S. balance of payments, the importance of agricultural trade is even more substantial. USDA reports that total agricultural exports averaged $82.2 billion from 2005 to 2008, reaching $115.5 billion in 2008. Agriculture's net contribution to the balance of payments that year was $36.1 billion. If any of these international-and often highly competitive-markets are lost due to inefficient transportation or failures in the supply chain, jobs are lost and farmers and ranchers receive lower prices. Inefficient or costly transportation can hurt agriculture in both international and domestic markets, and affect the balance of payments and the U.S. economy. Adequate, efficient transportation is especially critical to successful marketing of U.S. agricultural products, which depends on transportation to deliver goods. This paper reviews agriculture's use of transportation within the overall context of the entire freight transportation system, including major transportation corridors. We also examine the characteristics of agricultural supply and demand that make transportation so critical to successful marketing, and analyze the market characteristics of several agricultural commodities for transportation implications. © (2010) by the Transportation Research Forum All rights reserved.",2010,,,1,,154-172,,,,#21072,Denicoff 2010,,
Principles for integrated marine planning: A review of international experience,"Dickinson, M.; Rutherford, M.; Gunton, T.","This paper reviews and compares leading marine planning initiatives from around the world, to provide an overview of approaches and identify guiding principles for effective integrated marine planning. Based on the review, the following ten planning principles are identified: inclusive stakeholder participation, high level government leadership with clear accountability, a legal and policy framework that provides clear direction, comprehensive goals with measurable targets, effective strategies for achieving goals and targets (which in marine planning include comprehensive zoning to specify acceptable uses and activities), regular progress monitoring and evaluation, adaptive management to assess relationships between management actions and outcomes and modify plans as required, adequate scientific information, adaption of planning to take account of unique characteristics of the context, and integration of spatial, jurisdictional, and sectoral dimensions. These principles can be used to inform the design of new integrated marine planning processes in other settings, and to evaluate the performance of existing planning initiatives against international precedents.",2010,,Environments,37,3,21-46,,,,#21073,Dickinson 2010,,REVIEW ARTICLE
"Chlorhexidine-impregnated cloths to prevent skin and soft-tissue infection in marine recruits: A cluster-randomized, double-blind, controlled effectiveness trial","Whitman, T.J.; Herlihy, R.K.; Schlett, C.D.; Murray, P.R.; Grandits, G.A.; Ganesan, A.; Brown, M.; Mancuso, J.D.; Adams, W.B.; Tribble, D.R.","BACKGROUND. Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) causes skin and soft-tissue infection (SSTI) in military recruits. OBJECTIVE. To evaluate the effectiveness of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)-impregnated cloths in reducing rates of SSTI and S. aureus colonization among military recruits. DESIGN. A cluster-randomized (by platoon), double-blind, controlled effectiveness trial. SETTING. Marine Officer Candidate School, Quantico, Virginia, 2007. PARTICIPANTS. Military recruits. INTERVENTION. Application of CHG-impregnated or control (Comfort Bath; Sage) cloths applied over entire body thrice weekly. MEASUREMENTS. Recruits were monitored daily for SSTI. Baseline and serial nasal and/or axillary swabs were collected to assess S. aureus colonization. RESULTS. Of 1,562 subjects enrolled, 781 (from 23 platoons) underwent CHG-impregnated cloth application and 781 (from 21 platoons) underwent control cloth application. The rate of compliance (defined as application of 50% or more of wipes) at 2 weeks was similar (CHG group, 63%; control group, 67%) and decreased over the 6-week period. The mean 6-week SSTI rate in the CHG-impregnated cloth group was 0.094, compared with 0.071 in the control group (analysis of variance model rate difference, 0.025 ± 0.016; P=.14). At baseline, 43% of subjects were colonized with methicillin- susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), and 2.1% were colonized with MRSA. The mean incidence of colonization with MSSA was 50% and 61% (P=.026) and with MRSA was 2.6% and 6.0% (P=.034) for the CHG-impregnated and control cloth groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. CHG-impregnated cloths applied thrice weekly did not reduce rates of SSTI among recruits. S. aureus colonization rates increased in both groups but to a lesser extent in those assigned to the CHG-impregnated cloth intervention. Antecedent S. aureus colonization was not a risk factor for SSTI. Additional studies are needed to identify effective measures for preventing SSTI among military recruits.

Does trauma risk management reduce psychological distress in deployed troops?,"Frappell-Cooke, W.; Gulina, M.; Green, K.; Hacker Hughes, J.; Greenberg, N.","Background: Military personnel exposed to potentially traumatic events whilst deployed on operational duties may develop psychological problems. The Royal Marines have made extensive use of Trauma Risk Management (TRiM), a peer-support system that operates through practitioners embedded within operational units. TRiM aims to promote recognition of psychological illness and to facilitate social support. Aims: To evaluate the effects of TRiM in two units at different stages of implementation. Methods: Royal Marines and Army personnel were surveyed prior to, during and upon return from an operational deployment to Afghanistan. Participants completed measures of general mental health (GHQ12) and traumatic stress [PCL(C)]. Results: We received responses from 180 pre-deployment, 105 during deployment and 137 post-deployment. Personnel within units with experience of TRiM reported lower levels of psychological distress than personnel in the unit who were using TRiM for the first time. Both groups reported higher psychological distress scores before and during deployment, compared with post-deployment. However, we found personnel who reported having more access to social support during deployment reported less psychological distress. Conclusions: The use of TRiM may assist in increasing the psychological resilience of military personnel through the facilitation of social support; this may have particular utility during operational deployments. © The Author 2010.

A companion modeling approach applied to fishery management,"Worrapimphong, K.; Gajaseni, N.; Le Page, C.; Bousquet, F.","Don Hoi Lord, a coastal wetland in the upper gulf of Thailand, is famous for the razor clam (Solen regularis), which is a source of food and income for local fishermen. However, the razor clam population is significantly decreasing so the aim of this study was to analyze the razor clam fishery and develop a management plan engaging the different stakeholders in collective discussions. A participatory modelling approach was used, including (a) agent-based modelling (ABM) and (b) role-playing games (RPG). First, an individual-state distribution model of the razor clam population was designed and calibrated to synthesise knowledge. Two RPG sessions supported by this biological model were organised to initiate collective learning and promote discussion among stakeholders. After playing with the baseline scenario showing the actual harvesting situation, discussions led to the definition of alternative scenarios for clam management such as establishment and rotation of zones closed for harvesting, and quota systems. These scenarios developed during the RPG sessions were more deeply investigated with an agent-based model that included fishermen agents and the individual-state distribution model of the razor clam population. Simulations of different scenarios (reserve, quota and combination of reserve and quota) were produced to enable better informed discussion between different stakeholders. Stakeholders have acknowledged that management through rotating reserves is not efficient if the duration of reserves is too short. They have realised that the efficiency of reserves is hard to assess without better data on clam recruitment. They have also explored another management option which is the quota system. In the final stage, the local participatory process was endorsed by the incumbent regional policy-making actor. Unfortunately, because of rapid administrative rotation the project abruptly lost support. This unexpected event emphasises the need for continuous monitoring of all actors entering and/or leaving the system, which can radically change the interactions among them and, therefore, the whole management context. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2010,,Environmental Modelling and Software,25,11,1334-1344,,10.1016/j.envsoft.2010.03.012,,#21079,Worrapimphong 2010,,
Impacts of marine protected areas on fishing communities,"Mascia, M.B.; Claus, C.A.; Naidoo, R.","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a popular conservation strategy, but their impacts on human welfare are poorly understood. To inform future research and policy decisions, we reviewed the scientific literature to assess MPA impacts on five indicators of human welfare: food security, resource rights, employment, community organization, and income. Following MPA establishment, food security generally remained stable or increased in older and smaller MPAs. The ability of most fishing groups to govern MPA resources changed. Increased resource rights were positively correlated with MPA zoning and compliance with MPA regulations. Small sample sizes precluded statistical tests of the impacts of MPAs on employment, community organization, and income. Our results demonstrate that MPAs shape the social well-being and political power of fishing communities; impacts (positive and negative) vary within and among social groups; and social impacts are correlated with some-but not all-commonly hypothesized explanatory factors. Accordingly, MPAs may represent a viable strategy for enhancing food security and empowering local communities, but current practices negatively affect at least a minority of fishers. To inform policy making, further research must better document and explain variation in the positive and negative social impacts of MPAs. © 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.",2010,,Conservation Biology,24,5,1424-1429,,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01523.x,,#21082,Mascia 2010,,
"Fatty fish, marine-3 fatty acids and incidence of heart failure","Levitan, E.B.; Wolk, A.; Mittleman, M.A.","Background/Objectives: Marine-3 fatty acids have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors. Consumption of fatty fish and marine-3 has been associated with lower rates of cardiovascular diseases. We examined the association of fatty fish and marine-3 with heart failure (HF) in a population of middle-aged and older women. Subjects/Methods: Participants in the Swedish Mammography Cohort aged 48-83 years completed 96-item food-frequency questionnaires. Women without any history of HF, myocardial infarction or diabetes at baseline (n=36 234) were followed from 1 January 1998 until 31 December 2006 for HF hospitalization or mortality through Swedish inpatient and cause-of-death registers; 651 women experienced HF events. Cox proportional hazards models accounting for age and other confounders were used to calculate incidence rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Compared with women who did not eat fatty fish, RR were 0.86 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.10) for <1 serving per week, 0.80 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.01) for 1 serving per week, 0.70 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.94) for 2 servings per week and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.40) for ≥3 servings per week (P trend=0.049).

Protective effects of xyloketal B against MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans and PC12 cells,"Lu, X.-l.; Yao, X.-l.; Liu, Z.; Zhang, H.; Li, W.; Li, Z.; Wang, G.-L.; Pang, J.; Lin, Y.; Xu, Z.; Chen, L.; Pei, Z.; Zeng, J.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 2% of the population over age 65 years. Mitochondrial defect and oxidative stress actively participate in the dopaminergic (DA) neuron degeneration in PD. Xyloketal B is a novel marine compound with unique chemical structure isolated from mangrove fungus Xylaria sp. (no. 2508). Recently, we have demonstrated that Xyloketal B can directly scavenge DPPH free radicals and protects mitochondria against oxidative insult. In the present study, we investigate the neuroprotective action of xyloketal B against MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans and PC12 cells. The viability and DA neurodegeneration was assessed in C. elegans selectively expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in DA neurons. PC12 cell damage was measured using MTT and nuclear morphology. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential and total GSH were assessed. Xyloketal B dose-dependently protected against MPP+-induced loss of viability and DA neurodegeneration in C. elegans. Similar neuroprotection was replicated in MPP+ PC12 cell model. In addition, xyloketal B attenuated MPP+-induced intracellular ROS accumulation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and restored total GSH level in PC12 cells. All together, the present study demonstrates that xyloketal B protects against MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in C. elegans and PC12 cells mainly through its antioxidant property and restoration of total GSH level. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Rare and colonial breeding birds in the Netherlands in 2006-2007 ,"Van Dijk, A.; Hustings, F.; Boele, A.; Koffijberg, K.; Zoetebier, D.; Plate, C.","National censuses of colonial and rare breeding birds in The Netherlands have been carried out from 1992 onwards (and earlier for some species). The project focuses on 17 colonial breeding birds and about 80 rare breeders (Table 1) and is part of a governmental ecological monitoring scheme. National co-ordination is carried out by SOVON Dutch Centre for Field Ornithology, in close cooperation with Statistics Netherlands (trend analyses). In the Wadden Sea the counts are part of the trilateral TMAP monitoring program. For some species the data are mainly derived from (annual) species-specific surveys, e.g. White Stork Ciconia ciconia, Eurasian Spoonbill Platalea leucorodia, Montagu's Harrier Circus pygargus, Peregrine Falcon Falco pelegrinus, Corn Crake Crex crex. Little Owl Athene noctua, Barn Owl Tyto alba, European Nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus (2007 only) and Red-backed Shrike Lantus collurio. Other rare breeding birds are surveyed annually at least in the core breeding areas, including all Natura 2000 sites. Colonial breeding birds are usually covered fully. Fieldwork is highly standardised and mostly carried out by dedicated amateur birdwachters and staff of nature reserves. Trend analyses are carried out with TRIM and baseline results are published in annual reports and on www.sovon.nl. This paper summarises the results for 2006 and 2007. Numbers, estimates, details of coverage and an assessment of trends are listed in Table 1. Highlights among rare breeding birds in 2006-2007 included records of Cattle Egret Bubulcus ibis (2006, second ever), Whooper Swan Cygnus cygnus (2006-07, first breeding 2005), White-tailed Eagle Halieetus albicilla (2006-07, first records, both years one young fledged, Oostvaardersplassen), Common Crane Grus grus (three pairs of which two successful, Drenthe), Black-legged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla (40 pairs in 2006 on three offshore platforms in the North Sea), White-winged Tern Chlidonias leucopterus (first breeding of four pure pairs in 2007, following an influx in May), European Bee-eater Merops apiaster (1-3 pairs) and Paddyfield Warbler Acrocephalus agricola (2007 successful pair on Vlieland, first breeding record). Previous increases in Little Egret Egretta garzetta, Eurasian Spoonbill, Peregrine Falcon, Mediterranean Gull Larus melanocephalus, European Nightjar, Common Kingfisher Alcedo atthis, Middle-spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos medius, Grey Wagtail Motacilla cinerea, Cetti's Warbler Cettia cetti and Zitting Cisticola Cisticola juncidis continued in 2006-07. Also many goose species thrived, but total population sizes were not assessed in these species. Corn Crake experienced a peak year in 2007 after three years of low abundance in 2004-2006. Little Tern Sternula albifrons reached highest numbers in the past decades. Barn Owl had its best breeding year in nearly 50 years (3300 pairs in 2007), with lots of second clutches and high success. Previously expanding Great White Egrets Casmeriodius albus experienced a sharp decline in their core breeding area in the Oostvaardersplassen (143 pairs in 2006, 43 in 2007) due to drought in the breeding colony. Species with continuing long term declines include Hen Harrier Circus cyaneus (41 pairs remaining on Wadden Sea islands in 2007), Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix (one site with 15-23 males, re-introduction at second site in 2007/08), Kentish Plover Charadrius alexandrinus, Ruff Philomachus pugnax (nearly extinct), Black-headed Gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus (decline now spreading to Wadden Sea), Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus (all-time low), Eurasian Wryneck Jynx torquilla (a few tens at most), Crested Lark Galerida cristata (all-time low), Tawny Pipit Anthus campestris (one territory in 2007, probably not breeding), Northern Wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe, Fieldfare Turdus pilaris, Great Reed Warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus (2006 lowest number since 1990) and Penduline Tit Remiz pendulinus. Great Grey Shrike Lanius excubitor and Ortolan Bunting Emberiza hortulana must be considered extinct. Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra balances on the verge of extinction. Pied Avocet Recurvirostra avosetta stabilised, but its population has declined with 31% since 2000.

The tower of Babel: Different perceptions and controversies on change and status of North Sea fish stocks in multi-stakeholder settings,"Verweij, M.C.; van Densen, W.L.T.; Mol, A.J.P.","Fishermen, scientists, national policy makers, and staff of environmental NGOs (ENGOs) hold different perceptions about temporal patterns in fish stocks. Perception differences are problematic in multi-stakeholder settings, because they elicit controversies and unbalanced disputes. These hinder effective participation, a prerequisite for 'good governance' and effective management of sustainable fisheries. This study shows that perceptions of change ('does the stock increase or decrease?') and of current status of a fish stock ('is it doing well or not?') are influenced by the capturing and processing of information, rather than by interests alone. We focused on the Dutch North Sea fishery on plaice and sole and examined (1) availability and accessibility of information on temporal patterns of these stocks and (2) perception differences between all parties. A first explanation for these differences is the use of different parameters as a measure for stock size. Fishermen focus on catch rates or catch-per-unit-effort (relative stock size), whereas scientists, policy makers, and ENGO-staff mainly use scientific assessments of spawning stock biomass (absolute stock size). Between-group perception differences are further explained by spatial aggregation levels of information, lengths of time series evaluated, and by modes of comparison to qualify the current status of fish stocks. Awareness of information differences and the development of shared information use and processing may release some of the tensions in multi-stakeholder settings debating fisheries management. However, comprehension problems amongst all parties on how spawning stock biomass is reconstructed and how it relates to catch rates in the fishery may pose an enduring barrier. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Multivariate modelling was used to calculate risk indicators for poor self-reported oral health.Results: REALD-30 scores were lower among those who believed teeth should be infrequently brushed, believed cordial was good for teeth, did not own a toothbrush or owned a toothbrush but brushed irregularly. Tooth removal risk indicators included being older, problem-based dental attendance and believing cordial was good for teeth. Poor self-rated oral health risk indicators included being older, healthcare card ownership, difficulty paying dental bills, problem-based dental attendance, believing teeth should be brushed infrequently and irregular brushing. Perceived need for dental care risk indicators included being female and problem-based dental attendance. Perceived gum disease risk indicators included being older and irregular brushing. Feeling uncomfortable about oro-facial appearance risk indicators included problem-based dental attendance and irregular brushing. Food avoidance risk indicators were being female, difficulty paying dental bills, problem-based dental attendance and irregular brushing. Poor oral health-related quality of life risk indicators included difficulty paying dental bills and problem-based dental attendance.Conclusions: REALD-30 was significantly associated with oral health literacy-related outcomes. Oral health literacy-related outcomes were risk indicators for each of the poor self-reported oral health domains among this marginalised population. © 2010 Parker and Jamieson; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2010,,BMC Oral Health,10,1,,,10.1186/1472-6831-10-3,,#21093,Parker 2010,,
Endangerment survey of construction activities on shore line,"Torkianfar, F.; Jafari, H.R.; Sadeghpour, A.","In view of the comprehensive governmental policies on the grounds of exploitation developments from the South Pars Gas Field, on one hand and the impacts of the plan implementation on the environment on the other hand, the performance of impact assessments and consequences arising from regional building operations, taking into consideration the coastal strip is the principle objective of this research. In addition to which, the survey of abiding to environmental criteria, the rendering of modes to decrement and prevent the adverse impacts of activities, the preparation of monitoring environmental programs and establishing compatibility between regional activities and the environment, is another aim of this research. The distinguished economic region of Pars Energy in southwestern Iran encompasses 10,000 hectares of land, was established in the year 1998. The South Pars Gas Field consists of 6.8 percent of the total global gas reserves and more than 38 percent of the entire gas reserves of the Country. It is one of the largest resources of the Country's energy, located on the common frontier of Iran and Qatar and is accounted for being, one of the major energy resources, of the Country. The minimum elevation at sea level is zero at the coast and its maximum altitude is approximately 1,400 meters, in the northern heights of the region. The region is situated in the coastal drainage basin and the only regional surface water, is the Gavbandi River. Similarly, the general direction of groundwater flow is towards the sea and its surface level is high. The only active fault present in the region is the Gavbandi Fault, which is situated at a distance of less than 5 kilometers, northeast of the Naieband National Park. In this phase of the research, with the aid of geological maps and types of rocks, in accordance with reference to the Special National Strategy Plan, seismic diagrams and land slides (drifts), in three appropriate zones of durability, semi-suitable and unsuitable have been prepared. In concern with the ground cover conditions, the regional plants are of the Polygonaceae, Leguminesae and the palmaceae families, including a few classifications of weeds and scrubs, small trees, ornamental and fruit bearing trees. Likewise, in the area of study, the bird community is of an acceptable diversity. The presence of several terrestrial and aquatic habitats has lead to a high diversity of birds in the region in having environmental potentials in the area. In the South Pars region, the Naieband National Marine Park and two creeks which are known as Basatin and Bidkhoon are vital environmental banks and suitable locations for spawning and the breeding of aqua life. The proximity with oil and gas installations in the Asalooyeh region can be precarious in two ways. One, in an indirect mode, due to development activities that take place in the area, such as, constructions and littoral structures etc., and in a direct form, due to the perpetual and probable leakage of oil, gas and their derivatives into the regional waters, is possible. According to the census in the year 1996, the township of Kangan had a population of 78,318 persons and with due attention to the economic structure and migration, the area is confronted with a rise in population on the whole. In order to assess and survey the consequences, arising from the South Pars constructional activities on the coastline, as well as the appraisal of the relative potentials and the vulnerability of the various sections, of the implementation location of the project, from a list to recognize occurrences and the matrix, so as to determine and gain an absolute reliability as to the results, two other methods have been utilized. In this study, with the help of determining the slope, soil conditions (from the viewpoint of depth), bed rock (from the viewpoint of durability), ground cover (from the point of view of density), sensitive ecosystems (creeks, the Naieband Gulf and Naieband National Park) and by taking into consideration the specifications and conditions of the limits, proportionate ecological, industrial and residential model surveys of constructions have been prepared in these three aspects and they have been utilized in zoning. After executing the zoning, so as to evaluate and specify the amount of damages caused, due to the various activities, the checklist method was resorted to. The utilization of this method took place in the two phases of construction and exploitation, in 6 of the major or principle regional activities such as, the refinery, petrochemicals, airport, port and docks, gas transition line and transportation. In the checklist used with respect to each of the activities, only the negative consequences as to the exploitation impacts of the environmental factors have been distinguished. These consequences, from the point of view of being a collection of impacts, retrievable and likewise, its impacts on the coastline were surveyed and then the results gained were totalized. In continuation, so as to analyze and appraise the regional environmental impacts and consequences and with due attention to the results of the list, (estimations of the initial impacts), for the recognition of the intensity and importance of the impacts, as well as totalizing the quantitative facets of the impacts and a final decision-making, the impacts predicted in the list method, is in the form of a matrix, in two macro and micro proportions, in which they have been categorized and totalized. With due attention to the results obtained from assessing the capacity, the ecological limits were divided into three zones, the first zone is of 200 hectares, the second zone is of 19,200 hectares and the unsuitable zone, is allocated to 26,300 hectares. In comparing the ecological capacity role of the area, with the special regional development role, illustrates that, approximately 56 percent of the development is in the semi-suitable zone, and 44 percent of the development shall be conducted in the unsuitable zone. With due attention to the fact that since that the development in the region under study, shall be executed in the unsuitable environmental bed, though, due to the vast importance and aptness of the region, in continuance with more accurate surveys of the limits under study with the aid of other methods in connection with the project implementation was taken into discussion. The results of the checklist show that from between the 6 main activities present in the South Pars Development Plan Region, the refinery and petrochemicals, followed by the gas transfer pipelines, has the highest percentage of adverse impacts on the environment. Similarly, the results of the implementation matrixes of the project in the region do not qualify. Due to the outstanding economic benefits of the South Pars region and the joint participation issue, as well as the exploitation of this resource by the southern neighbors of Iran, a termination of the plan activities is not feasible. Therefore, in the continuation of this research, modes to decrease the impacts and environmental monitoring under influence, with due attention to the regional conditions have been rendered. After surveying the impacts of the mentioned plan, on the various environmental components, as well as with emphasis on pollution and environmental destruction as an adverse impact of the project on the environment, the manner to decrement the negative impacts of the project in the region has been given in brief, as follows: Means to reduce the adverse impacts of the project on the physical environment: Conservation and restoration of the regional lands, reducing the impacts arising from the occurrence of inundation in the region, abiding to the 60 meter perimeter from the coast, for several constructional activities in the area, preparing the required equipments for the collection of coastal sand, polluted with oil products, the utilization of suitable chemical compounds for purging oil pollution in the region Manner to decrease the oil impacts on the biological environment: Utilizing recycled water and surface runoffs, utilizing brackish or fresh water resources, Use of irrigation systems prone to slighter consumption, prevention of industrial development in the direction of the Naieband National Park, prevention of the discharge of untreated urban, industrial and agricultural sewage and wastewaters into the sea, abiding to the standards and controlling the temperature of sewage released into the marine water (sea), controlling the leakage from oil pipes and installations, including the particular oil tankers utilized for the replacement of oil produce Method to reduce the adverse impacts on the socio-economic and cultural environment: Performing population scanning studies, executing special tutorial programs, so as to establish coordination between the indigenous populace, abiding in rendering priority to indigenous individuals, in relative to employing manpower Modes to decrement the environmental pollution impacts: Accurate designing of chimneys utilized for pollutants, utilization of filters to decrease pollution in the flares of industrial chimneys, Siting the approved or correct industrial development, with due attention to the direction of wind in the region, sanitary burial of wastes, controlling the infiltration of pollutants into the surface waters and the utilization of sensing equipment, in regards the leakage of pipes. The monitoring program taking into consideration the South Pars region comprises of: Survey of the quality of water resources by sampling and testing the specifications under view, topographical and landform monitoring, in order to control and regulate development procedures, measuring and monitoring sound level.

Association of marine omega-3 fatty acid levels with telomeric aging in patients with coronary heart disease,"Farzaneh-Far, R.; Lin, J.; Epel, E.S.; Harris, W.S.; Blackburn, E.H.; Whooley, M.A.","Context: Increased dietary intake of marine omega-3 fatty acids is associated with prolonged survival in patients with coronary heart disease. However, the mechanisms underlying this protective effect are poorly understood. Objective: To investigate the association of omega-3 fatty acid blood levels with temporal changes in telomere length, an emerging marker of biological age. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort study of 608 ambulatory outpatients in California with stable coronary artery disease recruited from the Heart and Soul Study between September 2000 and December 2002 and followed up to January 2009 (median, 6.0 years; range, 5.0-8.1 years). Main Outcome Measures: We measured leukocyte telomere length at baseline and again after 5 years of follow-up. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to investigate the association of baseline levels of omega-3 fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] and eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]) with subsequent change in telomere length. Results: Individuals in the lowest quartile of DHA+EPA experienced the fastest rate of telomere shortening (0.13 telomere-to-single-copy gene ratio [T/S] units over 5 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.17), whereas those in the highest quartile experienced the slowest rate of telomere shortening (0.05 T/S units over 5 years; 95% CI, 0.02-0.08; P&lt;.001 for linear trend across quartiles). Levels of DHA+EPA were associated with less telomere shortening before (unadjusted β coefficient × 10-3=0.06; 95% CI, 0.02-0.10) and after (adjusted β coefficient × 10-3=0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.08) sequential adjustment for established risk factors and potential confounders. Each 1-SD increase in DHA+EPA levels was associated with a 32% reduction in the odds of telomere shortening (adjusted odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47-0.98). Conclusion: Among this cohort of patients with coronary artery disease, there was an inverse relationship between baseline blood levels of marine omega-3 fatty acids and the rate of telomere shortening over 5 years. ©2010 American Medical Association.

Wind turbine performance assessment and knowledge management for aerodynamic behaviour modelling and design: IEA experience,"Maeda, T.; Schepers, G.","During the 1990s, several institutes cooperated within the International Energy Agency (IEA) Annexes XIV and XVIII in order to perform aerodynamic experimental programmes on full-scale horizontal axis wind turbines in field conditions. In these experimental programmes, local aerodynamic quantities (forces, velocities) are measured at several locations along a rotor blade. As a result of the international collaboration within the IEA Annex XIV, it has been possible to coordinate data processing and to create a database of measured data. The detailed aerodynamic measurements obtained on very different turbines gave a unique opportunity to better understand the aerodynamic behaviour of a wind turbine and resulted in the development and validation of more accurate aerodynamic models. Moreover, the extreme wind in the Pacific Ocean region in Asia damages wind turbines every year. To promote the installation of wind turbines in such a severe wind region, the Extreme Wind Speed Database was constructed by Japanese New Energy and the Industrial Technology Development Organization. The database includes the extreme wind speed distribution in Japan for users who want to examine more detailed information on, for example, the local terrain effects. © 2011 Woodhead Publishing Limited.

Is success in weight loss treatment contagious (do attendance and outcomes cluster within treatment groups)?,"Simon, G.E.; Rohde, P.; Ludman, E.J.; Jeffery, R.W.; Linde, J.A.; Operskalski, B.H.; Arterburn, D.; Finch, E.A.","Data from a trial of a 26-session structured group behavioral weight loss intervention were used to examine how group attendance, weight loss, and changes in depression clustered within therapy groups. Participants were recruited via a population-based survey of female health plan members aged 40-65. The sample included 143 women attending 13 therapy groups. Average number of sessions attended was 15.9 (S.D. 7.2) and average weight loss over 12 months was 4.24 kg (S.D. 7.79 kg). In hierarchical (random effects) linear models predicting attendance and weight loss, attendance did cluster significantly within therapy groups (F= 2.83, df= 12, p= .002; ICC=.14) but weight loss (F= 0.89, df=12, p= .56; ICC= .00) and change in depressive symptoms (F= 0.25, df= 12, p= .99; ICC=.00) did not. Accounting for baseline characteristics of group participants had no significant effect on these findings. Relatively small average weight loss in this sample may have limited our ability to detect clustering of weight loss within groups. We conclude that clinicians should consider addressing the effects of drop-out on other group members and that researchers should consider the impact of clustering in analyses of data regarding group treatments. © 2010 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.

"On the relationship between squid and the environment: Artisanal jigging for Loligo plei at São Sebastião Island (24°S), southeastern Brazil","Postuma, F.A.; Gasalla, M.A.","The squid Loligo plei concentrates in the southeastern Brazil Bight, where it has traditionally supported small-scale fisheries around São Sebastião Island (SSI). Sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a (Chl a), windspeed, wave height, rainfall, and lunar phase are related to fishing records and to the results of a survey of local fishers to investigate how they believe environmental variables might affect catches of L. plei. Daily fishery-dependent data over the years 2005-2009 were obtained from a fishing cooperative and were matched with satellite and meteorological forecast data. Generalized linear models were used to explore the significance of environmental variables in relation to variability in catch and catch per unit effort (cpue). Squid are fished with jigs in water shallower than 20 m, generally where SST is warmer and Chl a and windspeed are lower. Cpue and monthly catches decreased from 2005 to 2008, followed by a slight increase in 2009. The correlations between fishery and environmental data relate well to fishers' oceanological knowledge, underscoring the potential of incorporating such knowledge into evaluations of the fishery. © 2010 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The selected indicators are presented, how they are calculated is explained, and the philosophy behind the comparative approach is given. The combination of selected indicators is intended to reflect different dynamics, tracking processes that display differential responses to fishing, and is meant to provide a complementary means of assessing marine ecosystem trends and states. IndiSeas relied on inputs and insights provided by the local experts from participating ecosystems, helping to understand state and trend indicators and to disentangle the effect of other potential ecosystem drivers, such as climate variability. This project showed that the use of simple and available indicators under an ecosystem approach can achieve a real, wide-reaching evaluation of marine ecosystem status caused by fishing. This is important because the socio-economics of areas where fishing activities develop differs significantly around the globe, and in many countries, insufficient data are available for complex and exhaustive analyses. © 2010 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

On the SAR derived alert in the detection of oil spills according to the analysis of the EGEMP,"Ferraro, G.; Baschek, B.; de Montpellier, G.; Njoten, O.; Perkovic, M.; Vespe, M.","Satellite services that deliver information about possible oil spills at sea currently use different labels of ""confidence"" to describe the detections based on radar image processing.

There is an ongoing discussion on the suitability of the existing classification systems of possible oil spills detected by radar satellite images with regard to the relevant significance and correspondence to user requirements. This paper contains a basic analysis of user requirements, current technical possibilities of satellite services as well as proposals for a redesign of the classification system as an evolution towards a more structured alert system.

"Ruptures, rights, and repair: The political economy of trauma in Haiti","James, E.C.","This article analyzes the unintended consequences of humanitarian and development interventions in Haiti implemented to facilitate its postconflict transition following the period of military rule between 1991 and 1994. International and national governmental and nongovernmental initiatives to provide redress and healing to victims of human rights abuses from this period inadvertently contributed to the growth of a political economy of trauma. I argue that state-sponsored and non-state interventions aimed at truth seeking, acknowledging past ruptures, and reparations have intersected with the politics of local communities in ways that contribute to the commoditization of suffering in the political economy of trauma. The experience of a woman whose bodily integrity and personal sovereignty were violated by members of Haiti's terror apparatus demonstrates the presence of a terror economy. My witnessing of her interactions with the international and national humanitarian and development aid organizations that assisted her in the aftermath of violation revealed the contours of the compassion economy. It is the compassion economy that is the particular focus of this article. I evaluate whether rendering visible or audible the individual and collective suffering of the past truly aid processes of social reconstruction, democratization, and peace building, especially in states plagued with ongoing social, political, and economic insecurity. I argue that the forms of citizenship that these interventions engender are rarely permanent, especially in fragile or failed states, and may exacerbate the societal cleavages that gave rise to conflict. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Community involvement in fisheries management: Experiences in the Gulf of Thailand countries,"Nasuchon, N.; Charles, A.","This paper examines the involvement of coastal communities in fisheries management among the countries of the Gulf of Thailand-Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. Initiatives to decentralize management to local governing bodies, to utilize traditional management methods and to engage in community agreements to protect local resources are explored. An examination of recent experiences indicates some movement toward more local involvement in management. However, the study also leads to several suggestions for the future: in Vietnam and Cambodia, there is a need for significant legislation to control fisheries operations and greater clarity of the role of communities in management; in Malaysia, there is an overall need for more support to local fisheries management; and in Thailand, the need is for greater support of local-level enforcement and monitoring activities. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Storage of hydrocarbons in salt caverns - Strategic significance and the use of salt brine as a medium for improvement of environment ,"Pieńkowski, G.","Storage of strategic hydrocarbon resources (petroleum, fuel and natural gas resources) in subsurface repositories (geologic structures) is a strategic necessity in countries largely dependent on oil and gas supply from abroad. Benefits of creating strategic petroleum reserves (SPRs) and natural gas storage facilities for these countries are obvious: SPRs are a first line of defense against interruption in critical oil and natural gas supplies, and they provide economic security and increase regional stability. Easily accessible sites located near the nodes of existing pipelines, main industrial centers and NATO bases should be targeted for safe storage of liquid fuels, crude oil or gas. With little national storage capacity, Poland has been near extremis a few times due to interruptions in the flow of crude oil and natural gas. It is in the Polish national interest for the country to establish a Strategic Petroleum Reserve for liquid fuels and natural gas reserves, which would provide a cushion against the negative impacts of a hydrocarbon shortage on its economy and national security. The same problem concerns most of the new NATO member countries in Central and Eastern Europe (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Hungary). These countries are potential beneficiaries of this project. Among them, only Poland is blessed with abundant geologic salt structures, i.e. thick bedded salts and salt domes. Therefore, Poland can provide storage capacity also for the NATO allies (and other EU members). The Department's agent in this effort is the Polish Geological Institute (PGI), performing duties of the Polish Geological Survey. PGI established cooperation with the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in the United States and the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO). The project was accepted and implemented as a short-term project in April 2005 (NATO-CCMS project EAP.CMS-PS 982185). The purpose of this project was to evaluate the feasibility of using subsurface salt deposit repositories for strategic oil, liquid fuel and gas storage, and for using generated brines to improve the ecological and environmental conditions of the Baltic Sea. The last expansion of NATO involves the necessity of developing new military bases, including the need for safe storage of logistic fuels. Occurrence of salt domes nearby most of the planned bases in Poland provides an excellent place for safe (both from the military and environmental point of view) storage of fuels. Only dry salt caverns (without use of salt brine, operated by pressurized nitrogen) will be applied for logistic fuel storage. Previous experimental studies had shown that some logistic fuels (including jet fuels) stored in salt caverns for five years did not change significantly as far as concerns their chemical and physical properties and they were still fully usable after five years of such storage. Construction of fuel repositories for NA TO bases in salt domes also provides an environmental advantage. The traditional approach (adopted for example in the existing NATO ""Minimum Military Requirement"" and Capability Package - CP 22) uses steel tanks. However, surface steel tanks are exposed to natural weather hazards and potential terrorist attack - not mentioning their vulnerability to warfare attacks. Steel tanks hidden at a shallow depth (up to some 20 m) in the ground are much more expensive, although somewhat safer-the threats mentioned above are reduced. However, underground storage of fuel poses another threat - leakage of toxic fuel might be hazardous to groundwater supplies. Construction inexpensive repositories at a depth of several hundred meters, in naturally isolated rock salt, make them safe concerning any contamination of the environment and other threats. Above all, such repositories meet strategic requirements - they are practically immune to any warfare attack. Five salt domes in central Poland were indicated as the most suitable sites for logistic fuel repositories and preliminary geological assessment was prepared. In the future this project should gain more interest because of security issues and may warrant further investigation for Poland as well as other NA TO countries. Construction of repositories in salt provides a substantial cost advantage (underground salt repositories are about 85% - 800 % less costly than traditional surface steel tanks). Moreover, storage of hydrocarbons in geologic structures is much safer from a strategic and ecological point of view. Most of the salt deposits considered for an SPR in Poland were formed in the Late Permian epoch. The proposed full scale project also addresses potential ecological problems connected with the by-product from leaching large salt caverns. Construction of large strategic petroleum repositories can produce tens of million of tons of salt brine. As the big petroleum repositories will likely be built at the Baltic Sea coast, this project involves a new paradigm concerning treatment and disposal of the excess salt brine. The salt brine can be used as an agent for re-cultivation of the Baltic sea-bottom where anoxic conditions prevail. Due to the influx of anthropogenic contaminants (industrial discharges, phosphate and nitrogen communal and agricultural pollutants, etc.), the periodic, natural influx of heavier and well-oxygenated waters from the North Sea can no longer cope with the negative effects of resulting eutrophication. This is by far the most severe ecological problem in the entire Baltic Sea region. It is proposed that diluted and oxygenated, but somewhat heavier than sea water salt brine be pumped through a pipeline directly to the deeper parts of the Baltic Sea. The enhanced (oxygenated) salt brine could serve to re-establish the life and improve the ecological environment in the Baltic Sea bottom, a positive environmental impact. This project may contribute to fulfillment of at least four of the general objectives of NATO-SPS projects - it reduces to a minimum the negative environmental impact of both civil and military repositories, it conducts regional studies including cross-border activities (particularly in the field of Baltic Sea protection), by building new repositories it can serve to prevent possible crises related to scarcity of energy resources from interruption of oil or gas supplies, and it addresses emerging risks to the environment by using salt brine as an agent contributing to biological recovery of the Baltic Sea.",2009,,Przeglad Geologiczny,57,9,791-797,,,,#21117,Pieńkowski 2009,,
Smoker interest in lower harm alternatives to cigarettes: National survey data,"Wilson, N.; Borland, R.; Weerasekera, D.; Edwards, R.; Russell, M.","Introduction: The aim of this study was to examine knowledge and attitudes to lower harm alternatives to cigarettes among New Zealand (NZ) smokers. Methods: The NZ arm of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Survey (ITC Project) utilizes the NZ Health Survey (a national sample). From this sample, we surveyed adult smokers (N = 1,376). Results: Knowledge about smokeless tobacco was poor, with only 16% regarding such products as less harmful than ordinary cigarettes. Only 7% considered such products to be ""a lot less"" harmful. When participants were asked to assume that these products were much less harmful than cigarettes, 34% of smokers stated that they would be interested in trying smokeless tobacco products, with another 11% saying ""maybe"" or ""don't know."" In the multivariate analysis, Maori smokers were significantly more interested in trying smokeless products than Europeans in all 3 models considered (e.g., Model 1: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.23-2.37). There was also significantly increased interest for those concerned about the impact of smoking on health and quality of life in the future (AOR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.17-1.78). But interest did not vary significantly by 2 measures of socioeconomic status and varied inconsistently by 2 measures of financial stress. Discussion: The finding that one third of smokers said that they would be interested in trying smokeless products suggests that these products could have a role as part of a tobacco epidemic endgame that phases out smoked tobacco. Differences in interest level by ethnic group may be relevant to stimulating further work in this area (e.g., among those health workers concerned for smokers with the highest need to quit). © The Author 2009.

Conclusions: Infections are common in patients in contemporary ICUs, and risk of infection increases with duration of ICU stay. In this large cohort, infection was independently associated with an increased risk of hospital death. ©2009 American Medical Association.

Environmentally critical issues & options in seismic acquisition for natural gas exploration in coastal & offshore blocks of Bangladesh,"Bakht, D.; Rahman, Md.S.","The paper is intended to recognize Seismic Acquisition as the primary step to delineate gas reserves in estuarine, coastal and offshore areas and initiate subsequent exploration. So, analysis of environmentally critical issues and mitigation measures has important role in safe and environmentally responsible development. Bangladesh is now working under its Gas Sector Master Plan and Strategy for 2025 in meeting its energy challenges and thus offering opportunities in further exploration in coastal and offshore Blocks in 2nd &amp; 3rd round bidding process. So, the topic so opted for presentation in WGC 2009 bears high relevance to conference theme ""The Global Energy Challenge: Reviewing the Strategies for Natural Gas towards 2030"". Attempts have been made to base this paper on essential details on recent experiences and studies conducted and participated by the authors while working in a team of both international and local multidisciplinary professionals specialized in estuarine and marine biodiversity, environmental specialists, prominent socio-economists and legal experts through extensive field visits, key informant interviews and collection and review of documentary evidences contained in similar other adjacent estuarine, coastal and offshore blocks during preparation of a full scale environmental impact assessment (EIA) report for obtaining approval of Department of Environment for launching seismic acquisition involving 2D / 3D seismic survey in one such exploration blocks involving both onshore and offshore lead areas of Bangladesh. Accordingly, it has reflected the extracts from other EIA reports done for adjacent offshore blocks, reference websites, literature reviews, public and stakeholders concerns, applicable legal and regulatory framework and the seismic operational activity descriptions including data acquisition procedure alternatives to choose from. Hence, It is expected that the generic and classical content of the presentation would tremendously benefit the operators and the professionals who are already working in the gas and environmental sectors of Bangladesh including its development partners and also attract attention of the prospective investors in Exploration &amp; Production of natural gas in offshore blocks of Bangladesh and the adjoining neighborhood region in the Bay of Bengal.",2009,,,3,,2296-2327,,,,#21123,Bakht 2009,,
Flow chart design of small experimental facility for LNG receiving terminal,"Zhang, X.; Peng, S.; Liang, J.","The LNG receiving terminal is used to unload, save and boil off the liquefied natural gas transferred by the marine LNG tanker before it is sent to the customer. Cooperated with the PTC, IRC designed a small experimental facility with rated flow rate of 2 m3·h-1 to simulate the operation and manipulation process of a practical LNG receiving terminal. Inside the general unload, save and boil off processes, the facility can provide the experimental base for the LNG flow characteristics, inspection of the cryogenic valve and the risk evaluation in case of the LNG leakage, and the extensive construction in the future is also considered. The aim of the facility is to accumulate the operating and manipulating experience on the aspect of the LNG receiving terminal.

Global Retail Chains and Poor Farmers: Evidence from Madagascar,"Minten, B.; Randrianarison, L.; Swinnen, J.F.M.","Global retail companies (""supermarkets"") have an increasing influence on developing countries, through foreign investments and/or through the imposition of their private standards. The impact on developing countries and poverty is often assessed as negative. In this paper we show the opposite, based on an analysis of primary data collected to measure the impact of supermarkets on small contract farmers in Madagascar, one of the poorest countries in the world. Almost 10,000 farmers in the Highlands of Madagascar produce vegetables for supermarkets in Europe. In this global supply chain, small farmers' micro-contracts are combined with intensive farm assistance and supervision programs to fulfill complex quality requirements and phyto-sanitary standards of supermarkets. Small farmers that participate in these contracts have higher welfare, more income stability and shorter lean periods. We also find significant effects on improved technology adoption, better resource management and spillovers on the productivity of the staple crop rice. The small but emerging modern retail sector in Madagascar does not (yet) deliver these benefits as they do not (yet) request the same high standards for their supplies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"Modelling the spatial distribution of red grouper (Epinephelus morio) at Campeche Bank, México, with respect substrate","Albañez-Lucero, M.O.; Arreguín-Sánchez, F.","The red grouper (Epinephelus morio) has historically been one of the most important fisheries of the Campeche Bank area in the Gulf of México, where two fleets from México and one from Cuba participate. Current stocks have been estimated to be a third or less as abundant as in the 1970s; hence, the fishery has been declared to be over-exploited. The federal government of México has expressed the need to investigate the potential use of protected areas as a management tool for recovery of this species. Based on artificial neural network (ANN) modelling, we analysed the spatial distribution of red grouper with respect substrate, considering the demographic structure of the stock. We found a significant relationship between the type of substrate and the three stages of development (juveniles, pre-adults and adults). Juveniles are distributed in shallow waters close to the coast on coral substrates; pre-adults are also associated with coral substrates, but at an intermediate depth; adults are found in deeper waters on sandy substrates. We also identified seasonal reproductive aggregation patterns, always in relation to substrate types. Reproductive aggregation during the winter and early spring in the north-eastern continental shelf and the almost permanent (exception in autumn) concentration of juveniles in coastal waters around the central and eastern coast of Yucatan are of particular importance for management. These patterns represent seasons and areas of high fish vulnerability, which is the basic criterion for further analysis of protected areas. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This index takes into account the main physical, biological and socio-economical characteristics by means of three intermediate indexes. Three different integration methods (worst-case, average and survey-based) along with ESI-based vulnerability scores, VESI, proposed for the Cantabrian coast during the Prestige oil spill, have been analyzed and compared in terms of agreement between the classifications obtained with each one for this coastal area. Results of this study indicate that the use of the worst-case index, VR, leads to a conservative ranking, with a very poor discrimination which is not helpful in coastal oil spill risk management. Due to the homogeneity of this coastal stretch, the rest of the methods, VI, VM and VESI, provide similar classifications. However, VM and VI give more flexibility allowing three indexes for each coastal segment and including socio-economic aspects. Finally, the VI procedure is proposed here as the more advisable as using this index promotes the public participation that is a key element in the implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (IZCM). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Hawaii's real life marine park: Interpretation and impacts of commercial marine tourism in the Hawaiian Islands,"Wiener, C.S.; Needham, M.D.; Wilkinson, P.F.","The Hawaiian Islands are a popular tourism destination for over seven million travelers annually. Commercial marine tourism in Hawai'i (e.g., snorkel and dive trips, wild dolphin swims, whale watching) is a multi-million dollar industry attracting visitors from around the world. By using proper interpretation, these operators may reduce some impacts on the marine environment. This article examines marine tour excursion practices and interpretation through analysis of participant observations on 29 tour boats and semi-structured interviews with 59 tour boat employees, operators, and other experts in the Hawaiian Islands. Results show that many operators and clients participate in depreciative behaviors such as dumping food scraps, feeding fish, trampling coral, and harassing marine life. The majority of tour companies offer some form of interpretation, but overlook aspects of the environment and focus primarily on equipment use and personal safety.

Present rate of uplift in Fennoscandia from GRACE and absolute gravimetry,"Steffen, H.; Gitlein, O.; Denker, H.; Müller, J.; Timmen, L.","Fennoscandia is a key region for studying effects of glacial isostatic adjustment. The associated mass variations can be detected by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, which observes the Earth's gravity field since April 2002, as well as by absolute gravimetry field campaigns. Since 2003, annual absolute gravity (AG) measurements have been performed in Fennoscandia by the Institut für Erdmessung (IfE, Institute of Geodesy) of the Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany, within a multi-national cooperation. This offers a unique opportunity for validation and evaluation of the GRACE results. In this preliminary study, the GRACE results are compared to secular gravity changes based on the surveys from 2004 to 2007 with the FG5-220 gravimeter of the IfE. The results from GRACE monthly solutions provided by different analysis centres show temporal gravity variations in Fennoscandia. The included secular variations are in good agreement with former studies. The uplift centre is located west of the Bothnian Bay, the whole uplift area comprises Northern Europe. Nevertheless, the differences between the GRACE solutions are larger than expected and the different centre-specific processing techniques have a very strong effect on possible interpretations of GRACE results. The comparison of GRACE to the AG measurements reveals that the determined trends fit well with results from GRACE at selected stations, especially for the solution provided by the GFZ. Variations of land hydrology clearly influence results from GRACE and the AG measurements. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Strategic analysis methodology for energy systems with remote island case study,"Krumdieck, S.; Hamm, A.","A strategic analysis methodology is presented for adaptive energy systems engineering to realize an optimal level of service in the context of a community's social, economic, and environmental position. The groundwork stage involves characterizing the social context, assessing available energy resources, identifying environmental issues, setting eco-resource limits, and quantifying socio-economic constraints for a given region. A spectrum of development options is then constructed according to the range of energy service levels identified for the sector under study. A spectrum of conceptual energy systems is generated and infrastructure investments and resource use are modeled. The outcome is a matrix of energy system investment possibilities for the range of energy demand levels reflecting the values, ideas, and expectations expressed by the community. These models are then used to assess technical feasibility and economic, environmental and social risk. The result is an easily understood graphical depiction of local aspirations, investment options, and risks which clearly differentiates development opportunities from non-viable concepts. The approach was applied to a case study on Rotuma, an isolated Pacific Island.

A scenario-based verification technique to assess the compatibility of collaborative business processes,"De Backer, M.; Snoeck, M.; Monsieur, G.; Lemahieu, W.; Dedene, G.","Successful E-Business is based on seamless collaborative business processes. Each partner in the collaboration specifies its own rules and interaction preconditions. The verification of the compatibility of collaborative business processes, based on local and global views, is a complex task, which is critical for the success of the cooperation. The verification of process compatibility should be a key element in the design of new business alliances, which makes this verification essential in inter-organizational business process design. The advent of Web Services and Service Oriented Architectures stresses the need to solve complex business cooperations under the pressure of reduced costs and risks, combined with shorter time to market. At the same time, the message-based paradigm results in large and complex processes which makes the verification process quite hard. First the use of an atomic business activity based interaction paradigm is proposed to reduce the complexity of collaborative process models. Next, formal compatibility criteria for business processes are developed. The key construction is the notion of semantic compatibility, which can be used to assess the compatibility of the publicly exposed behavior (a.k.a. business interfaces) between business partners in joint business processes. The formal nature of this compatibility allows to give a precise indication of the degree of compatibility between cooperating business partners. It enables exhaustive lists of incompatible (i.e. unsupported scenarios) business cooperations, which is more comprehensive and complete than the typical compatible or incompatible answer to this question. Finally, complex multiple party interactions can be examined in terms of the safety of the interaction protocols. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Land cover change in western madagascar's dry deciduous forests: a comparison of forest changes in and around kirindy mite national park,"Whitehurst, A.S.; Sexton, J.O.; Dollar, L.","Western Madagascar's dry forests have suffered greater levels of deforestation than the island's humid eastern forests, and many of the largest remaining contiguous tracts of dry forest are conserved in Kirindy Mite National Park. To assist Kirindy Mite's management plan, we assessed land cover change in and around the Park, remotely sensing forest cover within the Park and an arbitrary 5-km buffer from Landsat images taken in 1990, 2000 and 2006. We then quantified forest cover and change and compared the values between the Park and buffer, interpreting the results through expert knowledge of the area. Kirindy Mite had lower rates of deforestation, higher rates of reforestation, and less net change than the unprotected zone in both 19902000 and 20002006. Park deforestation rates were approximately one third to one fourth those of the buffer, and Park reforestation rates were approximately double those of the buffer. Net change in the Park fluctuated between the two periods, with deforestation during 20002006 slightly exceeding reforestation during 19902000. All land cover changes accelerated over the study period, and disturbances in the Park were most frequent near its boundary. To maintain the forest as differences in forest cover across the Park boundary increase, we suggest including or intensifying measures to: (1) expand the Park boundary, simplifying its shape, (2) cooperate with the local people in managing a buffer zone, and (3) increase monitoring to minimize anthropogenic disturbances crossing the Park boundary. © Fauna & Flora International 2009.",2009,,ORYX,43,2,275-283,,10.1017/S0030605309001756,,#21156,Whitehurst 2009,,

Ecological and economic sustainability in fishery management: A multi-agent model for understanding competition and cooperation,"BenDor, T.; Scheffran, J.; Hannon, B.","Recent studies have shown that many marine ecosystems are experiencing an accelerating loss of population and biodiversity. It is apparent that there is a growing disparity between the available supply of fish and the desire of the growing world population to catch them. Although studies have begun to question the ecological sustainability of managed fishery systems, they often omit the corresponding effects on the economic sustainability of fishery industries. This is particularly important in rural coastal areas where the fishing industry is often a dominant employer. In this article, we analyze the interactions between economic and ecological dynamic systems using a multi-agent dynamic model of fishery management. Multiple agents (fishers) harvest multiple fish species and adapt the amount and allocation of their effort to their value functions, which are given as net profits of the fish harvest sold for a market price. This is largely unique in fishery models, since many econometric studies view fishers as represented by homogenous 'average' agents. We introduce and compare two different decision rules governing the behavior of fishers engaged in a competitive market. We demonstrate a situation where both behaviors lead to a decline of all fish stocks, as well as profits for most fishers. As an alternative, we introduce a cooperative approach in which fisheries jointly set sustainable limits for total harvest and effort that are then distributed to the fishers according to distribution rules. The simulation reveals that fish stocks and profits can stabilize at significantly higher levels in the cooperative case, leading to a continuous accumulation of capital for all fishers. This model demonstrates key aspects of overfishing conflicts that can be overcome through planned fishing quotas and cooperative market mechanisms. It also demonstrates a novel approach for simulating the dynamic behavior of heterogeneous fishers. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The legal design of the international and European Union ban on tributyltin antifouling paint: Direct and indirect effects,"Gipperth, L.","The Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships (AFS Convention), which was adopted in 2001 and will come into force in September 2008, bans the use of TBT (tributyltin) antifouling paint on ships. The EU (European Union) effectively implemented the Convention on 1 January 2008 by enforcing a similar ban. Several states have national restrictions and bans in place. The regulation on TBT antifouling paint aims at checking the risk of adverse effects on marine ecosystems. The legal and political situation is, however, characterized by complex relations between different layers of legislation, the use of several different legal techniques, and levels of ambition. The international and EU bans thereby cause some indirect effects, which are only partly included in what is seen as 'the TBT issue' and so only partly assessed in the legal process of the ban. This article discusses the expediency of the existing legislation and legal strategies aimed at reducing the negative environmental effects of TBT-like toxins in marine ecosystems and indirect effects of such actions.

Implications of the ban on organotins for protection of global coastal and marine ecology,"Sonak, S.; Pangam, P.; Giriyan, A.; Hawaldar, K.","Organotin-based antifouling paints are highly effective against most fouling organisms, and their application results in a large amount of savings for the shipping industry. On the other hand, TBT (tributyltin) in antifouling paints is described as the most toxic substance ever introduced into the marine environment. Consequential environmental impacts of TBT led to its regulation in many countries, although concerns were raised regarding the complete prohibition of organotin-based compounds in antifouling paints. Serious concerns were also raised regarding the complete banning of organotins. After long deliberations, the AFS Convention (convention to control the use of harmful antifouling systems on ships) was adopted on 5 October 2001.

Apart from a roadmap to the forenamed transaction guarantees, this work's contribution is basically a full-fledged methodology for building and validating high-level protocol models and for proving payment transaction guarantees by model checking them from different participants perspectives (payer perspective, as well as payee perspective). Our approach lies on the use of Colored Petri Nets and the CPN Tools environment (i) for editing and analyzing protocol models, (ii) for proving the required transaction guarantees by CTL-based (Computation Tree Temporal Logic) model checking and (iii) for evaluating the need of candidate security requirements. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Natural tracers for identifying the origin of the thermal fluids emerging along the Aegean Volcanic arc (Greece): Evidence of Arc-Type Magmatic Water (ATMW) participation,"Dotsika, E.; Poutoukis, D.; Michelot, J.L.; Raco, B.","The Aegean volcanic arc is the result of a lithosphere subduction process during the Quaternary time. Starting from the Soussaki area, from west to east, the arc proceeds through the islands of Egina, Methana, Milos, Santorini, the Columbus Bank, Kos and Nisyros. Volcano-tectonic activities are still pronounced at Santorini and Nisyros in form of seismic activity, craters of hydrothermal explosions, hot fumaroles and thermal springs. A significant number of cold water springs emerge in the vicinity of hot waters on these islands. Chemical and isotopic analyses were applied on water and fumaroles samples collected in different areas of the volcanic arc in order to attempt the assessment of these fluids. Stable isotopes of water and carbon have been used to evaluate the origin of cold and thermal water and CO2. Chemical solute concentrations and isotopic contents of waters show that the fluids emerging in Egina, Soussaki, Methana and Kos areas represent geothermal systems in their waning stage, while the fluids from Milos, Santorini and Nisyros proceed from active geothermal systems. The δ2H-δ18O-Cl- relationships suggest that the parent hydrothermal liquids of Nisyros and Milos are produced through mixing of seawater and Arc-Type Magmatic Water (ATMW), with negligible to nil contribution of local ground waters and with very high participation of the magmatic component, which is close to 70% in both sites. A very high magmatic contribution to the deep geothermal system could occur at Santorini as well, perhaps with a percentage similar to Nisyros and Milos, but it cannot be calculated because of steam condensation heavily affecting the fumarolic fluids of Nea Kameni before the surface discharge. The parent hydrothermal liquid at Methana originates through mixing of local groundwaters, seawater and ATMW, with a magmatic participation close to 19%. All in all, the contribution of ATMW is higher in the central-eastern part of the Aegean volcanic arc than in the western sector. This difference, which is spotted in the variable isotopic composition of the sampled fluids from west to east along the arc, is probably due to several causes, including the tectonic regime, the depth of the deep reservoir below sea level, the age of volcanic activity and in general the geomorphologic state of each island. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Particularly sensitive sea areas and the law of the sea,"Kraska, J.","The international community has developed several concepts that provide special status and enhanced regulation for environmental protection throughout large areas of the high seas and exclusive economic zones. These concepts include ""special areas"" under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78), High Seas Marine Protected Areas (HSMPAs) and the nascent concept of Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs). Since the advent of the first Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 1990, PSSAs have become ubiquitous. Any IMO member government may propose a PSSA for any area of the marine environment it considers in need of special protection because of the area's significance due to ecological, socio-economic or scientific attributes. Since the approval of the Great Barrier Reef PSSA (Australia) in 1990, the trend toward demarcating PSSAs that extend into the exclusive economic zone has accelerated. The list of PSSAs now includes the archipelago of Sabana-Camagüey (Cuba), Malpelo Island (Colombia), the Florida Keys (United States), the Wadden Sea (Netherlands, Denmark and Germany), Paracas National Reserve (Peru), Western European Waters (Belgium, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom), Canary Islands (Spain), the Baltic Sea (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Sweden), Galapagos Islands (Ecuador), the Torres Strait extension of the Great Barrier Reef (Australia and Papua New Guinea), and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (United States). A PSSA may be proposed only in conjunction with ""associated protective measures"" (APMs), which are within the cognizance of the IMO or which should be available as a generally applicable measure within the competence of IMO. Existing PSSA protective measures include traffic separation schemes (TSS), areas to be avoided (ATBAs), reporting obligations, discharge prohibitions, no anchoring areas, traffic monitoring, recommended routes and deep water channel routes, and the most controversial, recommendatory (or mandatory) pilotage and ship reporting. The growth in the number of PSSAs since 1990 and the trend toward increasing regulation gives rise to concern over the potential for PSSAs to impair freedom of navigation and overflight of foreign flagged vessels and aircraft. If not developed through consensus and carefully and responsibly managed by coastal States, APMs that arise from the PSSA process could lead to restrictions on the exercise of high seas freedoms in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), impair the right of transit passage through straits used for international navigation and weaken the right of innocent passage. The author participated in drafting the current IMO PSSA guidelines (released by IMO in 2005), and in sessions of the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee, which resulted in approval of PSSAs for the Baltic Sea and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. These experiences suggest that differences in interpretation, deeply held views on the role of the IMO, different perspectives on the distribution of authority among flag States, coastal States and port States in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and competing national and international maritime priorities are converging to increase scrutiny in the process for identifying and approving PSSAs and adopting APMs. If not approached cautiously and deliberately, PSSAs could destabilize the careful balance of interests between coastal States and the international maritime community of nations reflected in UNCLOS.",2009,,Center for Oceans Law and Policy,13,,511-572,,10.1163/ej.9789004173590.i-624.152,,#21172,Kraska 2009,,

However, there are few data from Asian populations and from women. We sought to determine the sex- and region-specific associations between height and cardiovascular outcomes, and deaths due to cancer, respiratory and injury in populations from the Asia-Pacific region. Methods: Thirty-nine studies from the Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration database were included. We used Cox proportional hazard regression models to estimate the associations between height and pre-specified outcomes. Results: A total of 510 800 participants with 21 623 deaths were included. Amongst men, inverse linear associations were observed between height and coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, CVD, injury and total mortality. The hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals, (CI)] for a 1-SD (= 6 cm) increment in height ranged from 0.85 (0.80-0.91) for injury to 0.97 (0.95-0.98) for total mortality. Similar trends were found between height and CHD, haemorrhagic stroke and CVD in women. A positive linear association was observed between height and cancer mortality. For each standard deviation greater height, the risk of cancer was increased by 5% (2-8%) and 9% (5-14%) in men and women, respectively. No regional difference was observed between Asian and Australasian cohorts. Adjusting for markers of education did not alter the results. Conclusions: The opposing relationships of height with CVD and cancer suggest that care is required in setting national policies on childhood nutrition lest they have unintended consequences on the incidence of major non-communicable diseases.

"When Family Means More (or Less) Than Genetics: The Intersection of Culture, Family, and Genomics","Burns McGrath, B.; Edwards, K.L.","There is renewed interest in the use of family history to predict individual disease susceptibility, and as a result, standardized online family history tools are being developed and marketed as a “new genetic test.” It is not known how cultural variations in definitions of family influence collection of these data or what is the best format to use. This is significant given that the populations who carry the greatest burden of the target diseases have not been considered in efforts to test these tools. A qualitative study with a convenience sample of 19 Japanese Americans and Samoan Americans, two groups at high risk for type 2 diabetes, was conducted to explore the process of collecting family history. A particularly strong finding was the high degree of acceptance experienced by the participants with the process and their pride in visualizing their family graphically displayed in pedigrees. It was also found that Samoans included those linked by nonbiological ties in their families, which reflects their cultural practices. Further research is needed to assess the most effective and efficient way to gather family history given the complexities surrounding the deceptively simple concept of family. © 2009, SAGE Publications.

Energetic demands during incubation and chick rearing in a uniparental and a biparental shorebird breeding in the high arctic,"Tulp, I.; Schekkerman, H.; Bruinzeel, L.W.; Jukema, J.; Visser, G.H.; Piersma, T.","Rearing of young has long been considered the energetically most demanding phase of the avian breeding cycle. Arctic-breeding shorebirds expend large amounts of energy during breeding. Because they are too small to carry sufficient stores to sit out the incubation period, they regularly interrupt incubation to feed and still can run short of energy, particularly in species in which one adult takes care of the eggs and chicks alone (uniparental). We measured daily energy expenditure (DEE) and time budgets during incubation and chick rearing in the smallest uniparental Arctic shorebird, the Little Stint (Calidris minuta). Daily energy expenditure decreased with increasing temperature but did not differ between the incubation and chick-rearing periods. Because of the increase in potential foraging time from incubation to the chick-rearing phase, the foraging intake rate required to balance the budget dropped by two-thirds. To evaluate the effect of uniparental care on energy budgets, we also measured DEE in the Dunlin (C. alpina), a sympatric congener in which both parents incubate but the female deserts the brood after hatching. Daily energy expenditure decreased with temperature, was the same during incubation and chick rearing, and was higher in males. Our results are discussed in relation to the timing of breeding of Arctic shorebirds with different systems of parental care. © 2009 by The American Ornithologists' Union.

At intake, 926 out of 1,140 women were nonadherent to recommended Pap test screening guidelines. Most participants were age 51 and older, had a high school education or higher, had been in the U.S. less than a decade, had annual household incomes less than $10,000, and were uninsured. Women with limited resources were more likely to get a Pap test after participating in ENCOREplus. Women from the Glendale site were almost 18 times more likely to get a Pap test than API women in other sites.

Group territoriality as a form of cooperative breeding in the flightless Kagu (Rhynochetos jubatus) of New Caledonia,"Thuerksuf, J.; Rouys, S.; Mériot, J.M.; Gula, R.","Birds that live in family groups and cooperatively defend the family's territory are currently recognized as cooperative breeders only if helpers assist with chick rearing. We observed breeding Kagus (Rhynochetos jubatus) and video-monitored nests to determine whether help with feeding or family size affected their reproductive success. During >5,500 h of nest monitoring, helpers never provided parents or chicks with food. The reproductive success of families increased with group size nonetheless. Family size affected breeding success more than habitat-related parameters. Nonbreeding Kagus reacted to playback calls as often as breeding birds did. Observations of territorial fights gave additional evidence that nonbreeding group members help defend the family's territory and can, therefore, improve reproductive success. Our results suggest that cooperative territory-defense was the most important factor that increased the breeding success of Kagus. We propose that group territoriality should be considered a form of cooperative breeding. © 2009 by The American Ornithologists' Union.

Isla Hispaniola: A trans-boundary flood risk mitigation plan,"Brandimarte, L.; Brath, A.; Castellarin, A.; Baldassarre, G.D.","It is sadly known that over the past decades Isla Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) has been exposed to the devastating passage of several hurricanes and tropical storms. Territories that are economically weak and extremely poor in terms of natural resources have been shaken by severe flood events that caused the loss of thousands of human lives, displacement of people and damage to the environment. On May 24th 2004, the flooding of the trans-boundary river Soliette killed over 1000 Haitian and Dominican people, wiping out villages and leaving behind desolation and poverty. After this catastrophic flood event, the General Direction for Development and Cooperation of the Italian Department of Foreign Affairs funded through the Istituto Italo-Latino Americano (IILA, www.iila.org) an international cooperation initiative (ICI), coordinated and directed by the University of Bologna. The ICI involved Haitian and Dominican institutions and was twofold: (a) institutional capacity building on flood risk management and mitigation measures and policies; (b) hydrological and hydraulic analysis of the May 2004 flood event aimed at formulating a suitable and affordable flood risk mitigation plan, consisting of structural and non-structural measures. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling farm households for estimating the efficiency of policy instruments on sustainable land use in Haiti,"Dolisca, F.; McDaniel, J.M.; Shannon, D.A.; Jolly, C.M.","Degradation of natural resources in Haiti has been a growing concern to foresters, environmentalists, and local populations. Various approaches based on ""participatory"", ""fines and taxes"" and ""command and control"" regulations, have been unsuccessfully implemented to persuade farm households to adopt conservation measures.

Tree tangle din tree : Re - Siting poetry through asl,"Davidson, M.","At a conference on disability studies, Simi Linton spoke about Casey Martin, the golfer who was denied access to the PGA national golf tour because, as someone with a mobility impairment, he needed to ride in an electric cart. As Linton pointed out, Martin's disability is not located in the game of golf-which he plays spectacularly-but in the rules by which golf tournaments are conducted. This prompted Linton to meditate on the seemingly unproblematic meaning of institutions and activities when they are limited to an able-bodied individual. The big question, she mused, is: ""What is the game of golf?""1 This is a not insignificant issue because it forces us to reevaluate impairment not from the standpoint of a physical condition but from the environment in which that condition gains meaning. Is golf radically different when it is played by someone who rides rather than walks from tee to tee? The same question could be asked of poetry when it is regarded from the perspective of poets who utilize American Sign Language (ASL)-for whom poetry is no longer governed by the voice, page, or writing. Although poets often describe their work as emanating from the body and voice, these tropes mean something quite different when literalized by poets who sign their poems by and on the body and whose voice is removed from some interior space of the body and represented on its surface. When Walt Whitman (2002) claims that ""my voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,"" he suggests a metaphoric expansion of poetry beyond its phenomenological origins and extended through the medium of print.2 But when Peter Cook of the Flying Words Project sends language ""around the world"" by throwing the fingerspelled letter L into space, language ceases to be a metaphor for extension and becomes, visibly, a ""flying word"" in space (Flying Words Project n.d.). On the model of Linton's golf metaphor, we might ask the big question, ""What is poetry?"" When considered from the standpoint of sign language, and more particularly for our own era, what is modernist poetry when its ocularcentrism is re-sited through sign?3 This latter question requires some contextualization. At the level of cultural production, ocularcentrism is manifested in the retinal aesthetics of modernist art. Cubism, Futurism, Constructivism, and Fauvism all have, at their core, a critique of single-point perspective in place since the early modern period. Post- Impressionist work in its various modalities fractures the unity of the object as well as the (presumed) perspectival integrity of the viewing subject. Literary counterparts to the visual arts-Imagism, Vorticism, Objectivism-emphasize visual clarity and economy against the expressivism and rhetorical abstractions of late Romanticism. The various metaphors for modernist distanciation, whether via Ezra Pound's ideogram, T. S. Eliot's objective correlative, Louis Zukofsky's object ""brought to a focus,"" or Gertrude Stein's filmic repetition- privilege the eye in poetry as a way of achieving, as Pound said, ""an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time"" (Pound n.d., 4). Such emphasis on the visual is reinforced by what Joseph Frank has called ""spatial form"" in modern literature. According to Frank, modernist literature aspires to the condition of the visual arts by creating the illusion of a simultaneous apprehension-as though the entire work could be read all at once. Whether in Joyce's or Eliot's use of myth, Proust's epiphanic moments, or Woolf's stream-ofconsciousness narration, modernist formal innovation jettisons linear, developmental narrative in favor of a ""space logic"" of simultaneity (Frank 1963, 13). Frank's ahistorical reading of modernism is, of course, symptomatic of New Critical formal values which, in an attempt to repudiate more biographical or historical contexts of literature, place emphasis on the literary work as a ""verbal icon"" (William Wimsatt) or symbol (I. A. Richards) or ""miraculist fusion"" of disparate particulars (John Crowe Ransom). The ""space logic"" of modernism is a local version of a much larger epistemological break within social modernity in which knowledge, far from being a disinterested arena, is aligned with forms of power based on sight. Michel Foucault notes that within modernity, from the seventeenth century on, the body becomes increasingly governed and scrutinized through forms of ""bio-power,"" those technologies and institutions that taxonomize and discipline bodies. With bio-power, the optical is invested with an ability to govern and control quite apart from its relation to the senses. Late-nineteenth-century sciences of statistics or eugenics or comparative anatomy and institutions such as the modern penal system or the asylum participate in making the body visible for purposes of measurement and control. While it is tempting to find alliances between the institutions of bio-power and the racial politics of Pound, Marinetti, or Eliot, it is equally possible to see their verbal experimentation as a repudiation of the panoptical qualities of modern urban life. Disability scholars have understood how Foucault's critique of bio-power relates significantly to persons with physical or cognitive impairments.4 Shelley Tremain (2005) refers to the ""asylums, income support programs, quality of life assessments, workers' compensation benefits, special education programs, regimes of rehabilitation, parallel transit systems, prostheses, home care services, telethons, sheltered workshops, poster child campaigns, and prenatal diagnosis"" by which bio-politics makes people with disabilities visible (5-6). Many Deaf poets and storytellers make the institutionalization of oralist education, the historical attacks on sign language, and the (presumed) linkage between deafness and mental illness a centerpiece of their work. In one of their works, ""I Am Ordered Now to Talk,"" Peter Cook and Kenny Lerner of the Flying Words Project compare the repression of sign language by oralist educators to an act of lobotomy. Their performance elaborates on a popular conflation of deaf with dumb, in every sense of the term, for which the historical incarceration of poor and indigent deaf persons in asylums was often a social remedy. The disciplining of deafness has had national implications as well. As Douglas Baynton (1996) and Jane Berger (2005) have pointed out, post-Civil War oralist education in the United States was directly tied to projects of national consolidation and citizenship. Deaf individuals, who in the antebellum period had created communities around residential schools in which ASL was encouraged, were now subjected to disciplinary action for using sign language. Manual signing became the visible representation of a deaf citizen's linguistic-and presumably characterological-deviance that had to be coerced back into the national fabric. In this respect, deaf persons joined Native Americans, immigrants, and ex-slaves whose visibility as noncitizen subjects was monitored by epidemiological and medical discourses. © 2008 by Gallaudet University.

A comparison between modal push-over and nonlinear dynamic response type offshore platforms subjected to strong ground motions,"Roshandel Tavana, M.A.; Asgarian, B.","Nonlinear dynamic analysis for offshore structures has been a major challenge in marine structures and earthquake engineering. Nonlinear Dynamic Analysis of the structures subjected to strong ground motions is the most reliable prediction method. This method is very complex and expensive. An alternative procedure that has found to be much applicable in recent years is the nonlinear static analysis called push-over analysis method. Many attempts have been made to improve the predictive capabilities of the push-over analysis, particularly by employing adaptive load patterns and accounting for higher modes of vibration effects through modal push-over. In this paper, modal push-over analysis (MPA) of jacket type offshore platforms considering soil-pile-structure interaction subjected to strong ground motion has been studied and the results have been compared with ""exact"" nonlinear response history analysis (NLRHA). A jacket type offshore platform includes of piles, jacket and deck with different behaviors during strong ground motion. In this paper, three-dimensional model of jacket and pile has been considered using a combination of finite element method (FEM) and beam on nonlinear winkler foundation (BNWF) approach in an integrated model. Both jacket and pile elements have been modeled using fiber sections. The model has been developed using Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSEES) software. In this paper, nonlinear seismic analysis of a new designed jacket type offshore platform located in Persian Gulf subjected to different levels of earthquake has been performed and the results have been compared with MPA ones. It can be concluded that the error percentage in MPA procedure is negligible when more modes of vibration are participated in the evaluation of the structure behavior.

Distribution of economic benefits from ecotourism: A case study of Wolong Nature Reserve for Giant Pandas in China,"He, G.; Chen, X.; Liu, W.; Bearer, S.; Zhou, S.; Cheng, L.Y.; Zhang, H.; Ouyang, Z.; Liu, J.","Ecotourism is widely promoted as a conservation tool and actively practiced in protected areas worldwide. Theoretically, support for conservation from the various types of stakeholder inside and outside protected areas is maximized if stakeholders benefit proportionally to the opportunity costs they bear. The disproportional benefit distribution among stakeholders can erode their support for or lead to the failure of ecotourism and conservation. Using Wolong Nature Reserve for Giant Pandas (China) as an example, we demonstrate two types of uneven distribution of economic benefits among four major groups of stakeholders. First, a significant inequality exists between the local rural residents and the other types of stakeholder. The rural residents are the primary bearers of the cost of conservation, but the majority of economic benefits (investment, employment, and goods) in three key ecotourism sectors (infrastructural construction, hotels/restaurants, and souvenir sales) go to other stakeholders. Second, results show that the distribution of economic benefits is unequal among the rural residents inside the reserve. Most rural households that benefit from ecotourism are located near the main road and potentially have less impact on panda habitat than households far from the road and closer to panda habitats. This distribution gap is likely to discourage conservation support from the latter households, whose activities are the main forces degrading panda habitats. We suggest that the unequal distribution of the benefits from ecotourism can be lessened by enhancing local participation, increasing the use of local goods, and encouraging relocation of rural households closer to ecotourism facilities. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2008,,Environmental Management,42,6,1017-1025,,10.1007/s00267-008-9214-3,,#21189,He 2008,,

Protein markers of algal toxin contamination in shellfish,"Ronzitti, G.; Milandri, A.; Scortichini, G.; Poletti, R.; Rossini, G.P.","Filter-feeding bivalve molluscs are often contaminated by algal toxins. We have probed whether proteomic analysis of extracts from the digestive gland (DG) of mussels could be employed to identify biomarkers of contamination due to okadaic acid-group toxins. The protein extracts were obtained from 18 separate mussel samples and were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. When samples were divided into four different classes based on the content of OA-group toxins in the starting material, we found that two proteins varied as a function of OA contamination. By BLAST analysis, the two proteins were identified as a component of photosystem II and a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase. The analysis of peptide homologies showed that the peptide of photosystem II we detected in extracts from the DG of mussels contaminated by OA-group toxins is identical to its counterpart in Dinophysis algae, which are the producers of this group of toxins. We concluded that proteomic analysis can be used for the detection and identification of biomarkers of biotoxin contamination in shellfish, including both proteins expressed by the toxin producers and components that participate to the tissue response to the exogenous bioactive contaminant. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Green reconstruction of the tsunami-affected areas in India using the integrated coastal zone management concept,"Sonak, S.; Pangam, P.; Giriyan, A.","A tsunami, triggered by a massive undersea earthquake off Sumatra in Indonesia, greatly devastated the lives, property and infrastructure of coastal communities in the coastal states of India, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Thailand. This event attracted the attention of environmental managers at all levels, local, national, regional and global. It also shifted the focus from the impact of human activities on the environment to the impacts of natural hazards. Recovery/reconstruction of these areas is highly challenging. A clear understanding of the complex dynamics of the coast and the types of challenges faced by the several stakeholders of the coast is required. Issues such as sustainability, equity and community participation assume importance. The concept of ICZM (integrated coastal zone management) has been effectively used in most parts of the world. This concept emphasizes the holistic assessment of the coast and a multidisciplinary analysis using participatory processes. It integrates anthropocentric and eco-centric approaches. This paper documents several issues involved in the recovery of tsunami-affected areas and recommends the application of the ICZM concept to the reconstruction efforts. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental implications for disaster preparedness: Lessons Learnt from the Indian Ocean Tsunami,"Srinivas, H.; Nakagawa, Y.","The impact of disasters, whether natural or man-made, not only has human dimensions, but environmental ones as well. Environmental conditions may exacerbate the impact of a disaster, and vice versa, disasters tend to have an impact on the environment. Deforestation, forest management practices, or agriculture systems can worsen the negative environmental impacts of a storm or typhoon, leading to landslides, flooding, silting, and ground/surface water contamination. We have only now come to understand these cyclical causes and impacts and realize that taking care of our natural resources and managing them wisely not only assures that future generations will be able to live in sustainable ways, but also reduces the risks that natural and man-made hazards pose to people living today. Emphasizing and reinforcing the centrality of environmental concerns in disaster management has become a critical priority, requiring the sound management of natural resources as a tool to prevent disasters and lessen their impacts on people, their homes, and livelihoods. As the horrors of the Asian tsunami of December 2004 continue to be evaluated, and people in the region slowly attempt to build a semblance of normalcy, we have to look to the lessons learnt from the tsunami disaster as an opportunity to prepare ourselves better for future disasters. This article focuses on findings and lessons learnt on the environmental aspects of the tsunami, and its implications on disaster preparedness plans. This article essentially emphasizes the cyclical interrelations between environments and disasters, by studying the findings and assessments of the recent Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that struck on 26 December 2004. It specifically looks at four key affected countries - Maldives, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Thailand. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Factors associated with marine injuries during vertical chute evacuation training,"Harwood, D.; Farrow, A.","Background: The use of a vertical chute marine evacuation system (MES) is now established on marine vessels; this system has, however, been associated with injuries during training. Aims: To identify risk factors associated with adverse outcomes during vertical chute MES training and to generate hypotheses for research into reducing injuries. Methods: Cross-sectional questionnaire study of a cohort of trainees attending vertical chute MES training courses, at two naval training establishments in 2005. Incident data were also collected from both training establishments and from Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) records. Results: The response rate was 99% (n = 351). Pearson chi square and relative risks (RRs) were calculated for specific outcomes with a number of independent variables. Logistic regression was used to analyse independent variables with a statistically significant (P < 0.05) chi square for the outcome of 'suffering an injury' during training. Injury was associated with body mass index denoting 'overweight', 'obese' or 'morbidly obese' with an odds ratio (OR) of 12.7 (95% CI: 2.2-72.7). Participants below the mean height also had increased risk of suffering an injury during training (OR: 4.8; 95% CI: 1.2-18.5). Phobias and apprehension prior to training increased the risk of injury; reporting of 'some concern over the dark' was statistically significant (OR: 16.6; 95% CI: 1.6-171.5). Life jacket discomfort was also significantly associated with suffering an injury. Conclusion: Policy implications include alteration of the MES design and management of risk through training and informed decision making for choosing an evacuation system for ships and ferries. © The Author 2008.

"Coping with the Asian tsunami: Perspectives from Tamil Nadu, India on the determinants of resilience in the face of adversity","Rajkumar, A.P.; Premkumar, T.S.; Tharyan, P.","The Asian tsunami of December 26, 2004 wreaked havoc along the southeastern coast of India and resulted in devastating losses. The high rates of long-term mental health consequences in adult survivors predicted immediately after the disaster have not been borne out by recent surveys. This qualitative study explored the psychological impact of the tsunami on survivors with a view to gaining insights into the ethno-cultural coping mechanisms of affected communities and evaluating resilience in the face of incomprehensible adversity. We conducted focus group discussions 9 months after the tsunami with two groups of fishermen, two groups of housewives, a group of village leaders and a group of young men in four affected villages of Nagapattinam district in Tamil Nadu, India. In spite of incomplete reconstruction of their lives, participants reconstructed meaning for the causes and the aftermath of the disaster in their cultural idiom. Qualitative changes in their social structure, processes and attitudes towards different aspects of life were revealed. Survivors valued their unique individual, social and spiritual coping strategies more than formal mental health services. Their stories confirm the assertion that the collective response to massive trauma need not necessarily result in social collapse but also includes positive effects. The results of this study suggest that interventions after disaster should be grounded in ethno-cultural beliefs and practices and should be aimed at strengthening prevailing community coping strategies. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluating a massage therapy training and treatment programme in a remote Aboriginal community,"Paterson, C.; Vindigni, D.; Polus, B.; Browell, T.; Edgecombe, G.","Objective: To describe a massage therapy and training programme in a remote Aboriginal community in Australia and to develop the frameworks, procedures and processes necessary for future research. Method: Self-report health questionnaires (MYMOP and W-BQ12) and an ethnographic enquiry that included participant observation and 15 interviews with clients and key informants. Results: The project was disrupted by typhoons. Baseline questionnaire responses indicate they may be suitable for this context. Qualitative analysis resulted in a conceptual model of the effects of the programme, which is consistent with a system theory approach. People's accounts were rooted in discussions of the community's history, emotional and physical distress, and limited health care resources. Community-level effects included increasing participation; strengthening local health and educational projects; and opening up new opportunities. Individual level effects included improvement in physical and emotional symptoms, improved function and the receipt of preventative care. Conclusion: As a result of this early stage research, future studies have a conceptual model to guide them and evidence that a mixed method and a participatory methodology may be the most appropriate design. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

What is the future for marine protected areas in Irish waters?,"Johnson, M.P.; Jessopp, M.; Mulholland, O.R.; McInerney, C.; McAllen, R.; Allcock, A.L.; Crowe, T.P.","The UK and Ireland, in common with most other European states, are in the middle of a period of rapid expansion in the number of marine protected areas (MPAs). Most of these areas are being designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) under the EU Habitats Directive. This level of activity will dominate the future of MPAs in Irish waters, presenting opportunities for marine conservation and potentially bringing wider benefits to society. The success of SACs is likely to depend heavily on the attitudes and engagement of people that use protected sites (stakeholders). This article reports on a stakeholder workshop where the potential benefits of, achievement of the potential of, and improvements in MPAs were discussed. A lack of baseline data and inefficient communication of existing information appear to restrict the perceived success of some existing reserves. Improvements seem possible in legislative coherence, public engagement and the science base. Resources for monitoring and managing protected areas are always likely to be stretched. Ways have to be found to make use of whatever data are available, potentially leading to public access websites for each SAC, where stakeholders can upload information. There appeared to be a broad consensus on many points in the day's discussions. In keeping with the workshop format, individual participants were invited to emphasise areas of omission, disagreement or consensus in comments that follow the main body of this article. © Royal Irish Academy.",2008,,Biology and Environment,108,1,14-Sep,,10.3318/BIOE.2008.108.1.9,,#21207,Johnson 2008,,
Integrated weight longlines with paired streamer lines - Best practice to prevent seabird bycatch in demersal longline fisheries,"Dietrich, K.S.; Melvin, E.F.; Conquest, L.","To evaluate a new technology - integrated weight longlines (IW) - as a viable seabird mitigation technology for demersal longline fisheries, we compared three experimental mitigation treatments, IW line alone, IW with paired streamer lines (IWPS) and unweighted longlines (UW) with PS (UWPS), to a control of no deterrent (UW alone). Trials took place on two vessels targeting Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) over a five-month period in the Bering Sea, Alaska, USA. We used multiple criteria for evaluations - catch rates of all taxa, seabird abundance and attack rate, and gear sink rate and performance - making this study the largest and most comprehensive experiment of its kind. All mitigation technologies dramatically decreased seabird bycatch rates while having little to no effect on fish catch rates. Mitigation was more effective for surface foraging seabirds (Fulmarus glacialis and Larus spp.) than for diving seabirds (short-tailed shearwaters, Puffinus tenuirostris), reducing mortality rates by 91-100% and 80-97%, respectively. Based on multiple criteria, IWPS performed best, sinking gear within the protection of streamer lines eliminating surface forager catch completely and reducing shearwater catch by 97%, relative to the control. UWPS, status quo in the Alaska fishery, and IW alone performed similarly reducing surface forager catch rates by 98% and 91%, respectively, and shearwater rates by 87% and 80%, respectively. Seabird abundance and attack rate were poor proxies of seabird mortality, especially for IW gear. IW lines reduced the distance astern that birds have access to sinking baits by near half and its handling qualities proved superior to UW. We conclude that IW longlines and paired streamer lines are the core mitigation techniques and when deployed together, constitute the best management practice for seabird conservation in demersal longline fisheries using autoline systems. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Macroalgae, a suitable indicator of the ecological status of coastal rocky communities in the NE Atlantic","Juanes, J.A.; Guinda, X.; Puente, A.; Revilla, J.A.","Despite the great importance of shallow rocky communities (<30 m deep) due to their contribution to the biodiversity of coastal waters, most efforts in ecological status assessment of marine waters have been carried out in the implementation of soft bottom biotic indices. Therefore, in this paper, a methodology for the environmental evaluation of coastal rocky communities for the Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic), the CFR index (Quality of Rocky Bottoms), is presented. This index is based on the analysis of seaweed communities throughout the depth gradient, from the intertidal to the shallow subtidal, through the combination of a multimetric approach, which combines the richness of characteristic macroalgae populations, their total cover, the presence of opportunistic species and the physiological condition of the whole macroalgae community. Quality thresholds for these indicators are based on both ecological data and expert judgment. Finally, a preliminary application of this metric to sites with theoretically good and bad environmental conditions is used to analyze the suitability of the index. As a result, the four selected indicators responded in a significant way to the pressure gradient tested, proving to be appropriate for the type of pressure analysed and obtaining coherent results in the final quality assessment with the CFR index. In conclusion, the CFR index has proved to be an effective tool for the assessment of the ecological quality of coastal rocky communities, based on the analysis of macroalgae assemblages. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Adaptation and mitigation strategies for controlling stochastic water pollution: An application to the Baltic Sea,"Gren, I.-M.","The purpose of this paper is to analyse and compare the costs of two strategies against transboundary water pollution, mitigation and adaptation measures, which are linked with respect to risk. Chance constraint programming is applied, and the analytical results indicate that total costs for given probabilistic targets are higher (lower) than the costs without risk linkage for negative (positive) covariance between the two classes of measures. A comparison of two international policies-cooperation and national uniform standards-indicates that cleaning under non-cooperative uniform national standards can be increased when considering stochastic pollution and linkage in risk between mitigation and adaptation measures. The empirical application to the Baltic Sea shows that the risk linkage can increase or decrease minimum costs for a given probabilistic target under cooperative solutions by 17 or 13%, and decrease the cost under national uniform policy for a given overall probabilistic target by approximately 10%. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Atmospheric aerosols over two sites in a Southeastern region of Texas,"Chiou, P.; Tang, W.; Lin, C.-J.; Chu, H.-W.; Tadmor, R.; Ho, T.C.","Speciated samples of PM2.5 were collected at the Bayland Park and Orange sites in Southeastern Texas by US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) from July 2003 to August 2005. A total of 256 samples for the Bayland Park site and 293 samples for the Orange site with 52 species were measured; however, 22 species were excluded because of too many below-detection-limit data. Among the 22 species excluded, 19 species are common to both sites. The two data sets were analyzed by positive matrix factorization (PMF) to infer the sources of PM observed at the two sites. The analysis identified ten common source-related factors: sulphate-rich secondary aerosol I, sulphate-rich secondary aerosol II, cement/carbon-rich, wood smoke, motor vehicle/road dust, nitrate-rich secondary aerosol, metal processing, soil, sea salt, and chloride-depleted marine aerosol. Sulphate and nitrate mainly exist as ammonium salts. The two sulphate-rich secondary aerosols account for about 59% and 54% of the PM2.5 mass concentration at the two sites, respectively. The factor containing highest concentrations of Cl and Na was attributed to sea salt due to the proximity of the monitoring sites to the Gulf of Mexico. The chloride-depleted marine aerosol was related to the sea salt aerosol but was identified separately due to the chlorine replacement reactions. Basically, the factor of sulphate, nitrate, and soil at the two sites showed similar chemical composition profiles and seasonal variation that reflect the regional characteristics of these sources. The regional factors showed predominantly low frequency variations, however, the area-related and local factors showed both high and low frequency variations. Motor vehicle/road dust, sea salt, and chloride-depleted marine aerosol were likely to be area-related factors. Cement/carbon-rich, wood smoke, and metal processing factor were likely to be the local sources. © 2008 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering.",2008,,Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering,86,3,421-435,,10.1002/cjce.20047,,#21213,Chiou 2008,,
Complications of diabetes in urban Indigenous Australians: The DRUID study,"Maple-Brown, L.; Cunningham, J.; Dunne, K.; Whitbread, C.; Howard, D.; Weeramanthri, T.; Tatipata, S.; Dunbar, T.; Harper, C.A.; Taylor, H.R.; Zimmet, P.; O'Dea, K.; Shaw, J.E.","Aims: To accurately assess the management and complications of type 2 diabetes in urban Indigenous Australians and compare the risk of complications with a general Australian population (AusDiab Study). Methods: The Darwin Region Urban Indigenous Diabetes (DRUID) Study included 1004 volunteers aged ≥15 years; diabetes status was classifiable for 866. The assessment of diabetic complications and metabolic control was performed in participants with known diabetes (KDM) and diabetes newly diagnosed by the study (NDM) using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and clinical examination. Results: Among 172 DRUID participants eligible for complications assessment, 135 were assessed, including 99 KDM (mean age 53 years) and 36 NDM (mean age 47 years). Percentages of KDM participants meeting therapeutic targets were: HbA1c < 7%, 29%; blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg, 45%; total cholesterol < 5.5mmol/L, 65%. Among KDM, 39% had albuminuria, 21% retinopathy, 12% peripheral vascular disease (PVD), 9% neuropathy. Factors independently associated with diabetic complications were: albuminuria-HbA1c, systolic blood pressure; retinopathy-diabetes duration; PVD-age. Compared to AusDiab participants after adjusting for other risk factors, DRUID participants had 2-3-fold increased risk of albuminuria and PVD and a non-significant increased risk of neuropathy, but no increased risk of retinopathy. Conclusions: Urban Indigenous Australians with diabetes are relatively young and have poor glycaemic control. Compared to the general Australian population with type 2 diabetes, they have greater adjusted risk of albuminuria and PVD but not retinopathy.

Impact of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on uranium accumulation by plants,"Dupré de Boulois, H.; Joner, E.J.; Leyval, C.; Jakobsen, I.; Chen, B.D.; Roos, P.; Thiry, Y.; Rufyikiri, G.; Delvaux, B.; Declerck, S.","Contamination by uranium (U) occurs principally at U mining and processing sites. Uranium can have tremendous environmental consequences, as it is highly toxic to a broad range of organisms and can be dispersed in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Remediation strategies of U-contaminated soils have included physical and chemical procedures, which may be beneficial, but are costly and can lead to further environmental damage. Phytoremediation has been proposed as a promising alternative, which relies on the capacity of plants and their associated microorganisms to stabilize or extract contaminants from soils. In this paper, we review the role of a group of plant symbiotic fungi, i.e. arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which constitute an essential link between the soil and the roots. These fungi participate in U immobilization in soils and within plant roots and they can reduce root-to-shoot translocation of U. However, there is a need to evaluate these observations in terms of their importance for phytostabilization strategies. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Using qualitative methodology to inform an Indigenous-owned oral health promotion initiative in Australia,"Jamieson, L.M.; Parker, E.J.; Richards, L.","Indigenous Australians experience poor oral health. Oral health perceptions among a group of rural-dwelling Indigenous Australians were explored so that a culturally appropriate, community-owned oral health promotion initiative might be developed. Focus group methodology was used, with prompt questions including oral health knowledge, oral health's role in general health, how community oral health had changed in recent times, the causes of poor oral health and ways to prevent poor oral health at a community level. Some 34 participants took part; age range 21-72 years. A core category emerged from the data and was labelled 'cultural adaptation'. Five sub-categories were also identified; 'lifestyle changes', 'oral health behaviours', 'barriers to dental care', 'impact of poor oral health' and 'oral health literacy'. Participants felt that historical legacy impacted on the oral health of community members, through continued practices of being told what to do, where to live and what oral health services were available to them. Participants perceived they had little power over their oral health or oral health care decisions. Findings from the focus group discussions were used in the development of a context-specific, oral health promotion initiative, which involved construction of an audiovisual tool in Phase I and a series of interactive, context-specific seminars focused on key issues raised in the focus groups in Phase II. Oral health promotion initiatives among rural-dwelling Indigenous Australians may be more successful if perceptions of the anticipated audience are considered in the design stage of such strategies. © The Author (2007).

A decision support approach for cane supply management within a sugar mill area,"Lejars, C.; Le Gal, P.-Y.; Auzoux, S.","Increased competition between agri-food supply chains has strained relationships between farmers and processing factories while reducing individual profit margins. Decisions at different levels of the supply chain can no longer be considered independently, since they may influence profitability throughout the supply chain. This paper presents a decision support approach based on the MAGI® simulation tool, which aims to facilitate discussion and negotiation between stakeholders while collectively exploring satisfactory solutions. The simulation tool helps sugarcane growers and millers in designing and assessing new ways of organizing cane supply management within a mill area. It addresses key issues such as restructuring mill areas or changing cane delivery allocation rules in order to increase total sugar production and total net revenue at the mill area level. This approach has been implemented for two mills in Réunion and one mill in South Africa. Simulations showed that sugar gains may be obtained by rearranging supply scheduling according to quality-based zoning within a mill area. Discussions led to further studies regarding the practicality of the best scenarios. MAGI® is now available as freeware for testing in different settings. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Into traditional classroom contexts in Trinidad and Barbados, a new social pedagogic method was introduced by teachers and changes in attainment and motivation of pupils and attitudes of teachers were assessed over two terms in secondary schools. Social Studies teachers participated in this action research study. They co-developed and applied a relationally based group work training programme and were provided supportive visits by a research officer between December and June of a school year. Data were collected from nearly 300 pupils in January and July, including: end-of-term, school-based attainment scores in social studies; a teacher-completed questionnaire for each child in class concerning pupil classroom performance (perceptions of knowledge, interactions with teacher and peers); and a pupil-completed questionnaire concerning attitudes to interpersonal contexts for classroom learning. In addition, reflective interviews were undertaken with pupils and teachers at the end of the programme. Over the period studied, virtually all pupils improved their social studies attainment; especially the lowest achieving pupils. Pupils improved their attitudes towards working with others and expectations of achievement in schools. Teachers' understanding of a 'good pupil' also changed-recognising of the importance of social inclusion at the classroom level and relational/groupworking skills among pupils.

Spatio-temporal changes of marine macrobenthic community in sub-tropical waters upon recovery from eutrophication. II. Life-history traits and feeding guilds of polychaete community,"Cheung, S.G.; Lam, N.W.Y.; Wu, R.S.S.; Shin, P.K.S.","A two-year study was conducted in the vicinity of a harbour in sub-tropical Hong Kong, to examine the progress of recovery of macrobenthic community, based on analyses of both life-history traits and trophic guilds of polychaetes, upon cessation of organic pollution caused by sewage discharge. Seventy seven out of 83 species collected were classified under four ecological groups based on the life-history traits and sensitivity to organic gradients. The mean ATZI marine biotic index (AMBI) derived from these ecological groups showed spatial difference among the five sampling locations. In particular, the presence of different percentages of polychaete species from Groups III (unbalanced community) and IV (polluted community) suggested the presence of pollution stress in certain degree at all sampling locations. However, no significant temporal changes were noted over the study period. From all polychaete species identified, they were classified into 13 feeding guilds. The mean diversity of these feeding guilds at most of the sampling locations was significantly higher than that at one of the inside-harbour locations. The composition of feeding guilds was also significantly different spatially. At one of the inside-harbour locations, the dominant feeding guilds were motile/discretely motile surface deposit feeders with tentaculates or unarmed pharynx, and motile omnivores with jawed pharynx in the first year of study, but were replaced by motile, jawed carnivores in the second year of study. The increased proportion of carnivores over the study period can be seen as a sign of recovery in the community structure since abundance of predators is commonly higher in habitats with better environmental quality.

"First application of marine magnetotellurics improves depth imaging in the santos basin, Brazil","De Lugao, P.P.; Fontes, S.L.; La Terra, E.F.; Zerilli, A.; Labruzzo, T.; Buonora, M.P.","Recent subsalt oil discoveries in the deep waters of the Santos Basin, Brazil, have received considerable attention due to the extent of their reserves and by the challenges in exploration and production in such environment. Recently, electromagnetic methods have re-gained attention and changes in technology are making them a powerful tool for challenging imaging environments. A first large Marine Magnetotellurics (MMT) survey was acquired in Brazil by WesternGeco Electromagnetics in cooperation with Observatorio Nacional/CNPq and Petrobras. MMT data were recorded at 96 sites along three profiles. One profile extends approximately 148 km along existing seismic. The MMT data were processed and interpreted using an advanced integrated workflow. The main objectives of the survey were to assess the response and quality of MMT data in a wide range of water depths and test the ability of MMT to enhance seismic depth imaging by providing reliable information that will be used to constrain/improve the resolution of the velocity models. We show that the MMT data can clearly enhance resolution and reduce ambiguities of depth interpretation based on seismic. Work is in progress to enhance the MMT interpretation and apply the enhanced MMT model to develop an integrated depth imaging workflow.",2008,,,6,,3338-3342,,,,#21232,DeLugao 2008,,
Community Health Navigators for Breast- and Cervical-Cancer Screening Among Cambodian and Laotian Women: Intervention Strategies and Relationship-Building Processes,"Ngoc Nguyen, T.-U.; Tanjasiri, S.P.; Kagawa-Singer, M.; Tran, J.H.; Foo, M.A.","In recent years, there has been a growing number of programs employing health navigators to assist underserved individuals in overcoming barriers to obtaining regular and quality health care. This article describes the perspectives and experiences of community-based health navigators in the Cambodian and Laotian communities involved in a REACH 2010 project to reduce health disparities in breast and cervical cancer among Pacific Islander and Southeast Asian communities in California. These community health navigators, who have extensive training and knowledge about the cultural, historical, and structural needs and resources of their communities, are well equipped to build trusting relationships with community members traditionally ignored by the mainstream medical system. By comparing the different social support roles and intervention strategies employed by community health navigators in diverse communities, we can better understand how these valuable change agents of the health workforce are effective in improving health access and healthy behaviors for underserved communities. © 2008, SAGE Publications.

Interactions of wine drinking with omega-3 fatty acids in patients with coronary heart disease: A fish-like effect of moderate wine drinking,"de Lorgeril, M.; Salen, P.; Martin, J.-L.; Boucher, F.; de Leiris, J.","Background: Moderate alcohol drinking and marine omega-3 fatty acids (ω3) have both been associated with low mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD). However, there is little data evaluating the interactions of wine ethanol drinking with ω3 in CHD patients. Methods: The relationships between wine drinking and marine ω3 were evaluated in a cross-sectional study in patients with CHD participating in a randomized trial testing the effect of a high α-linolenic acid (ALA, the main plant ω3) diet. Daily ethanol intake was calculated as energy and expressed as a percentage of total energy. Plant and marine ω3 in the diet were carefully evaluated in each patient in both groups. Results: Patients were classified according to their habitual consumption of ethanol. Patients in the ""high ALA group"" and controls (""low ALA group"") were analyzed separately. Within each group, there was a progressive increase in marine ω3 levels with increased alcohol intake, with a level of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) that increased by 50% (P < .005) and 37% (P < .05) in the low and high ALA groups, respectively. After controlling for potential confounders (including dietary EPA) in a multivariate linear model, the association between wine ethanol and EPA remained significant in the low (P < .001) and high (P < .05) ALA groups. Conclusion: In these patients with CHD, moderate wine drinking was associated with higher marine ω3 concentrations than no alcohol use. Although the data have to be confirmed in large groups, this effect of wine comparable to that of fish may partly explain the protective effects of wine drinking against CHD. © 2008 Mosby, Inc.

Toward the application of ecological concepts in EU coastal water management,"de Jonge, V.N.","The EU Water Framework Directive demands the protection of the functioning and the structure of our aquatic ecosystems. The defined means to realize this goal are: (1) optimization of the habitat providing conditions and (2) optimizing the water quality. The effects of the measures on the structure and functioning of the aquatic ecosystems then has to be assessed and judged. The available tool to do this is 'monitoring'. The present monitoring activities in The Netherlands cover target monitoring and trend monitoring. This is insufficient to meet the requirements of the EU. It is, given the EU demands, the ongoing budget reductions in The Netherlands and an increasing flow of unused new ecological concepts and theories (e.g. new theoretical insights related to resource competition theory, intermediate disturbance hypothesis and tools to judge the system quality like ecological network analysis) suggested to reconsider the present monitoring tasks among governmental services (final responsibility for the program and logistic support) and the academia (data analyses, data interpretation and development of concepts suitable for ecosystem modelling and tools to judge the quality of our ecosystems). This will lead to intensified co-operation between both arena's and consequently increased exchange of knowledge and ideas. Suggestions are done to extend the Dutch monitoring by surveillance monitoring and to change the focus from 'station oriented' to 'area oriented' without changing the operational aspects and its costs. The extended data sets will allow proper calibration and validation of developed dynamic ecosystem models which is not possible now. The described 'cost-effective' change in the environmental monitoring will also let biological and ecological theories play the pivotal role they should play in future integrated environmental management. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Look outwards, reach inwards, pass it on: The three tenures of underwater cultural heritage interpretation","Nutley, D.M.","There are probably few people, if any, who would not agree that interpretation of underwater cultural heritage is fundamental to good heritage management practice. However, there is room for discussion on who has the key responsibility for that interpretation. A common perception is that heritage managers own center stage and all interpretation should be either initiated or at least controlled by them. As a heritage manager of underwater cultural heritage for almost twenty years, I have often observed and been aware of the temptation of heritage management agencies and their representatives to operate almost as the sole player. Partnerships, comprised of corporations, individuals, and other government agencies, predominantly have been in support of projects ""owned"" by heritage management agencies. Clearly there is a place for heritage managers to be initiators, strategists, and leaders and these are essential characteristics of a good heritage management regime. What is worth exploring is how best to foster, encourage, support, and complement the skills, interests, and ambitions of ""other players"" - in other words, to work as facilitators. We need to place as much value on backing roles as we do on the lead role. While there are many circumstances where heritage management agencies can do the work themselves, there are times when as much strength may be gained by playing the role of a supporting actor. Three actions are required in order to achieve such a goal. First, looking outwards to identify the people and organizations who are the ""other players"" and what their goals, objectives, or current projects may be. Second, reaching inwards to identify which organizational goals or objectives of the heritage management agency complement those of the other players and what skills, perspectives, and other resources could be made available. The third step is to pass on those resources through appropriate delivery mechanisms and formal agreements. This approach is demonstrated through the policies and strategies employed by an Australian cultural heritage agency, the New South Wales Heritage Office's Underwater Cultural Heritage Program. The Heritage Office is located in the eastern Australian State of New South Wales and employs two maritime archaeologists. The office's Underwater Cultural Heritage Program is involved in the management of all submerged cultural heritage sites in coastal and inland waterways, including shipwrecks, port facilities, and other relics considered to be of heritage significance. This is a vast jurisdictional area. In terms of historic shipwrecks alone, there are nearly 1,800 potential sites, 273 of which have been located to date. This does not include submerged aircraft, inundated towns, and potential Indigenous sites. The State also has over 60,000 registered divers and is host to many dive shops and clubs. There is a great incentive to promote a positive environment for broad-based community and government involvement in management of underwater cultural heritage. This is reflected in a program that has a strong emphasis on education and promotion and the sharing of responsibilities with community groups, individuals, and government agencies. State Government agencies associated with the Heritage Office program include the New South Wales Marine Parks Authority, New South Wales Water Police, Manly Hydraulics Laboratory, and the New South Wales Maritime Authority. The sharing of responsibilities also extends to a Federal level. In Australia, the Federal Government requires State authorities with expertise in underwater cultural heritage management to request management responsibilities under the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976; once requested those responsibilities then are delegated to the State. That Act is administered through the Department of Environment and Heritage under delegation to appointed Delegates in the States and Territories. One of the benefits of this arrangement is that it helps to foster interaction and cooperation with other Federal departments and agencies such as the Australian National Maritime Museum and the Department of Defence. In 1987, the Heritage Branch of the Department of Planning received increasing numbers of reports of shipwrecks uncovered on beaches during storms and found by divers. Historical archaeologists in the Heritage Branch had no experience in recording, investigating, or managing these maritime sites and, as a result, drew the New South Wales Government's attention to the need for engaging expertise to deal with shipwrecks and other underwater cultural heritage. The Underwater Cultural Heritage Program commenced the following year. The Director of the Department of Planning accepted delegated responsibilities under the Historic Shipwrecks Act. This supplemented existing State responsibilities for underwater cultural heritage under the New South Wales Heritage Act 1977. This delegation was transferred to the Director of the New South Wales Heritage Office (Figure 3.1) when it was established as a separate agency in 1996. Eighteen years since it started, a strong, innovative program continues to emphasize community involvement, public access to information, the responsibilities of other government agencies, and integration with the State's environmental planning framework. The Heritage Office is an independent New South Wales Government agency within the portfolio of the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning. The office provides heritage management advice to the Minister, the New South Wales Heritage Council, and the community. Through the Historic Shipwrecks Act delegation, the Heritage Office's underwater cultural heritage program is an extension of the National Historic Shipwrecks Program. Essentially, the program is involved with the management of all submerged cultural heritage sites in coastal and inland waterways, including shipwrecks, port facilities, and other relics. In the conservation, management, and interpretation of the State's underwater heritage, the Heritage Office: ? undertakes underwater archaeological surveys; • creates education and information programs; • supports participation of private individuals and organizations in the recording, assessment, and management of underwater sites; • provides advice to local, State, and Commonwealth governments and to government agencies about management of underwater cultural heritage (Underwater Heritage, 1996:4). The Heritage Office public outreach program is based on a belief that if people understand heritage they are better able to understand and assist preservation strategies. The Heritage Office's outreach projects include publications, lectures, training courses, wreck survey projects, a ""Wreck Spotters"" network of volunteers, and extensive liaison with the dive industry and Nautical Archaeology Society training courses under the auspices of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology (AIMA). Dive clubs, community groups, university students, and government agencies respond with their own contributions such as dive experiences, family oral histories, and photographic records. A direct result of outreach projects is a marked increase in support, involvement, and understanding of underwater cultural heritage.",2007,,Out of the Blue: Public Interpretation of Maritime Cultural Resources,,,33-51,,10.1007/978-0-387-47862-3_3,,#21239,Nutley 2007,,
"Law, just war, and the international fight against terrorism: Is it war?","Weiner, A.S.","September 11 was not the first time the United States was victimized by terrorist attacks. In 1983, a truck bombing at the Beirut Airport in Lebanon killed 241 American Marines. In 1988, a bomb planted by Libyan intelligence officers detonated aboard Pan Am flight 103 as it passed over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 persons aboard. Truck bombings at the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 killed 225 people and injured thousands more. And in October 2000, suicide bombers maneuvered a small boat alongside the warship USS Cole in the port of Aden, Yemen, and triggered an explosion that killed seventeen US sailors. Nor was September 11 the first major attack by foreign terrorists on American soil. In February 1993, a massive explosion in the parking garage of the World Trade Center in New York City killed six persons and wounded more than 1,000. Yet the magnitude of the events of September 11 fundamentally changed the United States Government's approach towards international terrorism. After September 11, the Bush Administration rejected the previous American approach to counterterrorism, which had primarily employed the combined tools of diplomatic cooperation, economic sanctions, and internationally coordinated law enforcement measures. Instead, the President declared in the aftermath of September 11 that the United States was engaged in a war on terrorism.1 Subsequent statements and actions have made clear that President Bush's declaration that the United States would wage war against terrorism was not simply a spontaneous utterance, but is rather a formulation of national policy. Indeed, only a few days after press reports in July 2005 announced that administration officials would cease describing the conflict as a ""global war on terror,""2 the President publicly overruled his top advisors, saying, ""Make no mistake about it, we are at war.""3 The characterization of the United States's response to terrorism as ""war"" - or, in the parlance of international lawyers, ""armed conflict"" - has enormous implications for measures the United States may, as a legal matter, permissibly take in the course of the conflict. And yet whether the response to terrorism may properly be treated as ""war"" is far from clear. In this chapter, I argue that although the fight against terrorism does not qualify as war as a matter of positive international law, there are justifiable functional reasons for extrapolating from positive law and treating the conflict - or at least part of it - as war. But this is not the end of the inquiry. For even in war, substantive legal restraints apply. Moreover, just war theory demands reciprocity in wartime, such that the belligerents face each other with equivalent belligerent rights. Accordingly, assessing whether the exercise of wartime legal powers by the United States in the struggle against terrorism is justifiable requires us to consider not only the prima facie functional basis for treating the conflict as war. We must also evaluate whether the United States has accepted the duties that apply in wartime and the related principle of reciprocity. Because the conflict against terrorism does not satisfy the formal international law definition of war, the exercise of wartime legal authorities by the United States since September 11 is justifiable only on the basis of a functional extrapolation from positive law. By itself, this move is defensible. The United States, however, has been unwilling to accept important corresponding legal restraints that should flow from such a functional extrapolation. Nor has it been willing to confer upon its adversaries the rights to which they should be entitled as a matter of reciprocity under such an approach. This assertion of wartime rights without acceptance of corresponding wartime responsibilities undercuts the justification for the United States's effort to move beyond positive law in selecting a legal framework for the struggle against terrorism. In other words, the means by which the United States has conducted its campaign against terrorism undermines the justification for treating the conflict as ""war."" © 2007 Springer.",2007,,"Intervention, Terrorism, and Torture: Contemporary Challenges to Just War Theory",,,137-153,,10.1007/978-1-4020-4678-0_8,,#21240,Weiner 2007,,
Outreach beyond the beach: Management of historic shipwrecks on the outer continental shelf,"Ball, D.A.; Irion, J.B.; Horrell, C.E.","As resource managers, interpreting maritime cultural resources for the public is a difficult enough challenge when direct access to your site is limited to those who can scuba dive or who have access to their own personal boat. Bringing this message to the public when your site lies 65 kilometers (40 miles) offshore and 0.4 kilometers (a quarter of a mile) deep, when it requires large SHIPS and robotic equipment that can operate in pressures that would crush the human body just to visit it, and when you do not even own the site or have the legal authority to protect it from third-party damage, the challenges seem almost insurmountable. However, as the federal agency within the United States Department of the Interior that manages the nation's oil, natural gas, and other mineral resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) (Figure 12.1), the Minerals Management Service (MMS) strives to do just that by sharing with the public the exciting discoveries that are made as a by-product of exploration for oil and gas offshore. As the federal agency that administers mineral development on the OCS1, the MMS must ensure that all activities it permits take into consideration the potential effects these activities may have on environmental resources, including historic shipwrecks. For archaeological resources, this requirement is mandated through several laws, including the OCS Lands Act (OCSLA), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), Executive Order 11593, and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The NHPA of 1966 was enacted to recognize that the nation is ""founded upon and reflected in its historic heritage"" (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq., 470[b][1]). By passing this act into law, the U.S. Congress proclaimed that ""the preservation of this irreplaceable heritage is in the public interest so that its vital legacy of cultural, aesthetic, inspirational, economic, and energy benefits will be maintained and enriched for future generations"" (16 U.S.C. 470[b][4]). Section 106 of the NHPA requires federal agencies to take into account the effect of any proposed federal, federally assisted, or federally licensed undertaking on any historic property that is included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places. At present, no other historic preservation legislation applies to shipwrecks on the OCS (Varmer and Blanco, 1999). The Abandoned Shipwreck Act (43 U.S.C. 2101-2106 [effective April 28, 1988]) applies only to state waters, the National Marine Sanctuary Act (16 U.S.C. 1431, et seq.) protects only shipwrecks in National Marine Sanctuaries, and the Antiquities Act (16 U.S.C. 431 et seq.) is limited to marine protected areas such as national seashores. At present, the MMS can only exercise protection of shipwrecks with respect to its permitees and leaseholders. As it stands now, however, the MMS manages archaeological resources with respect to the projects it permits or funds through a combination of efforts which include funding baseline studies to identify known and expected locations of archaeological sites and requiring remote-sensing surveys and archaeological assessments in areas leased for oil exploration that are believed to have a high potential for containing these resources. As a result, the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) is the most thoroughly surveyed body of water on earth. These surveys, conducted by the oil and gas industry as part of their requirement for obtaining a permit from the MMS, have located numerous historic shipwrecks that are an important part of our underwater cultural heritage. As archaeologists within a public agency, we feel that it is incumbent upon us, as much as possible, to share these discoveries with the public in a way that illuminates the richness of the maritime culture lying off our shores, while protecting their locations to discourage looting. These goals are accomplished through the publication of government-funded studies, through public outreach and education programs, and through cooperation with academic programs. Much of this work focuses on the GOM inasmuch as the vast majority of industry remote-sensing surveys occur there.",2007,,Out of the Blue: Public Interpretation of Maritime Cultural Resources,,,171-181,,10.1007/978-0-387-47862-3_12,,#21242,Ball 2007,,

Future Indian earth observation systems,"Navalgund, R.R.; Jayaraman, V.; Kiran Kumar, A.S.; Dadhwal, V.K.","Indian Earth Observation (EO) capability has increased manifold since the launch of Bhasakra-1 in 1979 to Cartosat-2 in 2007. Improvements are not only in spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolutions but also in their coverage and value added products. It has also entered into the arena of passive and active microwave remote sensing, stereo viewing and viewing from the geosynchronous platform at moderately high resolution. Observations specific to oceans and atmosphere are getting further emphasis. Demand for a constellation of satellites for monitoring disaster situations is strongly made. In this context, India has made extensive plans for continuity and enhancement in EO capability, not only towards its own national needs, but also as a contributing participant towards Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). Major emphasis of the future plan has been to consolidate theme-specific satellites, in order to fill the gaps in observation including those for disaster monitoring and mitigation, and also to develop synergy with international missions for complementing and supplementing Indian missions. The future Indian EO systems include those for land applications-Resourcesat with wide swath LISS-III, high resolution Cartosat (0.3 m) and Imaging Radar (RISAT: C-band, multi-polarization).

Randomized trial testing of QueaseEase™ essential oil for motion sickness,"Post-White, J.; Nichols, W.","The aim of the study was to determine preliminary evidence of efficacy of a blended essential oil product, QueaseEase™ (QE), to reduce queasiness related to motion sickness experienced on boats. This was a randomized, blinded, two group pre and post-test design with volunteer subjects with a history of motion sickness randomly assigned to either QueaseEase™ or Placebo. QueaseEase™ is a blend of Zingiber officinale, Lavandula angustifolia, Mentha spicata, and Mentha x piperita essential oils. The placebo was distilled water, packaged in an identical carrier. Subjects were instructed to inhale the product aroma using deep breaths as often as needed and at least four times during the trip. Queasiness was assessed using a linear analogue scale of 0 (no queasiness) to 10 (worst imaginable), recorded before and after each use of the QE or placebo. Passengers also recorded symptoms, subjective responses, other methods used to manage motion sickness, and impressions of their product. Fifty-five (55) subjects participated, with 49 submitting complete data. Passengers using the QE had reduced queasiness after each use (mean change scores -0.52 to -1.14; p <0.05). The QE group had less queasiness than the placebo group at one time point in the middle of the trip (p = 0.02). Overall reports of queasiness were low, with mean scores less than 3.5. More than 80% of the QE group would likely use the product again for motion sickness. QueaseEase™ had a significant benefit each time subjects inhaled the product. QE was more effective compared with placebo when the seas were roughest, but not significant at other times. Small sample sizes, low rates of queasiness, and various times of use may have reduced the ability to detect a difference between the groups at all time points.

A model for selecting bioindicators to monitor radionuclide concentrations using Amchitka Island in the Aleutians as a case study,"Burger, J.","World War II and the Cold War have left the Unites States, and other Nations, with massive cleanup and remediation tasks for radioactive and other legacy hazardous wastes. While some sites can be cleaned up to acceptable residential risk levels, others will continue to hold hazardous wastes, which must be contained and monitored to protect human health and the environment. While media (soil, sediment, groundwater) monitoring is the usual norm at many radiological waste sites, for some situations (both biological and societal), biomonitoring may provide the necessary information to assure greater peace of mind for local and regional residents, and to protect ecologically valuable buffer lands or waters. In most cases, indicators are selected using scientific expertise and a literature review, but not all selected indicators will seem relevant to stakeholders. In this paper, I provide a model for the inclusion of stakeholders in the development of bioindicators for assessing radionuclide levels of biota in the marine environment around Amchitka Island, in the Aleutian Chain of Alaska. Amchitka was the site of three underground nuclear tests from 1965 to 1971. The process was stakeholder-initiated, stakeholder-driven, and included stakeholders during each phase. Phases included conceptualization, initial selection of biota and radionuclides, refinement of biota and radionuclide target lists, collection of biota, selection of biota and radionuclides for analysis, and selection of biota, tissues, and radionuclides for bioindicators. The process produced site-specific information on biota availability and on radionuclide levels that led to selection of site-appropriate bioindicators. I suggest that the lengthy, iterative, stakeholder-driven process described in this paper results in selection of bioindicators that are accepted by biologists, public health personnel, public-policy makers, resource agencies, regulatory agencies, subsistence hunters/fishers, and a wide range of other stakeholders. The process is applicable to other sites with ecologically important buffer lands or waters, or where contamination issues are contentious. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we advocate the additional inclusion of stakeholders in the refinement of research methods and protocols and in the execution of the research, rather than just at the final communication and reporting phase. We use a large study of potential radionuclide levels in marine biota around Amchitka Island as a case study. Amchitka Island, in the Aleutian Island Chain of Alaska, was the site of three underground nuclear tests (1965-1971). The overall objective of the biological component of the study was to collect a range of marine biota for radionuclide analysis that could provide data for assessing current food safety and provide a baseline for developing a plan to monitor human and ecosystem health in perpetuity. Stakeholders, including regulators (State of Alaska), resource trustees (US Fish and Wildlife Service, State of Alaska), representatives of the Aleut and Pribilof Island communities, the Department of Energy (DOE), and others, were essential for plan development. While these stakeholders were included in the initial problem formulation and approved science plan, we also included them in the refinement of protocols, selection of bioindicators, selection of a reference site, choice of methods of collection, and in the execution of the study itself. Meetings with stakeholders resulted in adding (or deleting) bioindicator species and tissues, prioritizing target species, refining sampling methods, and recruiting collection personnel. Some species were added because they were important subsistence foods for the Aleuts, and others were added because they were ecological equivalents to replace species deleted because of low population numbers. Two major refinements that changed the research thrust were (1) the inclusion of Aleut hunters and fishers on the biological expedition itself to ensure that subsistence foods and methods were represented, and (2) the addition of a fisheries biologist on a NOAA research trawler to allow sampling of commercial fishes. Although the original research design called for the collection of biota by Aleut subsistence fishermen, and by a commercial fishing boat, the research was modified with continued stakeholder input to actually include Aleuts and a fisheries biologist on the expeditions to ensure their representation. The inclusion of stakeholders during the development of protocols and the research itself improved the overall quality of the investigation, while making it more relevant to the interested and affected parties. Final responsibility for the design and execution of the research and radionuclide analysis rested with the researchers, but the process of stakeholder inclusion made the research more valuable as a source of credible information and for public policy decisions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

KCI and the City teamed to pursue a collaborative strategy to complete the work in parallel with environmental restoration efforts in the region. Initial concepts for the dredging and associated material placement were generated and advanced by KCI. At the same time, all necessary background information was compiled for the dredging including a material characteristics assessment, updates to hydrographic surveys, and consultation with VOR yacht design firms to assess controlling parameters. During the preliminary designs, Greenbury Point, owned by the U.S. Naval Academy was identified as a possible location for beneficial use of the dredged material. The Greenbury Point peninsula, located at the mouth of the Severn River, was identified because of its close proximity to Annapolis Harbor and the need for environmental restoration at the site, including stabilization of a potentially failing berm, existing fresh water ponds, and wetlands associated with an historic Dredge Material Placement (DMP) site. Greenbury point also contained opportunities for wetlands creation through dredge material placement utilization and reforestation. The team also recognized that the project could potentially serve as a model for local DMP. Local officials noted that the space availability for DMP sites, especially on the larger scale of regional DMP sites, is continuously being reduced through land development while capacity requirements remain at least stable. Based upon the preliminary designs, the City of Annapolis requested Congressional funding for the project through the Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration portion of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), also known as a Section 206 project. With the background data provided by the team, initial Congressional funding was allocated to the project with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) tasked with completing the work. After choosing several potential scenarios for advancing the project, KCI, Annapolis, and USACE assembled potential shareholders including the Maryland Port Administration (MPA), U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Maryland Environmental Service (MES), and Anne Arundel County Soil Conservation Service to ascertain the potential benefits to the region from the project. By providing positive leadership and direction to the project, team leaders were able to forge a consensus among all partners through a mutually beneficial Collaborative Strategy approach. This Collaborative Strategy sought simply to provide a ""win"" for all involved team members. With a Collaborative Strategy in place, and with a strong interest in providing environmentally beneficial uses of dredged material, MPA agreed to earmark an existing DMP site for disposal of the Annapolis Harbor dredge material in exchange for participation in the Greenbury Point restoration portion of the project. In addition a time-optimized design for the dredging and material placement was produced which allowed the dredging of Annapolis Harbor to be completed in early 2006. During the same period KCI continued Section 206 project development based upon inputs of team members, drafting a Scope of Work and cost estimates for the entire project. This information was used to secure further funding from Congress from which design of the Section 206 portion of the project is currently advancing.

Global trade in ornamental fish from an Australian perspective: The case for revised import risk analysis and management strategies,"Whittington, R.J.; Chong, R.","Over 1 billion ornamental fish comprising more than 4000 freshwater and 1400 marine species are traded internationally each year, with 8-10 million imported into Australia alone. Compared to other commodities, the pathogens and disease translocation risks associated with this pattern of trade have been poorly documented. The aim of this study was to conduct an appraisal of the effectiveness of risk analysis and quarantine controls as they are applied according to the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) agreement in Australia. Ornamental fish originate from about 100 countries and hazards are mostly unknown; since 2000 there have been 16-fold fewer scientific publications on ornamental fish disease compared to farmed fish disease, and 470 fewer compared to disease in terrestrial species (cattle). The import quarantine policies of a range of countries were reviewed and classified as stringent or non-stringent based on the levels of pre-border and border controls. Australia has a stringent policy which includes pre-border health certification and a mandatory quarantine period at border of 1-3 weeks in registered quarantine premises supervised by government quarantine staff. Despite these measures there have been many disease incursions as well as establishment of significant exotic viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoal and metazoan pathogens from ornamental fish in farmed native Australian fish and free-living introduced species. Recent examples include Megalocytivirus and Aeromonas salmonicida atypical strain. In 2006, there were 22 species of alien ornamental fish with established breeding populations in waterways in Australia and freshwater plants and molluscs have also been introduced, proving a direct transmission pathway for establishment of pathogens in native fish species. Australia's stringent quarantine policies for imported ornamental fish are based on import risk analysis under the SPS agreement but have not provided an acceptable level of protection (ALOP) consistent with government objectives to prevent introduction of pests and diseases, promote development of future aquaculture industries or maintain biodiversity. It is concluded that the risk analysis process described by the Office International des Epizooties under the SPS agreement cannot be used in a meaningful way for current patterns of ornamental fish trade. Transboundary disease incursions will continue and exotic pathogens will become established in new regions as a result of the ornamental fish trade, and this will be an international phenomenon. Ornamental fish represent a special case in live animal trade where OIE guidelines for risk analysis need to be revised. Alternatively, for countries such as Australia with implied very high ALOP, the number of species traded and the number of sources permitted need to be dramatically reduced to facilitate hazard identification, risk assessment and import quarantine controls. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Policy responses to IUU fishing in Northern Australian waters,"Vince, J.","Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities continue to thrive in the northern region of Australia's Fishing Zone (AFZ). Indonesian fishermen involved in IUU fishing in this area target specific marine species such as shark, reef fish, sea cucumber and trochus that are destined for the Asian market. Many of these marine species' stocks are now at critical levels. Local communities based in Northern Australia, state and Federal governments are also concerned with issues of border security and quarantine measures that coincide with the IUU fishing activities. Whilst Australian and Indonesian governments continue to negotiate this pressing issue, international instruments, bilateral agreements and domestic policies are not deterring Indonesian fishermen from pursuing IUU fishing activities in the AFZ. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Can cod farming affect cod fishing? A system evaluation of sustainability,"Standal, D.; Bouwer Utne, I.","The cod resources in the Barents Sea constitute the most important fisheries in Norway. In order to reduce resource allocation conflicts among different gear and vessel groups and to ensure profit for all participants throughout the value chain, the sector is thoroughly organized. The institutions established to ensure long-term sustainability, have been developed within the framework of a joint Norwegian-Russian fisheries management regime. However, due to a very high fishing mortality, the cod stock is now under severe pressure. In addition, a major part of the cod fisheries is highly seasonal and unable to be a stable supplier to neither the land-based industry nor demanding international markets. In parallel, cod farming is expected to become a new emerging industry, with potential to copy the success of farmed Atlantic salmon. Many actors within the cod fisheries fear the future competition from the growing cod farming sector. With reference to important attributes that characterize the cod fisheries and cod farming, this paper discusses how a future farming industry may affect the traditional cod fisheries. Moreover, we discuss how the fisheries may be forced to organize in the future to encounter the expected competition from cod farming. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Policy and practice in Myanmar's protected area system,"Myint Aung, U.","Myanmar's protected area (PA) system began nearly 150 years ago under royal patronage. Park policies and practices, embodied in 19 pieces of legislation developed sporadically during and after the colonial period. As a result of the FAO-UNDP's Nature Conservation and National Parks Project (1981-1985) the government established the Nature &amp; Wildlife Conservation Division and placed it within the Forest Department as the agency responsible for PA management. As a consequence the number of parks increased from 14 to 33. Myanmar's median park size is less than 50 km2, but only five parks (15%) are larger than 1000 km2. Most parks conserve terrestrial habitats; parks encompassing inland wetlands, mangrove, and marine habitats are limited in number and size. Existing PAs unequally represent Myanmar's ecosystems; the Malay Transition, Burmese coast, Burmese Transition and Cardamom Mountains bio-units are under-represented within the system. The effective total PA size (i.e., area of all parks less the area of 13 paper parks) is currently about 2.1%. Budgetary support for parks increased 11% since 1996, but is insufficient to address park needs, particularly in remote parks that are understaffed. Limited education and training of PA staff is a major factor limiting effective park management. Fifty-eight percent of park wardens are educated as foresters, and 42% have university degrees. The average posting in a park is 4 years, which is less than ideal for management continuity. Recommended actions to secure Myanmar's PAs include evaluation and reformulation of policies, increasing representation of Myanmar's habitats within the PA system, management planning, and standardizing protocols for anti-poaching patrols and other forms of law enforcement. Improved leadership training for wardens and range forest officers can also improve park management. Funding for community relations and more integrated management of parks and people can reduce conflicts, while environmental education and outreach activities can provide some needed services. Finally, new ways and means are needed to support these activities. Myanmar's PAs need creative and sustainable means of support, including partnerships with non-government organizations to supplement traditional means of support. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Management measures and fishers' commitment to sustainable exploitation: A case study of Atlantic salmon fisheries in the Baltic Sea,"Haapasaari, P.; Michielsens, C.G.J.; Karjalainen, T.P.; Reinikainen, K.; Kuikka, S.","Fisheries management aimed at sustainable exploitation may affect fish populations indirectly by influencing human behaviour. We propose a methodology that includes stakeholders' opinions, perceptions, and resulting behaviour, within assessment models designed to evaluate the impact of different management measures on the stocks. Based on interviews and a questionnaire, we use a Bayesian belief network to examine which factors determine fishers' commitment to sustainable fisheries goals, what impact commitment has on exploitation rate, and what measures can be taken to improve commitment. In addition to exploring alternative management measures, the analysis evaluates knowledge actions (providing information to fishers) and commitment actions (intended to increase trust, consensus, and cooperation). The method is applied in a Baltic Sea case study in which commitment is important for successful recovery of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stocks. The results indicate that the more fishers rely on fishing as their source of income, the less is their commitment and the smaller is the impact of changes in commitment on subsequent catches. The results suggest that commitment can be improved by selecting management measures favoured by fishers and by combining them with commitment and knowledge actions. © 2007 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

"Prevalence of dementia in Chamorros on Guam: Relationship to age, gender, education, and APOE","Galasko, D.; Salmon, D.; Gamst, A.; Olichney, J.; Thal, L.J.; Silbert, L.; Kaye, J.; Brooks, P.; Adonay, R.; Craig, U.-K.; Schellenberg, G.; Borenstein, A.R.","OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of dementia and its clinical subtypes among Chamorros on Guam aged 65 years or older and to examine associations with age, gender, education, and APOE genotype. BACKGROUND: Chamorros, the indigenous people of Guam, had a high incidence of ALS and parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC), in the 1950s. Over the next 50 years, ALS incidence declined markedly, but PDC only slightly. The prevalence of late life dementia in Chamorros and its relationship to ALS/PDC are unknown. METHODS: Island-wide population-based survey of Chamorros aged 65 years or older as of January 1, 2003. Two-stage assessment: cognitive and motor screening, followed by neurologic and psychometric evaluation. Data were reviewed at consensus conference to make clinical diagnoses. RESULTS: Of 2,789 Chamorros aged 65 years or older, 73% were enrolled; 27% declined participation, died before contact or screening, or moved off Guam. The point prevalence of all-cause dementia on February 1, 2004, was 12.2%. Prevalence data for subtypes were as follows: Guam dementia (clinically equivalent to AD), 8.8%; PDC, 1.5%; pure vascular dementia, 1.3%; other, 0.6%. The prevalence of dementia rose exponentially with age. Low education was significantly associated with dementia, but gender was not. There was a trend toward higher PDC prevalence among men. The APOE ε4 allele was not associated with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of dementia among elderly Chamorros is relatively high. Guam dementia is the most common diagnosis and exceeds parkinsonism-dementia complex. Age and low education are strongly associated with dementia, but gender and APOE ε4 are not. Incidence studies will allow risk factors for dementia to be clarified. ©2007AAN Enterprises, Inc.",2007,,Neurology,68,21,1772-1781,,10.1212/01.wnl.0000262028.16738.64,,#21270,Galasko 2007,,
Potency and spectrum of garenoxacin tested against an international collection of skin and soft tissue infection pathogens: report from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program (1999-2004),"Fritsche, T.R.; Sader, H.S.; Jones, R.N.","The spectrum and potency of garenoxacin, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone, against a large international collection (11 723 strains) of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens that cause skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) were evaluated for the years 1999 to 2004. Consecutive nonduplicate bacterial isolates were collected from patients with documented community-acquired or nosocomial SSTI in &gt;70 medical centers participating in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program in North America (37.4%), Europe (26.7%), Latin America (16.7%), and the Asia-Pacific region (19.2%). All isolates were tested using the reference broth microdilution methods against garenoxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and representative comparator agents used for the empiric or directed therapy for SSTI. Ranking pathogens producing SSTI during these years included Staphylococcus aureus (42.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.1%), Escherichia coli (9.0%), Enterococcus spp. (7.3%), Klebsiella spp. (4.8%), Enterobacter spp. (4.7%), β-hemolytic streptococci (4.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (4.0%), Proteus mirabilis (2.5%), and Acinetobacter spp. (2.1%). Garenoxacin was the most potent agent tested against S. aureus and was at least 2-fold more active than gatifloxacin (MIC50, 0.06 mg/L) and 8-fold more active than levofloxacin (MIC50, 0.25 mg/L). Furthermore, garenoxacin was 2- to 8-fold more potent than the fluoroquinolones against β-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, as well as up to 4-fold more active against enterococci. Garenoxacin was largely comparable with the comparator fluoroquinolones against E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Acinetobacter spp., but it is less active than these agents against P. aeruginosa. In summary, garenoxacin was documented to be the most potent quinolone when tested against key Gram-positive pathogens (S. aureus, β-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci) and was similar in activity to these agents against other species (Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp.). These in vitro data suggest that garenoxacin warrants further clinical studies in SSTI, especially against staphylococci and streptococcal pathogens. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Determinants of carotid intima-medial thickness in an urban Australian Aboriginal population,"Bradshaw, P.J.; Wilkes, E.T.; Thompson, P.L.","Introduction: We studied the determinants of carotid atherosclerosis in urban-dwelling Australian Aboriginals at high risk of atherosclerotic mortality and morbidity. Methods: Cross-sectional study of self-selected adult Australian Aboriginals. Participants (n = 602) aged 18-74 years had risk factor assessment and carotid ultrasound to determine carotid intima-medial thickness (IMT) and the presence of plaque. The upper quartile (>0.71 mm in males and >0.62 mm in females) was used as a measure of increased carotid IMT. Results: Over 80% of participants were overweight or obese; the prevalence of diabetes was 25%. Age was the major predictor of thick IMT, OR 3.0 (95% CI 2.0-4.5) per decade for males and OR 6.3 (3.3-12.0) for females. Waist circumference and blood glucose were independent predictors of IMT for men, with hypertension, pack-years of smoking, diabetes, and cholesterol ratio additional predictors for women. Plaque was highly prevalent (>40%) in this relatively young population and was predicted by increasing age, a history of smoking and total cholesterol/HDL ratio, but not sex. Conclusions: Urban-dwelling Aboriginal Australians are at increased risk for early atherosclerosis. In this study an excess of obesity-related cardiovascular risk factors were the important contributors to increased IMT carotid atherosclerosis, but not inflammatory markers or other novel risk factors. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Validation of interlaboratory studies on toxicity in water samples,"Farré, M.; Martínez, E.; Barceló, D.","Toxicity tests are important for assessing the impact of chemicals on aquatic ecosystems because they indicate toxic effects of complex chemical mixtures. Several methods have been developed for rapid assessment of the dangerous biological effects of samples.

However, toxicity tests using different species have shown different sensitivities and endpoints, and only a limited number of tests have been standardized and validated. In order to verify the quality of biological measurements, to estimate the analytical precision of different participating laboratories using the same test, and to determine if statistically significant differences exist between results of participating laboratories, different interlaboratory exercises have been carried out.

C-reactive protein and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in Aboriginal Australians,"Wang, Z.; Hoy, W.E.","Objective: To investigate the association between C-reactive protein (CRP) and the risk of developing diabetes in Aboriginal Australians. Research design and methods: High sensitivity CRP levels were measured in 620 Aboriginal participants aged 20-74 years free from diabetes at baseline in a remote community in the Northern Territory of Australia. Participants were followed for a median of 11 years to identify newly diagnosed cases of diabetes. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the relationship of CRP levels with the risk of developing diabetes over the follow-up period. Results: A total of 109 participants were newly diagnosed with diabetes. Incident rates were 10.8, 16.6 and 28.8 per 1000 person-years for people in the lower, middle and upper tertile groups of baseline CRP levels, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, baseline glucose regulation status, total cholesterol, urine albumin to creatinine ratio, systolic blood pressure, smoking and alcohol drinking, the association between diabetes and CRP remained significant, with a hazard ratio of 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05, 1.45) corresponding to a doubling in CRP values. Similarly, the adjusted hazard ratio for development of diabetes in people in the upper tertile versus the bottom two tertiles of CRP was 1.75 (95% CI 1.19, 2.56). Conclusions: CRP is independently associated with the development of diabetes in Aboriginal people.

Achieving sustainability of community-based dengue control in Santiago de Cuba,"Toledo Romani, M.E.; Vanlerberghe, V.; Perez, D.; Lefevre, P.; Ceballos, E.; Bandera, D.; Baly Gil, A.; Van der Stuyft, P.","Achieving sustainability is one of the major current challenges in disease control programmes. In 2001-2002, a community-based dengue control intervention was developed in three health zones of Santiago de Cuba. New structures (heterogeneous community working groups and provincial/municipal coordination groups inserted in the vertical programme) were formed and constituted a key element to achieve social mobilization. In three control zones, routine programme activities were intensified. We evaluated the sustainability of the intervention strategy over a period of 2 years after the withdrawal of external support. Data on maintenance of effects, level of institutionalization and continuity of activities through capacity building were collected via documental review, direct observation, questionnaires, key informant and group interviews and routine entomological surveys. The intervention effects, evaluated through larval indices and behavioural change indicators, were maintained during the 2 years of follow-up. In the intervention area, 87.5% of the water storage containers remained well covered in 2004 and 90.5% of the families continued to correctly use a larvicide, against 21.5% and 63.5%, respectively in the control area. The house indices further declined from 0.35% in 2002 to 0.17% in 2004 in the intervention area, while in the control area they increased from 0.52% to 2.25%. Institutionalization of the intervention, assessed in terms of degrees of intensiveness (passage, routine, niche saturation), was reaching saturation by the end of the study. Key elements of the intervention had lost their separate identity and became part of the control programme's regular activities. The host organization adapted its structures and procedures accordingly. Continuous capacity building in the community led to participatory planning, implementation and evaluation of the Aedes control activities. It is concluded that, in contrast to intensified routine control activities, a community-based intervention approach promises to be sustainable. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Influence of the sample toxic profile on the suitability of a high performance liquid chromatography method for official paralytic shellfish toxins control,"Ben-Gigirey, B.; Rodríguez-Velasco, M.L.; Villar-González, A.; Botana, L.M.","An HPLC-FLD method, involving pre-chromatographic oxidation of the PSP toxins with hydrogen peroxide and periodate, has been AOAC validated through a collaborative trial and adopted as AOAC Official Method. This method could be a candidate for replacing the mouse bioassay (MBA) for the Official Control of PSP toxins at European level, once accepted by the legislation. An interlaboratory exercise has been organized by the CRLMB to evaluate its ""fitness for purpose"" for the Official Control of PSP toxins in the EU laboratories. Eighteen EU laboratories took part in the study and had to analyze six bivalve mollusc samples with several PSP toxic profiles. The performance of the participant laboratories in the application of this method was compared with that obtained at the collaborative trial. Information on problems/drawbacks encountered by participants in the application of this method was also sought. The HPLC validated method is only applicable for Official PSP Control for certain samples. This depends on sample PSP toxic profile. Results obtained for samples where only GTX2,3 and STX were present were satisfactory and in agreement with MBA results. Results obtained for a sample with a toxic profile dominated by GTX6 and suspected to contain also C1,2 and C3,4 were not satisfactory. GTX5 and dc-STX could be quantified, although the results achieved (total toxicity) were lower than those obtained by MBA. It can be also useful as a screening method, complementary to MBA, helping in the reduction of the animals used. However, the lack of several PSP standards, the fact that the method is not validated for all the PSP toxins, and several drawbacks found in its application are a handicap to fully implement it for Official PSP Control as a viable replacement for bioassay. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To that effect, concrete specimens (with and without reinforcement) were prepared for electrochemical and physical/mechanical/chemical tests using the existing materials in each participating country, following strict procedures which enabled the preparation of similar concrete samples. Two water/cement (w/c) ratios (0.45 and 0.65) were selected, where the concrete with 0.45 w/c ratio had to have a minimum cement content of 400 kg/m3 and the one with 0.65 w/c ratio a compressive strength of 210 kg/cm2. Type I Portland cement, siliceous sand, and crushed rock as coarse aggregates (13-mm maximum nominal size) were used. After a one-year exposure, the results of the corrosion potentiality and probability analysis of the reinforcement in the different test stations showed that, for marine atmospheres, the most aggressive environment to induce steel corrosion was at Portugal's Cabo Raso station, and the least aggressive one was at Chile's Valparaíso station. These results are comparable with the ones found using electrochemical measurements, after a two-year exposure. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Developing a saltmarsh classification tool for the European water framework directive,"Best, M.; Massey, A.; Prior, A.","The Water Framework Directive (WFD) identifies marine angiosperms (seagrasses and saltmarshes) as one of the biological elements used to classify water body status. This paper concentrates on the saltmarsh classification tools currently under development in the UK and RoI by the Marine Plants Task Team (MPTT) of the UK Technical Advisory Group (UK TAG). Saltmarsh classification is presently focusing on habitat extent, zonation and species diversity in order to fulfil the requirements of the WFD normative definitions. One of the many issues is that the natural rates of erosion and/or accretion differ between locations - this spatial and temporal natural variation is difficult to quantify; the tools and reference conditions developed will need to take this into consideration. To accurately quantify the classification boundaries and natural variability has posed a number of challenges; possible solutions are identified in this paper. Novel future classifications may also include saltmarsh ecosystem functioning (e.g., as a marine fish nursery) which may be further developed in an integrated saltmarsh tool. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Dissolved oxygen as a physico-chemical supporting element in the Water Framework Directive,"Best, M.A.; Wither, A.W.; Coates, S.","For transitional and coastal waters the Water Framework Directive identifies 5 ""General chemical and physiochemical elements supporting the biological elements"". The five elements are transparency, thermal conditions, oxygenation conditions, salinity and nutrient conditions. ""Supporting"" in the context of the directive means that the values of the physicochemical quality elements are such as to support a biological community of a certain ecological status, recognising the fact that biological communities are products of their physical and chemical environment. Physicochemical and hydromophological aspects fundamentally determine the type of water body and habitat, and hence the type specific biological community. The directive does not intended that these supporting elements should be used as surrogates for the biological elements in monitoring. The monitoring and assessment of the physical and physicochemical quality elements will support the interpretation, assessment and classification of the results arising from the monitoring of the biological quality elements. This paper considers the challenges involved in the development of oxygen standards for the directive, their relationship to the biological elements and normative conditions of the directive and to regulatory requirements. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A new methodology based on littoral community cartography dominated by macroalgae for the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive,"Ballesteros, E.; Torras, X.; Pinedo, S.; García, M.; Mangialajo, L.; de Torres, M.","Macroalgae is a biological key element for the assessment of the ecological status in coastal waters in the frame of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000/60/EC). Here we propose a methodology for monitoring water quality based on the cartography of littoral and upper-sublittoral rocky-shore communities (CARLIT, in short). With the use of spatial databases, GIS, and available information about the value of rocky-shore communities as indicators of water quality, it is possible to obtain an environmental quality index representative of the ecological status of rocky coasts. This index, which completely fulfils the requirements of the WFD, is expressed as a ratio between the observed values in the sector of shore that is being assessed and the expected value in a reference condition zone with the same substrate and coastal morphology (Ecological Quality Ratio, EQR).

Establishing boundary classes for the classification of UK marine waters using phytoplankton communities,"Devlin, M.; Best, M.; Coates, D.; Bresnan, E.; O'Boyle, S.; Park, R.; Silke, J.; Cusack, C.; Skeats, J.","This paper presents a description of three of the proposed phytoplankton indices under investigation as part of a classification framework for UK and ROI marine waters. The three indices proposed for the classification process are (i) phytoplankton biomass measured as chlorophyll, (ii) the frequency of elevated phytoplankton counts measuring individual species and total cell counts and (iii) Seasonal progression of phytoplankton functional groups through the year. Phytoplankton biomass is calculated by a 90th percentile measurement of chlorophyll over the growing season (April to September) compared to a predetermined reference value. Calculation of functional groups and cell counts are taken as proportional counts derived from the presence of the indicator species or group as compared to the total phytoplankton count. Initial boundary conditions for the assessment of high/good status were tested for each index. Chlorophyll reference conditions were taken from thresholds developed for previous EU directives with the setting of offshore concentrations as a reference condition. Thresholds for elevated counts of phytoplankton taxa were taken from previous EU assessments describing counts that could be impact negatively on the environment. Reference seasonal growth curves are established using phytoplankton counts from ""high status"" waterbodies. To test the preliminary boundaries for each index, a risk assessment integrating nutrient enrichment and susceptibility for coastal and transitional waters was carried out to identify WFD waterbodies in England and Wales at different levels of risk. Waterbodies assessed as having low or medium risk from nutrient enrichment were identified as type 1 and type 2 waterbodies, and waterbodies assessed as high risk were identified as type 3 waterbodies. Phytoplankton data was extracted from the risk assigned waterbodies and applied to each phytoplankton index to test the robustness of the preliminary classification ranges for each phytoplankton index. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Efficacy of a multi-metric fish index as an analysis tool for the transitional fish component of the Water Framework Directive,"Coates, S.; Waugh, A.; Anwar, A.; Robson, M.","The WFD has introduced an international commitment to assess the ecological status of transitional waters (TWs), within which fish communities are a key biological monitoring component. The Transitional Fish Classification Index (TFCI) outlined in this paper uses 10 ecological measures to analyse fish populations caught from various ecological niches using a variety of gear types within the Thames estuary. These reach and method-specific communities are then compared to a reference population created from a 'healthy' population from TWs of a similar type. The results indicate a progressive downstream increase the quality of fish communities, consistent with previous work; variation between methods can be accounted for by gear selectivity.

The WFD requires Member States (MSs) to assess the Ecological Status (ES) of water bodies. This assessment will be based upon the status of the biological, hydromorphological and physico-chemical quality elements, by comparing data obtained from monitoring networks to reference (undisturbed) conditions, and then deriving an Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR). One of the biological quality elements to be considered is the benthic invertebrate component and some structural parameters (composition, diversity and disturbance-sensitive taxa) must be included in the ES assessment. Following these criteria, several approaches to benthic invertebrate assessment have been proposed by MSs. The WFD requires that these approaches are intercalibrated. This contribution describes the comparison of the different methodologies proposed by United Kingdom, Spain, Denmark and Norway.

Founded on quantitative measurements of these attributes, a set of metrics has been developed for monitoring and assessment of the only truly marine angiosperms, seagrass.

Benthic biodiversity indices versus salinity gradient in the southern Baltic Sea,"Zettler, M.L.; Schiedek, D.; Bobertz, B.","The need to assess the environmental status of marine and coastal waters according to the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) encouraged the design of specific biotic indices to evaluate the response of benthic communities to human-induced changes in water quality. In the present study three of these indices, the traditional Shannon Wiener Index (H′) and the more recently published AMBI (AZTI′ Marine Biotic Index) and BQI (Benthic Quality Index), were tested along a salinity gradient in the southern Baltic Sea. The comparison of the three indices demonstrates that in the southern Baltic Sea the ecological quality (EcoQ) classification based on macrozoobenthic communities as indicator greatly depends on the biotic index chosen. We found a significant positive relation between species number, H′, BQI and salinity resulting in EcoQ status of ""Bad"", ""Poor"" or ""Moderate"" in areas with a salinity value below 10 psu. The AMBI was less dependent on salinity but appear to partly overestimate the EcoQ status. Presently none of these biotic indices appear to be adjusted for application in a gradient system as given in the southern Baltic Sea.

The ecological quality status of the Bay of Seine and the Seine estuary: Use of biotic indices,"Dauvin, J.-C.; Ruellet, T.; Desroy, N.; Janson, A.-L.","Using recent indices developed, in part, for use under the European Water Framework Directive (AMBI, BENTIX, BOPA, BQI, I2EC and the trophic index ITI), the ecological quality status of two highly contaminated environments-the Bay of Seine and the Seine estuary (Eastern English Channel)-was determined on several spatial and temporal scales. Data from 604 observations gathered over a 14-year period (1988-2002) were analyzed, and the results used to show the relationship between biotic indices, environmental variables and classic descriptors (e.g., number of species, total abundance, dominance index, ES(50) and Shannon/Brillouin diversities). Though the specific ecological quality (EcoQ) values calculated with the various indices were different, the overall trend of the results was similar. Synthesizing the values produced by the six indices used in the study allowed attribution of a high to good EcoQ status to the Bay of Seine and a moderate EcoQ to the estuary.

"Paradox of estuarine quality: Benthic indicators and indices, consensus or debate for the future","Dauvin, J.-C.","The European Water Framework Directive will have instituted the concept of Ecological Quality Status (EQS) as a way to assess the biological quality of water masses. The EQS will be based mainly upon the composition of the different biological compartments in the ecosystem specially the benthos as compared to certain reference sites. Such management tools are already well established for freshwater (i.e. biotic indices), but not for coastal and estuarine (i.e. transitional) waters. In the framework of the Seine-Aval programme a workshop on benthic indicators was organized at Wimereux (France) in June 2005. The aim of this workshop and this paper is (1) to present the experiences of the Seine Aval researchers, and the French scientific approaches to benthic indicators, with those international experiences and approaches that have been published or are under development; and (2) to examine the existing benthic tools and their possible use in the characterization of the state of estuarine ecosystems. The debate during the workshop and the numerous recently published on the WFD are discussed in term of the implementation of the WFD in transitional water bodies using benthic indicators and indices.

Defining and detecting undesirable disturbance in the context of marine eutrophication,"Tett, P.; Gowen, R.; Mills, D.; Fernandes, T.; Gilpin, L.; Huxham, M.; Kennington, K.; Read, P.; Service, M.; Wilkinson, M.; Malcolm, S.","An understanding of undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms is needed to diagnose marine eutrophication as defined by EU Directives and OSPAR. This review summarizes the findings of the UK Defra-funded Undesirable Disturbance Study Team, which concluded that 'an undesirable disturbance is a perturbation of a marine ecosystem that appreciably degrades the health or threatens the sustainable human use of that ecosystem'. A methodology is proposed for detecting disturbance of temperate salt-water communities dominated by phytoplanktonic or phytobenthic primary producers. It relies on monitoring indicators of ecosystem structure and vigour, which are components of health. Undesirable disturbance can be diagnosed by accumulating evidence of ecohydrodynamic type-specific changes in: (i) bulk indicators; (ii) frequency statistics; (iii) flux measurements; (iv) structural indicators; and (v) indicator species. These are exemplified by (i) chlorophyll, transparency, dissolved oxygen, and opportunistic seaweed cover; (ii) HABs frequency; (iii) primary production; (iv) benthic and planktonic 'trophic indices'; (v) seagrasses and Nephrops norvegicus. Ecological Quality Objectives are proposed for some of these. Linking the diagnosis to eutrophication requires correlation of changes with nutrient enrichment. The methodology, which requires the development of a plankton community index and emphasizes the importance of primary production as an indicator of vigour, can be harmonized with the EU Water Framework Directive and OSPAR's Strategy to Combat Eutrophication. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Polychaete/amphipod ratio revisited,"Dauvin, J.C.; Ruellet, T.","In this paper, we reexamine the opportunistic polychaete/amphipod ratio, modifying it to allow estuarine and coastal communities to be divided into the five classes suggested by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The resulting biological index, called the BOPA index, considers the total number of individuals collected in the samples, the frequency of opportunistic polychaetes, and the frequency of amphipods (except the genus Jassa). After comparing this new index to AMBI and BENTIX, two other indices that have been proposed in the literature, we tested it in two situations involving soft-bottom communities in the English Channel (Bay of Morlaix and Bay of Seine). Our results show that the BOPA index is simple to use. Amphipods and opportunistic polychaetes (21 species, nine genus and two families from the AZTI list for a total of 3459 taxa) are easy to identify, providing that both the number of these organisms in a sample and the total number of individuals collected (independent of the sampling surface) is known. The BOPA is appropriate for use in the poorest communities whose total number of individuals exceeds 20 individuals. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Standard procedures for the determination and assessment of noise impact on sea life by offshore wind farms,"Elmer, K.-H.; Gerasch, W.-J.; Neumann, T.; Gabriel, J.; Betke, K.; Matuschek, R.; Schultz-Von Glahn, M.","Offshore wind energy is a new technology created by the merging of classical wind energy technology and classical offshore technology. Wind speeds are considerably higher over the sea as compared to onshore sites, but also the cost per installed kW will increase when moving offshore. The rapid development of wind energy use in Germany is accompanied by an increase of the installed power per wind turbine. In the German areas of the North and Baltic Seas, several large offshore wind farms are planned; each with several hundreds turbines of up to 5 MW each. The Institute for Structural Analysis (ISD) of the University of Hannover, the German Wind Energy Institute (DEWI) in Wilhelmshaven, and the Institute for Technical and Applied Physics (itap) in Oldenburg are partners in a project on: Standard Procedures for the Determination and Assessment of Noise Impact on Sea Life by Offshore Wind Farms which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Environment (BMU). The aim of this project (CRI, DEWI, itap 2004) is to study the generation, radiation and attenuation of underwater noise, to develop forecasting hydro sound models of offshore wind converters and future noise reduction methods during pile driving, to determine the impact area of offshore wind farms, to allow the formulation of recommendations for acoustic emission thresholds for offshore wind farms in cooperation with biologists, and to develop standard procedures for the determination and assessment of noise emissions. The operation and in particular the construction of offshore wind converters induce considerable underwater noise emissions. It is assumed that small whales and seals can be affected by noises from machines and vessels, piling and installation of the wind turbines. Piling, in particular using hydraulic hammers creates high frequency noise with considerable sound power levels. Currently, only little knowledge about the effects of different noises to marine life is available. With a view to determining the effects on the marine flora and fauna and structural design aspects, the research platform FINO 1 (Fig. 1) was erected in the North Sea. Measurements of the underwater noise during construction of offshore research platforms and numerical investigations are used to develop future forecasting hydro sound models of offshore wind converters. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

Transboundary seabird conservation in an important North American marine ecoregion,"Wolf, S.; Keitt, B.; Aguirre-Muñoz, A.; Tershy, B.; Palacios, E.; Croll, D.","Many seabird species of conservation concern have large geographic ranges that span political borders, forcing conservation planners to facilitate their protection in multiple countries. Seabird conservation planning within the seabird-diverse California Current System (CCS) marine ecoregion presents an important opportunity for transboundary collaborations to better protect seabirds across the USA/México border. While seabird populations in the USA are relatively well-studied and well-protected, the status of seabird populations in the Mexican region of the CCS is not well known and seabird colonies have been virtually unprotected. This study synthesizes and supplements information on breeding seabird diversity and distribution, identifies and ranks threats to seabirds and evaluates conservation capacity in the Mexican CCS to provide a framework for transboundary seabird conservation throughout the CCS ecoregion. Island-breeding seabirds in México support 43-57% of CCS breeding individuals, 59% of CCS breeding taxa and a high level of endemism. Connectivity between populations in México and the USA is high. At least 17 of the 22 extant Mexican CCS breeding seabirds are USA/México transboundary breeders or foragers, 13 of which are federally listed in the USA or México. Introduced predators and human disturbance have caused multiple seabird population extirpations in the Mexican CCS because breeding colonies lack legal protection or enforcement. However, conservation capacity in this region has increased rapidly in recent years through the establishment of new protected areas, growth of local conservation non-governmental organizations, and increase in local community support, all of which will allow for more effective use of conservation funds. Transboundary conservation coordination would better protect CCS seabirds by facilitating restoration of seabird colonies in the Mexican CCS and enabling an ecoregion-wide prioritization of seabird conservation targets to direct funding bodies to the most cost-effective investments. © 2006 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.",2006,,Environmental Conservation,33,4,294-305,,10.1017/S0376892906003353,,#21314,Wolf 2006,,

Design: A survey study of men starting military training between June 11, 2002, and April 5, 2006. Multivariate logistic regression models compared risky drinkers with ""all others"" or with nonrisky drinkers; excluding nondrinkers. Setting: Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, Calif. Participants: Forty-one thousand four hundred eightytwo men aged 18 to 20 years. Main Exposures: Age at drinking onset; childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse; childhood emotional and physical neglect; and household alcohol abuse, mental illness, domestic violence, or divorce. Main Outcome Measures: Risky drinking identified by scoring responses to 3 questions about alcohol consumption. Results: Of 41 482 young men, 6128 (14.8%) were identified as risky drinkers, 18 693 (45.1%) as nonrisky drinkers, and 16 661 (40.2%) as nondrinkers. Among drinkers, early initiation of alcohol use was strongly associated with risky drinking, with a 5.5-fold risk if age at onset of drinking was 13 years or younger. Other associated factors included tobacco use, rural or small hometown, higher education, motivation to join the military for travel or adventure or to leave problems at home, numerous close friends and relatives, household alcohol abuse or mental illness, and childhood sexual or emotional abuse. When the comparison group included nondrinkers, additional associated factors included childhood physical abuse and domestic violence. Conclusions: These analyses confirm previous findings on risks for alcohol misuse in young adults and quantify these risks in new, large, multivariable models, adding unique perspective from a population of young Marines.

Challenges to global surveillance of disease patterns,"Todd, E.C.D.","Surveillance systems for foodborne disease vary in capacity by country, especially for marine-related illnesses. Generally, the more developed the country is, the more funding that is put into its surveillance programs, but no country has an outstanding system that could serve as a model for all others. An additional problem is lack of consistency. Approaches to surveillance and available resources change over time, so that apparent trends may reflect more of an administrative function. Most countries have some passive system that allows data on foodborne illnesses to be sent to centralized authorities where summaries are generated. However, these depend on the uneven quality of the source data that vary according to the resources allocated at the local level. Active surveillance systems collect data targeted to answer specific epidemiological questions more efficiently, but at such a high cost that most countries do not have the resources, except on a occasional basis. There is also the issue of what to do with the collected data. There has to be a conscious effort to translate the problems identified from the surveillance programs to consider strategies for prevention and control of foodborne disease. Otherwise, there is little value in having these kinds of monitoring programs. Another problem is lack of coordination in surveillance systems between most countries, so that information can be rapidly and efficiently shared. That being said, surveillance over the years had generated much interesting information on how disease agents are transmitted through the food supply, and where contamination and growth by pathogens in the food production and preparation chain typically occur. In addition, attempts are being made to create regional networks in different parts of the world usually initiated by organizations like WHO and PAHO. The kinds of information collected and programs being introduced are discussed in examples taken from both the developed and less developed world, followed by a series of recommendations for improving surveillance on a global basis. A recent burden in the surveillance system is the potential for a deliberate attack on the food supply with agents not usually involved with foodborne illness. At least in the US, a major concern is for the rapid detection and containment of a massive contamination of the food supply. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Sex and location (Samoa and American Samoa) specific multivariable logistic regression models were used to test for relationships between SES and CVD risk factors at baseline after adjustment for age and the other SES indicators. In addition an ordinal SES index was constructed for each individual based on all three SES indicators, and used in a multivariable model to estimate the predicted probability of CVD risk factors across the SES index for the two locations. In both the models using specific SES measures and CVD risk factor outcomes, and the models using the ordinal SES index and predicted probabilities of CVD risk factors, we detected a pattern of high SES associated with: (1) elevated odds of CVD risk factors in less developed Samoa, and (2) decreased odds of CVD risk factors in more developed American Samoa. We conclude that the pattern of inverse associations between SES and CVD risk factors in Samoa and direct associations in American Samoa is attributable to the heterogeneity across the Samoas in specific exposures to social processes of economic development and the natural history of individual CVD risk factors. The findings suggest that interventions on non-communicable diseases in the Samoas must be devised based on the level of economic development, the socio-economic context of risk factor exposures, and individual characteristics such as age, sex and education level. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Oil well produced water discharges to the North Sea. Part II: Comparison of deployed mussels (Mytilus edulis) and the DREAM model to predict ecological risk,"Neff, J.M.; Johnsen, S.; Frost, T.K.; Røe Utvik, T.I.; Durell, G.S.","Large volumes of water often are produced with oil and gas from offshore platforms. The produced water is separated from the oil and gas and either reinjected into a deep formation or discharged to the ocean. The Norwegian oil and gas industry advocates ecological risk assessment as the basis for managing produced water discharges to the North Sea. In this paper, we compare estimates of ecological risks to water-column communities based on data on hydrocarbon residues in soft tissues of blue mussels deployed for a month near offshore platforms and based on predictions of the Dose related Risk and Effect Assessment Model (DREAM). The study was performed near produced water discharges to the Tampen and Ekofisk Regions of the Norwegian Sector of the North Sea. Because polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are considered the most important contributors to the ecological hazard posed by produced water discharges, comparisons made here focus on this group of compounds. The mussel approach is based on predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of individual PAH, estimated from PAH residues in mussels following deployment for a month near several produced water discharges, and predicted no effects concentrations (PNECs) based on a Kow regression model. In the DREAM method, PECs for three PAH fractions are estimated in the three-dimensional area around produced water discharge with the DREAM model. PNECs for each fraction are based on the chronic toxicity of a representative PAH from each fraction divided by an assessment factor to account for uncertainty in the chronic value. The mussel method gives much lower estimates of ecological risk than the DREAM method. The differences are caused by the much lower PNECs used in DREAM than derived from the regression model, and by the lower concentrations of aqueous PAH predicted by DREAM than estimated from PAH residues in mussel tissues. However, the two methods rank stations at different distances from produced water discharges in the same order and both identify 2- and 3-ring PAHs as the main contributors to the ecological risk of produced water discharges. Neither method identifies a significant ecological risk of PAH in the upper water column of the oil fields. The DREAM model may produce an overly conservative estimate of ecological risk of produced water discharges to the North Sea. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The contribution of space radar altimetry to ocean monitoring,"Murat, D.; Faye, S.C.; Escudier, P.; Richard, J.","A significant proportion of world economic and social activities depend on the sea. These activities are subject to uncertainty, loss of efficiency, and direct costs and damage caused by the varying impact and hostility of the marine environment. To mitigate such adverse effects and to ensure a sustainable, cooperative relationship with the marine environment, an accurate description and reliable prediction of ocean variations, as well as an improved scientific understanding of factors controlling these changes, are crucial. Altimetric data from space is a key contributor to these requirements, as well as to understanding global warming. © 05 2006 Alcatel.

These results show the potentiality and probability of future reinforcement corrosion, depending on the type of mixture and the environment to which the structure is exposed. To that effect, concrete specimens, with and without reinforcement, were prepared for electrochemical and physical/mechanical/chemical testing using the existing materials in each participating country, following premises that enabled the preparation of similar concrete specimens. Two water/cement ratios (0.45 and 0.65) were selected, where the concrete with w/c = 0.45 had to have a minimum cement content of 400 kg m-3, and the other with w/c = 0.65, a minimum compressive strength of 21 MPa. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), crushed coarse aggregate, and silica sand were used for concrete preparation. The specimens were exposed to several microenvironments including urban and marine conditions (at least two testing sites in each country), resulting into a total of 46 test sites distributed among 11 countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Spain, Uruguay, Portugal, and Venezuela). The environment was evaluated using ISO Standard 9223 and the concrete was characterized by measuring compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, total and effective porosity, and rapid chloride permeability according to ASTM standards, as well as resistance to water absorption, using the Fagerlund method. After 1-year exposure, some results of the corrosion potentiality and probability analysis of the reinforcement in several test sites based on environmental meteorochemical parameters show that, for specific microclimates like those in marine atmospheres, the most aggressive environment is that at Cabo Raso test site in Portugal, inducing the greater steel-corrosion probability. The least aggressive is the one at Valparaíso in Chile. It was also determined that Maracaibo, Venezuela, is the one that has the greatest probability of early rebar corrosion initiation by carbonation, with the test site at Cali, Colombia being the one that would induce the least corrosion probability. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Public perception of development issues: Public awareness can contribute to sustainable development of a small island,"Tran, K.C.","Many development projects are undertaken in communities where the local inhabitants have little or no input to the planning and implementation of such projects. Encouraging the active participation of local communities in development projects, through capacity-building and environmental education, has become a major objective of sound development programmes. We have successfully included the local community of Holbox Island, Quintana Roo State, Mexico in our programme for long-term monitoring of coastal pollution in and around their Island. Here we report the progress made by different sectors of the Holbox community over a four-year period during which they have become increasingly responsible for the scientific and technical aspects of assessing water quality. A face-to-face, structured survey was used to evaluate attitudes and perceptions with regard to coastal water pollution and other development issues that concern the Holbox Island community. People in Holbox identified coastal pollution, coastal erosion and garbage dumping as major environmental concerns and have acquired a good level of awareness about the causes and consequences of these issues. Our results also indicate that the public has an improved understanding of the interrelationship between their own behaviour, and that of others, and these environmental issues. Our contribution in the Holbox Island has made a positive step towards providing the local community with essential knowledge regarding environmental, development and social issues, thereby enabling them to become actively involved in the environmental conservation of their island. Continuing efforts in capacity-building and environmental education aim to provide the local community with the knowledge and skills that are necessary for making appropriate choices for the preservation and development of Holbox and the surrounding ecosystems. In the long term, the local community will not only be able to contribute directly to on-going development projects, but will also be in a better position to participate with government agencies in the decision-making process. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Floods and Tsunamis,"Llewellyn, M.","The CDC provides the following review and summary of the health effects of tsunamis [46]:. Immediate health concerns: •After the rescue of survivors, the primary public health concerns are clean drinking water, food, shelter, and medical care for injuries.•Flood waters can pose health risks such as contaminated water and food supplies.•Loss of shelter leaves people vulnerable to insect exposure, heat, and other environmental hazards.•Most deaths associated with tsunamis are related to drownings, but traumatic injuries are also a primary concern. Injuries such as broken limbs and head injuries are caused by the physical impact of people being washed into debris, such as houses, trees, and other stationary items. As the water recedes, the strong suction of debris being pulled into large populated areas can further cause injuries and undermine buildings and services.•Medical care is critical in areas where little medical care exists. Secondary effects: •Natural disasters do not necessarily cause an increase in infectious disease outbreaks. However, contaminated water and food supplies and the lack of shelter and medical care may have a secondary effect of worsening illnesses that already exist in the affected region.•Decaying bodies create very little risk for major disease outbreaks.•The people most at risk are those who handle the bodies or prepare them for burial. Long-lasting effects: The effects of a disaster are long-lasting. In the months after a disaster, a greater need exists for financial and material assistance, including•Surveying and monitoring for infectious and water- or insect-transmitted diseases•Diverting medical supplies from nonaffected areas to meet the needs of the affected regions•Restoring normal primary health services, water systems, housing, and employment•Helping the community recover mentally and socially after the crisis has subsided. One sad and unusual statistic from the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster is that many more women than men were killed. Another sad fact is that the number of children killed was disproportionately high. The mental health needs of the victims must be addressed. Addressing these psychologic needs, De Jong and colleagues [47] wrote: ""In Banda Aceh we found that most people have a strong desire to move forward and to rebuild their lives."" The crew on the Mercy observed great resiliency and strength in the Acehnese people. Although most people exposed to a disaster do well and only have transient symptoms, some individuals develop psychiatric illnesses [48]. Post-traumatic stress disorder clearly increases in the disaster-affected areas. Table 7 provides a comparison of the consequences of various disasters, including floods and tsunamis. Earthquakes cause many injuries. The working rule of thumb is to calculate three injuries for every death. Floods and tsunamis, on the other hand, do not typically cause a large number of injuries compared with deaths. This observation of 25 years ago is still valid today. For the United States to have been part of the international humanitarian response to the 2004 tsunami disasters was an honor and a privilege. The cooperation and coordination that occurred, though it may not have been perfect, gives reason to be optimistic about the future, for the world is truly a much smaller place than it used to be and the future depends on communication and mutual respect. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Over-representation of Maori New Zealanders among adolescents in a schizotypy taxon,"Linscott, R.J.; Marie, D.; Arnott, K.L.; Clarke, B.L.","Background: Minority ethnic and migrant groups are often over-represented among those with schizophrenia. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine whether Maori, the aboriginal minority of New Zealand, are over-represented in a schizotypy taxon derived from a general population sample of adolescents. Method: Secondary school students (n = 387) aged 13 to 17 years completed self-report measures of four schizotypy attributes, magical thinking, hallucinatory tendency, self-referential ideation, and perceptual aberration, and indicated ethnic descent and self-identified ethnic belonging. Results: Taxometric analyses (maximum covariance, maximum eigenvalue, latent modes) yielded consistent evidence of taxonicity of schizotypy. Participants who were of Maori descent were over-represented in the schizotypy group. Conclusions: Ethnicity, or the stress and resilience factors for which ethnicity is a proxy measure, has a measurable impact on psychometric risk for schizophrenia. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The contemporary Latin America and the Caribbean zinc cycle: One year stocks and flows,"Harper, E.M.; Bertram, M.; Graedel, T.E.","Contemporary 1994 zinc cycles for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) were characterized by material flow analysis and were completed on regional and country levels. The countries important for the analysis were Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela. Zinc was analyzed within the framework of four life stages in which an anthropogenically utilized material participates - Production, Fabrication and Manufacturing, Use, and Waste Management. Flows among, trade associated with, and changes in stock (where appropriate) corresponding to each life stage were evaluated. Zinc is mined in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru, with Peru conducting the majority of the mining activity. The LAC region is a net exporter of mined zinc concentrate (465 Gg Zn) and refined zinc slab (57 Gg Zn), with Peru as the sole exporter of zinc concentrate and the largest exporter of zinc slab. Most countries import zinc in semi-finished and finished products, with the exceptions being Peru exporting zinc in semi-finished products and Brazil exporting zinc in finished products. In all cases, there is a net addition of zinc to stock in Use, with 190 Gg Zn added to stock in the LAC region. On a regional level, the largest flow of zinc entering Waste Management is from Use (95 Gg Zn), with the key contributors being municipal solid waste (including construction & demolition debris) (45 Gg Zn) and end-of-life vehicles (49 Gg Zn). Zinc entering landfills was estimated at 62 Gg Zn for the LAC region, with the largest contributors being Brazil (35 Gg Zn), Peru (9 Gg Zn) and Argentina (8 Gg Zn). © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Comparing the use of indigenous knowledge with classification and ordination techniques for assessing the species composition and structure of vegetation in a tropical forest,"Hernandez-Stefanoni, J.L.; Pineda, J.B.; Valdes-Valadez, G.","Dentification of groups that are similar in their floristic composition and structure (habitat types) is essential for conservation and forest managers to allocate high priority areas and to designate areas for reserves, refuges, and other protected areas. In this study, the use of indigenous knowledge for the identification of habitat types in the field was compared against an ecological characterization of habitat types, including their species composition obtained by using classification and ordination techniques for a tropical landscape mosaic in a rural Mayan area of Quintana Roo, Mexico. Plant diversity data calculated from 141 sampled sites chosen randomly on a vegetation class's thematic map obtained by multispectral satellite image classification were used for this propose. Results indicated high similarity in the categorization of vegetation types between the Mayan classification and those obtained by cluster and detrended correspondence analysis. This suggests that indigenous knowledge has a practical use and can be comparable to that obtained by using science-based methods. Finally, identification and mapping of vegetation classes (habitat types) using satellite image classification allowed us to discriminate significantly different species compositions, in such a way that they can provide a useful mechanism for interpolating diversity values over the entire landscape. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",2006,,Environmental Management,37,5,686-702,,10.1007/s00267-004-0371-8,,#21341,Hernandez-Stefanoni 2006,,
Towards a market-oriented management model for straddling fish stocks,"Trondsen, T.; Matthiasson, T.; Young, J.A.","Management of straddling fish stocks has been noted for its political complexity. Negotiations frequently falter as each party seeks to focus upon their own individual and shorter-term goals than the collective interest of the sector. Entrenched positions are often only deepened as new entrants participate to establish their own claims to any emergent share of resource. Unsurprisingly, deadlocks are common and typically compromises are reached only after the real period of biological then economic crisis has passed. Examples to illustrate this tendency can be found in most of the world's oceans and is writ large within the current impasse over blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) in the North Atlantic. The development of this fishery is discussed and it is shown that despite the scope to add value to the resource base through a pattern of exploitation focussed more upon human consumption than fish meal and oil, there seems little incentive to extricate participants from the cycle of demise that has engulfed negotiations so far. In an at tempt to consider how such seemingly intractable problems might be resolved, attention is next turned to the construction of a new model for resource management specifically intended to contend with the problems thrown up by straddling stocks. Central to this is the need to ensure motivation and incentivisation of value chain members in both national economic zones and international waters. It is proposed that a Multinational Resource Cooperative (MRC) is established and would be the key element in the management model. The MRC, on behalf of the national stakeholders, would auction quota so that fish enterprises can purchase quota units defined in terms of species, quantity, catch area and the time of catch. The MRC would also be financed through a quota auction fee as explained below and arrange its own quota control and enforcement services. By auctioning rights to stakeholders the MRC will enable control and enforcement of the TAC; allocations of fair national shares of resource and critically, motivate fish enterprises to devise and implement market-oriented value adding strategies. Adoption of such a scheme should result in a more efficient use of the remaining straddling stocks whilst there is still time to do so. Importantly, the proposed rent distribution mechanism would also shift the focus of negotiations from being dominated by quotas and access rights to more evident pecuniary metrics. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Genotyping and pathogenicity of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus from free-living turbot (Psetta maxima) in a Turkish coastal area of the Black Sea,"Nishizawa, T.; Savaş, H.; Işidan, H.; Üstündaǧ, C.; Iwamoto, H.; Yoshimizu, M.","Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) is one of the most serious fish viral diseases for cultured rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), although VHS virus (VHSV) seems to be ubiquitous among marine fishes. In the present study, VHSV isolation was performed with free-living and cultured turbot (Psetta maxima) in the Trabzon coastal area of the Black Sea to evaluate participation of VHSV in mass mortalities of seed-produced turbot larvae. VHSV was detected in 14 of 66 free-living spawners (positive ratio, 21.2%), 1 of 65 free-living immature fish (1.5%) and 7 of 40 cultured brood stock (17.5%), respectively. Based on a partial glycoprotein gene nucleotide sequence, Turkish VHSV isolates were classified into the class I-e of genotype I and were the most closely related to the GE-1.2 isolate (>98% identity), which was found >20 years ago in Georgia. Thus, it was revealed that Turkish VHSV isolates were not introduced from European countries, it could be an indigenous type of VHSV distributing in the Black Sea environment. In pathogenicity tests, the Turkish isolates did not induce mortality in turbot larvae and rainbow trout fingerlings. Mass mortalities at a rate of approximately 90% occurred in turbot larvae produced by experimental seeding, although VHSV was not detected in any dead fish. Thus, it was concluded that mass mortality in the seed-produced turbot larvae was not caused by VHSV infection. Copyright © 2006. American Society for Microbiology.

Comparing the management effectiveness of a marine park and a multiple-use collaborative fisheries management area in East Africa,"McClanahan, T.R.; Verheij, E.; Maina, J.","1. The coral reefs across the international border between Kenya and Tanzania, where historical differences in government policy and socio-economic conditions created two different management systems, were examined: a large permanent closed area and a collaborative fisheries management project that used gear management and small voluntarily and temporary closed areas, respectively. The diversity and ecology of the reefs in these two management systems were compared spanning a seven-year period to evaluate the effectiveness of the management and to assess the ecological response to a large-scale water-temperature anomaly in 1998. 2. Comparisons of rates of predation on sea urchins and of herbivory, using a seagrass assay, were made along with measures of benthic cover and fish abundance and diversity. 3. The collaborative fisheries management system was successful in increasing fish stocks, reducing erect algae, and maintaining ecological diversity and stability across the thermal anomaly. This management system, however, was not successful in protecting the expected full biodiversity of fish, predation rates on sea urchins, or the sensitive, branching coral species. Management of the fishery also increased fish stocks in the adjacent, large, permanently closed area, compared to Kenyan parks without this management. 4. The large, permanently closed area in the other system maintained high diversity, high predation rates on sea urchins and high herbivory rates, which maintained erect algae abundance and diversity at low levels. The temperature anomaly was destructive to a number of the dominant delicate branching coral species, but overall coral cover and diversity were maintained, although dominance switched from branching Porites spp. to Seriatopora spp. over this period. The large closed area system protected the undisturbed ecology of these reefs and associated ecological processes, and the full diversity of fish and coral, including sensitive species such as branching corals and slow-growing fish. 5. Collaborative fisheries and large permanent closed area management have different attributes that, when combined, should achieve the multiple purposes of sustainable fisheries, ecosystem functions and protection of fishing-sensitive species.

"Mental health problems, use of mental health services, and attrition from military service after returning from deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan","Hoge, C.W.; Auchterlonie, J.L.; Milliken, C.S.","Context: The US military has conducted population-level screening for mental health problems among all service members returning from deployment to Afghanistan, Iraq, and other locations. To date, no systematic analysis of this program has been conducted, and studies have not assessed the impact of these deployments on mental health care utilization after deployment. Objectives: To determine the relationship between combat deployment and mental health care use during the first year after return and to assess the lessons learned from the postdeployment mental health screening effort, particularly the correlation between the screening results, actual use of mental health services, and attrition from military service. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based descriptive study of all Army soldiers and Marines who completed the routine postdeployment health assessment between May 1, 2003, and April 30, 2004, on return from deployment to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan (n = 16 318), Operation Iraqi Freedom (n = 222 620), and other locations (n = 64 967). Health care utilization and occupational outcomes were measured for 1 year after deployment or until leaving the service if this occurred sooner. Main Outcome Measures: Screening positive for posttraumatic stress disorder, major depression, or other mental health problems; referral for a mental health reason; use of mental health care services after returning from deployment; and attrition from military service. Results: The prevalence of reporting a mental health problem was 19.1% among service members returning from Iraq compared with 11.3% after returning from Afghanistan and 8.5% after returning from other locations (P<.001). Mental health problems reported on the postdeployment assessment were significantly associated with combat experiences, mental health care referral and utilization, and attrition from military service. Thirty-five percent of Iraq war veterans accessed mental health services in the year after returning home; 12% per year were diagnosed with a mental health problem. More than 50% of those referred for a mental health reason were documented to receive follow-up care although less than 10% of all service members who received mental health treatment were referred through the screening program. Conclusions: Combat duty in Iraq was associated with high utilization of mental health services and attrition from military service after deployment. The deployment mental health screening program provided another indicator of the mental health impact of deployment on a population level but had limited utility in predicting the level of mental health services that were needed after deployment. The high rate of using mental health services among Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans after deployment highlights challenges in ensuring that there are adequate resources to meet the mental health needs of returning veterans. ©2006 American Medical Association.

Patient ethnicity and use of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis,"Gelber, R.P.; Seto, T.B.","Objective. Patients at highest risk for developing venous thromboembolism include those undergoing major orthopedic surgery. However, physicians vary in their strategies to prevent venous thromboembolism. We evaluated whether the use of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after orthopedic surgery is related to patient ethnicity. Design. Retrospective cohort study, 1998-2002. Setting. Tertiary care, university-affiliated hospital in Hawaii. Study participants. 1811 adults (1085 women; 743 Asians; 206 Pacific Islanders; mean age 70.6 ± 14.7 years) who underwent hip replacement, hip fracture surgery, or total knee replacement. Main outcome measures. Use of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis as recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with prophylaxis use. Results. Overall, 49.4% of patients received venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. After adjustment for patient age, sex, thromboembolism and bleeding risk factors, type of surgery, and anesthesia, Japanese patients were less likely to receive prophylaxis [odds ratio (OR) = 0.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.5-0.9; P = 0.01], whereas other ethnic groups were treated similarly to whites. Relative to patients undergoing hip replacement, those with hip fracture surgery were less likely (OR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.3-0.5; P < 0.01), and those receiving total knee replacement more likely (OR = 4.5; 95% CI = 3.6-5.7; P < 0.01) to receive appropriate prophylaxis. Conclusion. Despite consensus recommendations, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis use among high-risk patients remains low. Japanese patients and those undergoing hip fracture surgery are at particular risk for not receiving appropriate prophylaxis in our population. Further research is needed to clarify the reasons for our findings and to determine if this variation is associated with increased risk of thromboembolic complications. © The Author 2005.

PEMSEA has projects to promote Integrated Coastal Management (ICM), environmental risk assessment and management, capacity building, partnerships among various stakeholders, etc. In this study, following the description on the implementation status of activities under PEMSEA, the needs for a comprehensive assessment framework for the programme are identified. Then, this article presents a method to evaluate effects of projects implemented under PEMSEA in quantitative manner, because the existing evaluations of PEMSEA activities have focused on qualitative aspects. The presented system model is formulated to include not only environmental data but also socio-economic factors such as GRP, industrial production, activities of marine industry, change of population, etc. Such quantitative evaluation method is useful when each stakeholder examines real benefit of regional marine environmental cooperation and decides on how to commit such activities. Especially, the evaluation model will provide important suggestion toward Japanese environmental diplomacy in East Asia. © 2006, JAPAN SECTION OF THE REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.

"Metallothioneins induction and antioxidative response in aquatic worms Tubifex tubifex (Oligochaeta, Tubificidae) exposed to copper","Mosleh, Y.Y.; Paris-Palacios, S.; Biagianti-Risbourg, S.","Metallothioneins (MTs), are low molecular weight proteins, mainly implicated in metal ion detoxification. Increase in MT contents is considered as a specific biomarker of metal exposure. Recently it has been demonstrated that MTs participate in several cellular functions such as regulation of growth, and antioxidative defences. Tubifex tubifex were exposed to different copper concentrations (50, 100, and 200 μg l-1) for 7 and 15 days. MT levels in exposed worms increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) after 7 and 15 days of exposure to different concentrations of copper (maximum +208% for 100 μg l-1 after 7 days of exposure). Also important perturbation in metal-metallothionein content occurred, along with an increase in total soluble protein content in all treated worms after 7 and 15 days (max. +88.49%). Catalase activities (CAT) in Cu treated-worms were significantly increased, and demonstrated a development of antioxidative defenses. Additionally a reduction of gulathione-S-transferase (GST) was observed in all treated worms after 7 days of exposure to Cu (max. -44.42%). The high induction of MTs observed during T. tubifex exposure to Cu make them potentially useful biomarkers to monitor metal pollution. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Serum polychlorinated biphenyl and organochlorine insecticide concentrations in a Faroese birth cohort,"Barr, D.B.; Weihe, P.; Davis, M.D.; Needham, L.L.; Grandjean, P.","A prospective birth cohort of 1022 participants was established in the Faroe Islands over a 21-month period during 1986-1987. We collected questionnaire data on potential persistent organic pollutant (POP) concentration predictors, such as duration of breastfeeding and blubber consumption. To assess the participants' exposure from in utero to 14 years of age to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the insecticide p,p′-DDT and its primary degradate p,p′-DDE, we measured 37 PCB congeners and pesticides in 316 umbilical cord samples taken from participants at birth, in 124 serum samples collected from participants at approximately 7 years of age, and in 795 serum samples collected from participants at 14 years of age. Measurements of higher chlorination PCB congeners made on individuals' serum samples collected at 7 years and 14 years were highly correlated (typically r > 0.5, p > 0.01), although their concentrations at 7 years were generally two to three times higher than at 14 years. Similarly, umbilical cord PCB concentrations were correlated with PCB concentrations in both 7- and 14-year serum samples. Sex-specific differences in higher chlorination PCB and p,p′-DDE concentrations were found at 14 years but not at 7 years, although a sex interaction with blubber consumption and nursing duration was observed at both ages. Both duration of breastfeeding and consumption of blubber were significant predictors of serum ∑PCB concentrations at 7 and 14 years. Multivariate analyses showed that breastfeeding duration was the primary contributor to serum ∑PCB concentrations at 7 years, and blubber consumption was the primary contributor at 14 years. These data suggest that infant exposures from breastfeeding were sufficiently large so that continued exposures to PCBs, p,p′-DDT, and p,p′-DDE through the diet have not fully diluted their contribution to the ∑PCB and p,p′-DDE body burden of the children. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Automated dam data acquisition and alarm reporting system (ADDAARS) in Puerto Rico,"Pérez, M.A.; Parks, J.E.; Díaz, P.L.; Del Rio, M.P.","The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) has worked for the past 2 years to develop an Automated Dam Data Acquisition and Alarm Reporting System (ADDAARS) for 29 major reservoirs in Puerto Rico. The system records and transmits reservoir stage, inflows, gate openings, outflows and rainfall for the reservoirs in real-time. Given the safety criteria during extreme hydrologic events, it is essential to determine the existing alert level at each reservoir to allow the timely and safe operation of the reservoirs, implement emergency action plans, and coordinate with emergency management agencies. Various types of equipment were installed at the reservoirs to provide the necessary data to calculate inflow, outflow, and rate of change at each site. This innovative system combines satellite and radio telemetry, which results in redundancy and maximizes data availability. A Data Collection Platform (DCP) is used to collect, store, and prepare data for transmission via satellite and radio. The DCP transmits data to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GEOS) east satellite. Line of sight, network-capable radios deliver redundant data from the DCP to the receiving site and are fully integrated into the PREPA island-wide network. Data are received, stored, and analyzed at an emergency operation center at the PREPA offices in Santurce and in turn at four remote centers across the island. All data are stored on two servers, one located at the USGS Caribbean Water Science Center and another at PREPA corporate offices. The server located at the USGS offices collects only satellite data and the server at the PREPA offices collects only radio-based data. Bidirectional replication of data occurs between the servers at 5-minute intervals. The system incorporates a user-friendly graphical application to manipulate data, manage alert criteria, and to generate predefined detailed and summary reports. The system provides the tools to monitor conditions of reservoirs at the emergency operation center and at remote centers in respective regions of the island. ADDAARS provides real-time data to assist safe dam operation, reduces emergency response time, and provides a precise and consistent data collection system. © 2005 by Association of State Dam Safety Officials All rights reserved.",2005,,,,,111-121,,,,#21355,Pérez 2005,,
Transportation infrastructure in Asia: Priorities that will facilitate trade with Europe,"Deonas, N.; Martland, C.","This paper examines the implications of the rapid growth in demand for trade between Europe and Asia for the existing transportation network and logistics infrastructure. Trade between Asia and Europe potentially involves highways and railways, as well as ocean and air transportation. It is thus more complex than the highly developed trade between Asia and the Americas, which is of necessity focused on ports and airports. Upgrading the infrastructure to support trade with Europe will require efforts in the following major areas: 1) transportation and logistics technologies need to be improved and made compatible with each other, 2) multimodalism and modal interconnectivity need to be fully implemented, 3) capacities have to grow, facility efficiencies need to improve, 4) planning processes, and government policies need to be updated. The nature and extent of the required changes depend on the role of each country in the region, as well as the capabilities and utilization of the existing infrastructure. Based upon an assessment of each country's major transportation modes, their logistical infrastructure, and their use of IT, the forty-eight Asian countries were grouped into three categories according to their level of development. Leading economies of the region appear to be very successful and are highly competitive in global trade. They possess an overall adequate network but in some cases their facilities are limited by space constraints or challenged by congestion. Suggestions include network optimization and use of high technology applications, such as ITS and EDI that can improve these countries' efficiency and capacity utilization of the existing network. Developing countries of the region need to further implement best practices and attract funds for the development of their infrastructure. The quality and extent of their transport networks vary and there is a lack of coordination and integration among modes. A lack of paved roads and regional inequalities are the main concerns of their systems. These countries need to add infrastructure in all the different modes of transportation sufficient for international and interregional trade, finalize the connections within the rail, ocean, and trucking industry to facilitate multimodal trade and expand the capacity of existing routes to keep pace with traffic. They also need to attract foreign investment and lower taxation and tariffs in order to assist their economy and global positioning. Poorer and less developed countries have inadequate or non-existent infrastructure. They lack public transit modes and old vehicles operate on a largely unpaved network. Freight traffic is severely hampered by low speeds on low-capacity obsolete networks, which add delays and risks to the operation. Furthermore, cooperation with their neighboring countries is almost non-existing. These countries need to build or expand their basic infrastructure in order to assist in the transportation of their own products, and they must be able to communicate much more effectively with the rest of the world. Because of their location, some of these countries could play a greater role in international trade, but only if they achieve political stability and upgrade their networks to be compatible and connected with those of their neighbors. © (2005) by the Transportation Research Forum.

"Chapter 14 Oil pollution in the ROPME sea area-prevention, abatement, combating","Mohammadi, H.","The ROPME Sea Area (RSA) is considered to be an area with one of the highest oil pollution risks in the world. This is mainly due to the concentration of offshore installations, tanker loading terminals, and the huge volume and density of marine transportation of oil. The operational and accidental oil pollution is a major challenge in the RSA. The impacts of offshore installations of oil and gas particularly those of produced water on the marine environment in general and in shallow waters or near to ecologically sensitive areas in particular are noticeable. The operational pollution from ships and dumping of ballast water are also among the main causes of chronic oil pollution in the Region. At the same time, there are a great number of marine emergency cases resulting in substantial pollution or imminent threat of substantial pollution to the marine environment by oil from collisions, strandings and other incidents involving oil tankers, blow-outs arising from petroleum drilling and production activities, and the presence of oil from the failure of industrial installations. Such marine emergencies as published in the Oil Spill Intelligence Report indicate that 30% of oil spills greater than ten million gallons world-wide are related to the ROPME Region. Another major concern of environmental authorities is the introduction of invasive species that could threaten ecosystems, habitats, and species. To this effect, the establishment of reception facilities for oily wastes and other wastes, and the application of all appropriate measures for the control and management of ships' ballast water and sediments are now on the high priority agenda to be pursued attentively. To address the environmental challenge of oil pollution, a series of program activities for the prevention, abatement, and combating of land-based and sea-based sources of marine oil pollution have been developed and implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Kuwait Regional Convention and its Protocols. Accordingly, marine oil emergency preparedness and response are dealth with by the Emergency Protocol, offshore oil pollution prevention abatement, and control are addressed by the Continental Shelf Protocol, land-based sources of oil pollution are covered by the LBA Protocol, and transportation and disposal of wastes such as ballast water and oily wastes from ships and the establishment of reception facilities are addressed by the Transboundary Protocol. Other areas of focus have been the application of EIA for major development projects, the use of satellite receiving and processing system for monitoring of marine and coastal areas, the oil emergency preparedness and response, and a comprehensive program for training and capacity-building. All these programs are the central objectives of the Kuwait Action Plan (KAP), and have been carefully pursued by way of a coordinated National and Regional process-oriented framework of action. This chapter also describes the institutional arrangements developed for the implementation of the regional instruments. To this effect, liaison has been established and maintained between ROPME and the Contracting States, as well as with the competent regional and international organizations. Such arrangements have been made to ensure that cooperation and coordination of action are achieved on a regional basis. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Responding to a potentially trans boundary oil spill,"Sintian, C.; Yusof, M.R.; Othman, A.","On 18th October 2004, crude oil leak from a sub-sea pipeline transporting crude from offshore oil fields to an onshore crude oil terminal spilled into the South China Sea, 2km off the southwest coast of Labuan Island. Within one hour, oil slick landed on a public beach, and two days later was spotted on a Marine Park beach, about 35 km from Brunei waters. PETRONAS Carigali's Emergency Control Centers were activated, and relevant agencies were notified immediately. A Tier 1 response was upgraded quickly to a Tier 2 response coordinated by Labuan Beach Cleanup Committee, consisting of members from various government authorities, oil and gas industries, NGOs and the Petroleum Industry Malaysia Mutual Aid Group (PIMMAG). Great efforts were put in to prevent the spill from moving to Brunei waters, which could have escalated into a more complicated Tier 3 response, and activated the Malaysia National Oil Spill Control Contingency Plan and Standard Operating Procedure for Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam. Established Emergency Response Plan, Oil Spill Contingency Plan and Notification Procedures, coupled with established working relationship with the members of Labuan Beach Cleanup Committee has contributed to the quick 18-day cleanup operations. The use of proper equipment and dispersant, deployment of oil spill response experts and more than 500 oil spill responders has also contributed to the successful cleanup operations. A post cleanup environmental impact assessment was conducted and concluded that impacts were localized and temporary, with no significant damage to the marine environment. The presence of gastropods, crustacean and fishes at the spills sites within weeks after the cleanup operations indicates good biological recovery. This paper demonstrates the importance of collaboration between the government agencies and the industries in order to effectively respond to the spill. It also discussed the problems encountered and overcome along the way. This experience proves that an oil spill event can be responded quickly to, economically, and with minimum environmental damage if there is proper planning, effective communication, coupled with a highly cooperative response organization.

Corrosion on Deep Gulf Shipwrecks of World War II,"Overfield, M.L.","During the summer of 2004, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Sanctuary Program (NMSP) participated with Minerals Management Service (MMS), NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration (NOAA OE) and C&C Technologies, under the auspices of the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP), in an investigation to study the ""artificial reef effect"" of manmade structures in differing depths, and conversely, the effect of the environment on those structures over the course of 60 years, by studying six steel-hulled vessels sunk in the Gulf of Mexico. The National Marine Sanctuary used this opportunity to conduct research on the effects of corrosion on the six vessels identified for study. Corrosion on Deep Gulf Shipwrecks of World War II project represents Phase II of NOAA's RUST database project. Through this study, we addressed the following questions: Does depth of a wreck effect state of corrosion? Is this primarily a chemical, physical or biological process? Do ferrous-hulled shipwrecks follow a fairly consistent degradation process as they age? Is it possible to attach a specific timeline to the degradation scale? The corrosion processes affecting the structural integrity of these vessels is important for two reasons. If we begin to gain an understanding on the corrosive processes at work, we may be able to develop an approximate time line on the eventual fate of these vessels. Second, applying this corrosion timeline, it may enable us to anticipate when tanks and holds containing fuel oils or other hazardous materials will fail and release their cargos into the environment. Using this information, resource protection personnel can assess sites and determine which vessels are considered for direct intervention such as the removal of the threat sources, isolation of the threat, and management plan development or establishment of a monitoring protocol for the site. The survey has added valuable assessment data on steel-hulled vessels and contributes to our understanding of both chemical and biological corrosion in the marine environment. The survey also contributes to the field of underwater research, allowing interpretation and peer review of the results, provides baseline data to examine long-term protection strategies for National Marine Sanctuaries currently threatened by shipwrecks containing oil within or in close proximity to their boundaries.",2005,,,,,11242-11248,,,,#21360,Overfield 2005,,
Integrating trustee issues into a balanced response: Working toward a common goal,"Parker-Hall, H.A.; Hampton, S.; Haas, J.","In February 2002, a Unified Command (UC) comprised of the United States Coast Guard (USCG), the California Department of Fish and Game's Office of Spill Prevention and Response (OSPR), and other state and federal agencies tested a sample of oil taken from the water near the wreck SS Jacob Luckenbach. Oil from this fifty-year-old wreck, submerged in 176 feet of water 17 miles off San Francisco, matched oil that had impacted thousands of birds and miles of shoreline since November 2001. It also matched oil from mystery spills in this area dating back to 1992. Now that the source of this extensive pollution was found, the next step seemed simple: remove the oil from the vessel. Yet there were many issues surrounding this vessel and its location that required significant cooperation with many agencies and trustees. The Luckenbach is an historic property, protected by the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). It is submerged in the Gulf of Farallones National Marine Sanctuary - one of the most biologically productive regions off the California coast and home to many sensitive resources including several listed species. The UC realized that dialogue with and among the natural resource trustee agencies was crucial to planning balanced operations that would remove the pollution source while providing the utmost protection available to the resources at risk. A task force was formed that allowed trustees to engage in discussions about the tradeoffs of initiating removal as quickly as possible while balancing the risk of harm that any incidental release during operations may cause to their resources of concern. One of the most exciting benefits of this cooperative effort was the shift in thinking beyond just responding to the incident to advanced planning of a response that would best enhance restoration and long-term recovery. In many responses, it is not always clear that everyone has the same priorities: the USCG may focus on recovering oil and mitigating damage, the responsible party wants to minimize costs, and the trustees want to protect and restore their resources. In this case, the trustees and USCG were clearly working together toward common goals: removing a source of chronic oil pollution while minimizing environmental impacts from the response.",2005,,,,,10100-10106,,,,#21361,Parker-Hall 2005,,
The wreck of the Lee Wang Zin,"Bayliss, R.; Spoltman, R.","Environmental effects and cleanup efforts involved in Alaska's largest (length of shoreline affected) marine oil spill are recounted. Some 2,381 to 7,143 barrels (bbl) of heavy bunker fuel and diesel oil were released during high winds into Alaskan and Canadian waters as a result of the 1979 Christmas Day capsize of the Taiwanese oil freighter, M/V Lee Wang Zin, off the southern edge of the Alaska Panhandle. Over 350 miles (mi.) of shoreline were contaminated within a week of the accident, and oil slicks identified as products of the spill were sited a month later, 210 mi. north of the vessel's grounding site off the southeast tip of Prince of Wales island. During tow to deep-water burial, the vessel unexpectedly sank 8 mi. from an internationally known sea bird sanctuary. Overall, many sensitive fish, mammal, bird, and shellfish resources were potentially impacted, furbearers and waterfowl, probably most seriously. Moreover, severe weather conditions and rugged terrain presented unique problems for cleanup operations, access, and logistics. By the end of April, 1980, some 585 bbl of oil had been removed at a cost of $2,089,000 ($3,570/bbl). Additional oil deposits were being found and disposed of through October, but the final resting places of some oil patches still remained to be located. Oil recovery and burning methods, including a successful propane-torching technique, are described and results tabulated. Cooperative emergency and scientific efforts involved federal, state, and local representatives, including the U.S. and Canadian Coast Guards, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, Alaska State Troopers, and the Ketchikan Department of Fish and Game.

Ecological risk assessment - A high speed version used in New Zealand,"Stevens, L.; Gibbs, M.; Roberts, J.; Maxwell, D.; Service, R.","Cooperative oil spill Ecological Risk Assessment (C-ERA) is a preparedness tool that seeks consensus-based decisions regarding potential spill and spill response impacts. The established US Coast Guard ERA approach has generally used 1-2 multi-day workshops, several weeks apart, to identify and work through key issues. In New Zealand (NZ), funding limitations required a faster approach. This paper describes the advantages and disadvantages encountered during a modified 1-day version of the ERA conducted for the Fiordland region. Fiordland is a highly valued and remote National Park and World Heritage Area of 1.25 million Ha, with ∼200km of exposed coastline, and ∼1800km internal coastline including 15 main fiords. The unique climate, topography, bathymetry and oceanography, in addition to limited access and infrastructure, make marine pollution response inherently difficult. Recent increases in cruise ship and commercial maritime activity has increased the spill risk, especially for fuel oil. Information previously gathered from interest/advocate groups and government agencies was used to identify priority resources and summarise the spill risk. Then, at a 1-day workshop, six experts in Fiordland ecology, spill response and ERA processes defined the most ecologically important areas and priority resources across the region, and their susceptibility to oil. Levels of concern were applied to each area and identified resource, and the preferred response options and their feasibility defined. Outputs were presented on a series of planning maps and site sheets completed for each priority area after the workshop which were circulated for stakeholder review. The approach enabled a defensible response plan to be generated quickly and cheaply. It secured input from agencies who would not have participated had a greater time input been required and generated a concise document for public consultation and a template for ongoing refinement. The success of the approach was due largely to the high level of trust between scientific and response agencies in NZ, and a shared desire to rapidly improve response planning outcomes. Disadvantages were the inability to fully review and include all available technical information, limited public consultation, and tight time pressures. Examples are given of the benefit of the plan following its use during a recent spill of marine diesel.",2005,,,,,10581-10586,,,,#21363,Stevens 2005,,
"Emergency and long-term restoration planning for the 1999 Olympic Pipe Line Company spill, Whatcom Creek, Bellingham, Washington, USA","Helton, D.; Doty, D.","The restoration planning efforts for the June 10, 1999, Olympic Pipe Line Company gasoline spill illustrate the benefits of cooperative and restoration-based damage assessment. The Incident resulted in the release of approximately 236,000 gallons of gasoline into Whatcom Creek, Bellingham, Washington. The spilled gasoline ignited, burning much of the riparian vegetation including a large section of mature forest in an urban park. The combination of the spill and fire resulted in the complete elimination of terrestrial and aquatic biota in several miles of the creek. Affected biota included several species of juvenile salmonids, including chinook salmon, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The Incident also resulted in recreational fishing and park closures. The Oil Pollution Act regulations require the Trustees to invite the Responsible Party to participate in the damage assessment and restoration process. By working together, restoration of injured resources and services may be achieved more rapidly and cost-effectively. Shortly after the Incident, the Trustees and the Company recognized that a cooperative process would reduce duplication of studies, increase the cost-effectiveness of the assessment process, increase sharing of information, decrease the likelihood of litigation, and, most importantly, speed the restoration process. Another benefit of the cooperation was the ability to accomplish restoration goals in coordination with the emergency response activities. This paper summarizes the overall Incident and discusses the restoration planning process, including the emergency and long-term restoration actions.",2005,,,,,9688-9692,,,,#21364,Helton 2005,,
A synthesis of marine conservation planning approaches,"Leslie, H.M.","In the last decade, there has been increasing interest-particularly among international non-governmental and multilateral development organizations-in evaluating the effectiveness of conservation and development projects. To evaluate success, we need more comprehensive and case-specific information on how conservation decisions are made. I report on a database that synthesizes information on 27 marine conservation planning cases from around the world. I collected data on each case's geographic scale, primary planning objective and outcome, legal and institutional context, degree of stakeholder involvement, and the ecological criteria and tools used to facilitate conservation decisions. The majority of cases were located in North and Central America, were regional in nature, and had biodiversity conservation as the primary planning objectives. Outcomes included priority-setting plans and implementation of marine reserves and other types of marine protected areas. Governments and local nongovernmental organizations led more participatory processes than national and international nongovernmental organizations. Eleven cases considered ecological criteria first, whereas 16 relied on integrated criteria (ecological plus socioeconomic data and other pragmatic considerations) to select priority areas for conservation and management action. Key tools for data integration and synthesis were expert workshops, maps, and reserve-selection algorithms (i.e., computer-based tools for priority setting and reserve design). To facilitate evaluation of success, future documentation of marine conservation planning cases should include a standard set of ecological, social, economic, and institutional elements. To develop standards for effective marine conservation, a more diverse set of documented cases is needed; for example, those that failed were located outside North and Central America, focused on the local geographic scale, or were motivated by objectives other than biodiversity conservation. ©2005 Society for Conservation Biology.",2005,,Conservation Biology,19,6,1701-1713,,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00268.x,,#21366,Leslie 2005,,
A multidisciplinary approach to assessing the sustainability of freshwater crayfish harvesting in Madagascar,"Jones, J.P.G.; Andriahajaina, F.B.; Hockley, N.J.; Balmford, A.; Ravoahangimalala, O.R.","There is growing interest among conservation decision makers in promoting harvesting of forest products as an incentive for communities to retain forest cover. Assessments of the sustainability of existing harvests are essential for implementing such policies. Madagascar's endemic freshwater crayfish, Astacoides spp., are harvested throughout their range. Despite their importance to human communities, Madagascar's crayfish, like much of the island's freshwater biodiversity, are poorly known, and there is concern that the harvest may be unsustainable. We investigated sustainability of the crayfish harvest in and around Ranomafana National Park in eastern Madagascar, focusing on the heavily harvested A. granulimanus. Several villages around the park have traditional taboos against selling crayfish, resulting in widely varying levels of crayfish exploitation. We used two approaches to assess sustainability of the harvest. First we used participatory mapping combined with a geographic information system analysis to produce a spatially accurate map of harvesting intensity. We then carried out mark-and-recapture sampling at 74 sites across a range of harvest intensities to test whether the level of harvesting was a significant predictor of crayfish density and structure. Second, we used size-structured matrix population models to estimate the forest area necessary to provide the observed annual harvest from one harvesting village and compared this estimate with the area available to the harvesters. Our findings show that the crayfish harvest in Ranomafana may be sustainable under current socioeconomic conditions, suggesting that A. granulimanus is less vulnerable to overexploitation than previously thought. We emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to assessing sustainability involving both ecological information about the harvested species and socioeconomic data about the level and spatial pattern of the harvest. ©2005 Society for Conservation Biology.",2005,,Conservation Biology,19,6,1863-1871,,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00267.x,,#21367,Jones 2005,,
Assimilation of polysaccharides and glucose by major bacterial groups in the Delaware Estuary,"Elifantz, H.; Malmstrom, R.R.; Cottrell, M.T.; Kirchman, D.L.","The contribution of major bacterial groups to the assimilation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and glucose in the Delaware Estuary was assessed using microautoradiography and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Bacterial groups contributed to EPS and glucose assimilation in part according to their distribution in the estuary. Abundance of the phylogenetic groups explained 35% and 55% of the variation in EPS and glucose assimilation, respectively. Actinobacteria contributed 70% to glucose assimilation in fresh-water, while Alphaproteobacteria assimilated 60% of this compound in saline water. In contrast, various bacterial groups dominated the assimilation of EPS. Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria contributed the most in the freshwater section, whereas Cytophaga-like bacteria and Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria participated in EPS assimilation in the lower part of the estuary. In addition, we examined the fraction of bacteria in each group that assimilated glucose or EPS. Overall, the fraction of bacteria in all groups that assimilated glucose was higher than the fraction that assimilated EPS (15 to 30% versus 5 to 20%, respectively). We found no correlation between the relative abundance of a group in the estuary and the fraction of bacteria actively assimilating glucose or EPS; the more active groups were often less abundant.

"Smoking, quitting, and the risk of cardiovascular disease among women and men in the Asia-Pacific region","Woodward, M.; Lam, T.H.; Barzi, F.; Patel, A.; Gu, D.F.; Rodgers, A.; Suh, I.; Lawes, C.M.M.; MacMahon, S.W.; Pan, W.H.; Eushima, H.; Parag, V.; Okayama, A.; Maegawa, H.; Aoki, N.; Nakamura, M.; Kubo, N.; Yamada, T.; Wu, Z.S.; Yao, C.H.; Andrews, G.; Welborn, T.A.; Tang, Z.; Liu, L.S.; Xie, J.X.; Norton, R.; Ameratunga, S.; Whitlock, G.; Knuiman, M.W.; Cristensen, S.; Wu, X.G.; Zhou, J.; Yu, X.H.; Tamakoshi, A.; Wu, Z.L.; Chen, L.Q.; Shan, G.L.; Sritara, P.; Duan, X.F.; Jackson, R.; Li, Y.H.; Jiang, C.Q.; Fujishima, M.; Kiyohara, Y.; Iwamoto, H.; Woo, J.; Ho, S.C.; Hong, Z.; Huang, M.S.; Zhou, B.F.; Fub, J.L.; Kita, Y.; Choudhury, S.R.; Jee, S.H.; Kim, I.S.; Giles, G.; Hashimoto, T.; Sakata, K.; Dobson, A.; Imai, Y.; Ohkubo, T.; Hozawa, A.; Jamrozik, K.; Hobbs, M.; Broadhurst, R.; Nakachi, K.; Fang, X.H.; Li, S.C.; Yang, Q.D.; Chen, Z.M.; Tanaka, H.; Nozaki, A.; Horibe, H.; Matsutani, Y.; Kagaya, M.; Hughes, K.; Lee, J.; Heng, D.; Chew, S.K.; Zhang, H.Y.; Shimamoto, K.; Saitoh, S.; Li, Z.Z.; Norman, P.; He, Y.; Yao, S.X.","Background: Although smoking is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it has been suggested that Asians may be less susceptible to the adverse effects of smoking than Caucasians. This may have contributed to the high prevalence of smoking, and the low quitting rates, in Asian men. Worldwide, smoking rates are increasing for women, amongst whom cardiovascular awareness is relatively poor. Methods: An individual participant data analysis of 40 cohort studies was carried out, involving 463 674 Asians (33% female) and 98 664 Australasians (45% female). Cox proportional hazard models, stratified by study and sex where appropriate, were employed. Results: The HR [95% confidence interval (CI)], comparing current smokers with non-smokers, for coronary heart disease (CHD) was 1.60 (1.49-1.72); haemorrhagic stroke 1.19 (1.06-1.33); ischaemic stroke 1.38 (1.24-1.54). There was a clear dose-response relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and both CHD and stroke, with no significant difference (P≥ 0.20) between populations from Asia and Australia/New Zealand. Although there was no sex difference for stroke in the effect of amount smoked (P = 0.16), for CHD, women tended to have higher hazard ratios than men (P = 0.011). Quitting gave a clear benefit, which was not significantly different between the sexes or regions (P> 0.63). The HR (CI) for ex-smokers compared with current smokers was 0.71 (0.64-0.78) for CHD and 0.84 (0.76-0.92) for stroke. Conclusions: Unless urgent public health measures are put into place, the impact of the smoking epidemic in Asia, and among women, will be enormous. Tobacco control policies that specifically target these populations are essential. © The Author 2005; all rights reserved.",2005,,International Journal of Epidemiology,34,5,1036-1045,,10.1093/ije/dyi104,,#21371,Woodward 2005,,
AMS 14C dating of deglacial events in the Irish Sea Basin and other sectors of the British-Irish ice sheet,"McCabe, A.M.; Clark, P.U.; Clark, J.","Sedimentary sequences deposited by the decaying marine margin of the British-Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) record isostatic depression and successive ice sheet retreat towards centres of ice dispersion. Radiocarbon dating by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) of in situ marine microfaunas that are commonly associated with these sequences constrain the timing of glacial and sea level fluctuations during the last deglaciation, enabling us to evaluate the dynamics of the BIIS and its response to North Atlantic climate change. Here we use our radiocarbon-dated stratigraphy to define six major glacial and sea level events since the Last Glacial Maximum. (1) Initial deglaciation may have occurred ≥18.3 kyr 14C BP along the northwestern Irish coast, in agreement with a deglacial age of ∼22 36Cl kyr BP for southwestern Ireland. Ice retreated to inland centres and areas of transverse moraine began to form across the north Irish lowlands. (2) Channels cut into glaciomarine deglacial sediments along the western Irish Sea coast are graded to below present sea level, identifying a fall of relative sea level (RSL) in response to isostatic emergence of the coast. (3) Marine mud that rapidly infilled these channels records an abrupt rise in global sea level of 10-15 m ∼16.7 14C kyr BP that flooded the Irish Sea coast and may have triggered deglaciation of a marine-based margin in Donegal Bay. (4) Intertidal boulder pavements in Dundalk Bay indicate that RSL ∼15.0 14C kyr BP was similar to present. (5) A major readvance of all sectors of the BIIS occurred between 14 and 15 kyr 14C BP which overprinted subglacial transverse moraines and delivered a substantial sediment flux to tidewater ice sheet margins. This event, the Killard Point Stadial, indicates that the BIIS participated in Heinrich event 1. (6) Subsequent deposition of marine muds on drumlins 12.7 14C kyr BP indicates isostatic depression and attendant high RSL resulting from the Killard Point readvance. These events identify a dynamic BIIS during the last deglaciation, as well as significant changes in RSL that reflect a combination of isostatic loading and eustatic changes in global sea level. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"Biomass, litterfall and decomposition rates for the fringed Rhizophora mangle forest lining the Bon Accord Lagoon, Tobago","Juman, R.A.","The mangrove forest that fringes the Bon Accord Lagoon measures 0.8 km 2 and is dominated by red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle). This forest forms the landward boundary of the Buccoo Reef Marine Park in Southwest Tobago, and is part of a mangrove-seagrass-coral reef continuum. Biomass and productivity, as indicated by litterfall rates, were measured in seven 0.01 ha monospecific plots from February 1998 to February 1999, and decomposition rates were determined. Red mangrove above-ground biomass ranged between 2.0 and 25.9 kg (dry wt.) m-2. Mean biomass was 14.1±8.1 kg (dry wt.) m-2 yielding a standing crop of 11 318±6 488 t. Litterfall rate varied spatially and seasonally. It peaked from May to August (4.2-4.3 g dry wt. m-2 d-1) and was lowest from October to December (2.3-2.8 g dry wt. m-2 d-1). Mean annual litterfall rate was 3.4±0.9 g dry wt. m-2 d-1. Leaf degradation rates ranged from 0.3% loss d-1 in the upper intertidal zone to 1% loss d-1 at a lower intertidal site flooded by sewage effluent. Mean degradation rate was 0.4±1% loss d-1. The swamp produces 2.81 dry wt. of litterfall and 12 kg dry wt. of decomposed leaf material daily. Biomass and litterfall rates in Bon Accord Lagoon were compared to five similar sites that also participate in the Caribbean Coastal Marine Productivity Programme (CARICOMP).

"Medical considerations in triathlon competition: Recommendations for triathlon organisers, competitors and coaches","Dallam, G.M.; Jonas, S.; Miller, T.K.","Competitors in triathlons experience a range of environmental conditions and physiological demands in excess of that found in individual sport events of comparable duration. Consequently, there is a broad range of possible medical problems and complications that must be taken into account when preparing for such races. For most competitors, an Olympic-distance triathlon typically takes between 2-4 hours to complete. This race begins with a swimming segment of 1500m. Given the wide variety of race venues found around the world, these swims occur in an assortment of water temperatures (from warm to cold) and conditions (from ocean surf to lake calm). Swimmers often exit the water in a state of moderate dehydration and hypothermia and then immediately start the 40km cycling leg. Many do so in their swimming attire. A wide variety of road surfaces, technically challenging topography, variable environmental conditions and dramatically changing velocities can be encountered on the cycle course. The race concludes with a 10km running leg. Since it is the final leg, it is often completed in higher ambient temperatures than those encountered at the start, with the athlete possibly running in a significant state of dehydration and fatigue. Other medical problems commonly encountered in triathlon include: muscle cramping, heat illness, postural hypotension, excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation, musculoskeletal injuries and trauma, gastrointestinal problems as well as post-race bacterial infection, immunosuppression, sympathetic nervous system and psychological exhaustion, and haemolysis. The rate of occurrence of such events and the severity of their potentially negative outcomes is a function of the methods used by both the race organisers and the competitors to prevent or respond to the conditions imposed by the race. Triathletes also commonly compete in both shorter 'sprint distance' events (in the range of a 0.75km swim, 20km cycle and 5km run) and longer events including both one-half and full Ironman distances (2.5 and 3.8km swim, 80 and 180km cycle, 20 and 42km run, respectively), as well as ultra-distance events that exceed the Ironman distance. In the longer events, the previously mentioned medical considerations are further magnified and additional considerations such as hyponatraemia can also occur. Reducing risk associated with these concerns is accomplished by: taking into account weather and water temperature/conditions data prior to event scheduling; effective swim, cycle and run course organisation and management; environmental monitoring prior to and during the event; the implementation of a water safety plan; provision of appropriate fluid replacement throughout the course; implementation of helmet use and non-drafting regulations in the cycling leg; and competitor knowledge regarding fluid replacement, biomechanical technique, physical preparation, safe equipment and course familiarity. Despite these concerns, triathlon participation appears to relatively safe for persons of all ages, assuming that high-risk adults undertake health screening. © 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

"A multi-criteria approach to Great Barrier Reef catchment (Queensland, Australia) diffuse-source pollution problem","Greiner, R.; Herr, A.; Brodie, J.; Haynes, D.","This paper presents a multi-criteria based tool for assessing the relative impact of diffuse-source pollution to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the river basins draining into the GBR lagoon. The assessment integrates biophysical and ecological data of water quality and pollutant concentrations with socio-economic information pertaining to non-point source pollution and (potential) pollutant impact. The tool generates scores for each river basin against four criteria, thus profiling the basins and enabling prioritization of management alternatives between and within basins. The results support policy development for pollution control through community participation, scientific data integration and expert knowledge contributed by people from across the catchment. The results specifically provided support for the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan, released in October 2003. The aim of the plan is to provide a framework for reducing discharge of sediment, nutrient and other diffuse-source loads and (potential) impact of that discharge and for prioritising management actions both between and within river basins. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The Pacific and Indian Oceans were divided into 17 latitudinal boxes according to ocean circulation, global fallout patterns and the location of nuclear weapons test sites. The present levels and time trends in radionuclide concentrations in surface water for each box were studied and the corresponding effective half-lives were estimated. For the year 2000, the estimated average 90Sr, 137Cs and 239,240Pu concentrations in surface waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans varied from 0.1 to 1.5 mBq/L, 0.1 to 2.8 mBq/L, and 0.1 to 5.2 μBq/L, respectively. The mean effective half-lives for 90Sr and 137Cs in surface water were 12 ± 1 years for the North, 20 ± 1 years for the South and 21 ± 2 years for the Equatorial Pacific. For 239,240Pu the corresponding mean effective half-lives were 7 ± 1 years for the North, 12 ± 4 years for the South and 10 ± 2 years for the Equatorial Pacific. For the Indian Ocean the mean effective half-lives of 137Cs and 239,240Pu were 21 ± 2 years and 9 ± 1 years, respectively. There is evidence that fallout removal rates before 1970 were faster than those observed during recent decades. The estimated surface water concentrations of 90Sr, 137Cs and 239,240Pu in latitudinal belts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans for the year 2000 may be used as the average levels so that any new contribution from nuclear facilities, nuclear weapons test sites, radioactive waste dumping sites and from possible nuclear accidents can be identified. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Factors associated with forced sex among women accessing health services in rural Haiti: Implications for the prevention of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases,"Smith Fawzi, M.C.; Lambert, W.; Singler, J.M.; Tanagho, Y.; Léandre, F.; Nevil, P.; Bertrand, D.; Claude, M.S.; Bertrand, J.; Louissaint, M.; Jeannis, L.; Mukherjee, J.S.; Goldie, S.; Salazar, J.J.; Farmer, P.E.","The goals of the current study were to: (1) estimate the prevalence of forced sex among women accessing services at a women's health clinic in rural Haiti; and (2) examine factors associated with forced sex in this population. Based on data from a case-control study of risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), a cross-sectional analysis to examine factors associated with forced sex was performed. A number of factors related to gender inequality/socioeconomic vulnerability placed women in rural Haiti at higher risk of forced sex. The strongest factors associated with forced sex in multivariate analyses were: age, length of time in a relationship, occupation of the woman's partner, STD-related symptoms, and factors demonstrating economic vulnerability. The findings suggest that prevention efforts must go beyond provision of information and education to the pursuit of broader initiatives at both local and national levels. At the community level, policy-makers should consider advancing economic opportunities for women who are vulnerable to forced sex. Improving access to community-based income-generating activities may begin to address this problem. However, the viability of these local projects depends largely upon Haiti's 'macro-economic' situation. In order to ensure the success of local initiatives, external humanitarian and development assistance to Haiti should be supported. By broadening the definition of ""prevention"" interventions, we may begin to address the systemic problems that contribute to the occurrence of forced sex and the increasing incidence of HIV infection throughout the world, such as gender inequality and economic vulnerability. Taking into account factors influencing risk at the local level as well as the macro-level will potentially improve our capacity to reduce the risk of forced sex and the spread of STDs, including HIV infection, for millions of women living in poverty worldwide. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Integrated oceans management and the institutional performance of exclusive economic zones the Australian case,"Reichelt, R.E.; Wescott, G.C.","This paper addresses key issues in relation to the performance of exclusive economic zones (EEZs) as institutions, with particular reference to Australias Oceans Policy. Specifically: 1) What national institutions has Australia created within the framework provided by the EEZs, 2) What is the interplay between global agreements such as the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), the Australian Oceans Policy and regional management plans? These questions are considered in the case of Australias Oceans Policy with some comparison to other countries institutional arrangements. In the past five years Australia, Canada, the US, New Zealand, Pacific Islands, Korea, China, Thailand and other coastal states have either published or initiated work on a national policy for integrated oceans management. The institutional arrangements in each case vary considerably but, notwithstanding the cultural and economic differences among countries implementing oceans policies, there are emerging similarities such as the application of integrated management, ecosystem-based management, sustainable development and precautionary approaches. In 1998, the Australian government released its Oceans Policy (Australian Government, 1998) with a broad agenda of sustainable, multiple-use management of marine resources and the aim of combining both conservation and economic development in an integrated framework. A significant part of the policy included the goal of implementing Regional Marine Plans to ensure natural resources are managed for sustainable use. Specific challenges for implementing integrated oceans management in Australia include (a) integration of fisheries resource management in an ecosystem-based way across all gear types and regions where species are harvested; (b) integration of the designation and management of Marine Protected Areas with fisheries resource management to ensure that both conservation and industrial development goals are achieved; (c) development of adequate knowledge bases to support resource management of ocean ecosystems. The issues of institutional fit, interplay and scale provide a useful framework to assess the performance of EEZs (Young et al, 1999). The emerging issues in policy development outlined for the Australian case show that the large scale of ecosystems within EEZs call for the adjustment of institutional arrangements to fit biophysical systems and industrial structures. This seems to be happening through national cooperation in the Australian case, however the interplay between sectors below the level of the over-arching Oceans Policy are problematic and politically difficult to implement. It is likely to take decades before the success of integrated ocean management within EEZs can be properly evaluated. © 2005 Springer.

Motor vehicle collision risk and driving under the influence of cannabis: Evidence from adolescents in Atlantic Canada,"Asbridge, M.; Poulin, C.; Donato, A.","Employing a sample of 6087 senior students in Atlantic Canada, this paper examines the relationship between driving under the influence of cannabis (DUIC) and motor vehicle collision (MVC) risk. A series of models were analyzed adjusting for demographic characteristics, driver experience, and substance use. Participants were drawn from the 2002/2003 Student Drug Use Survey in the Atlantic Provinces, an anonymous cross-sectional survey of adolescent students in the Atlantic provinces of Canada. Logistic regression techniques were employed in the analysis of unadjusted and adjusted models. Among senior students, the prevalence of DUIC in the past year was 15.1% while the prevalence of MVCs was 8.1%. The predictors of DUIC were gender, driver experience, use of a fake ID, and driving under the influence of alcohol (DUIA). The predictors of MVC were gender, driver experience, DUIC, and DUIA.

Distribution and diversity of Fiji's terrestrial herpetofauna: Implications for forest conservation,"Morrison, C.","In 2003 The Wildlife Conservation Society attempted to evaluate the conservation status of Fiji's natural forests including identifying a series of biological provinces (based on the distribution and endemism of a number of terrestrial taxa) in which some form of conservation area would need to be established or maintained. A combination of literature surveys, consultations with local researchers, and targeted field surveys was used to identify herpetological provinces within Fiji. With the exception of the iguanas (restricted to dry forest habitats), the frogs, and one of the skink species (restricted to wet forest habitats), the herpetofauna of Fiji is widespread in terms of both geography and habitat type and consequently there are no real distinct species assemblages or communities. Based on areas with the highest levels of herpetofauna species richness and endemism, forest reserves need to be established or maintained on Yadua Taba, Taveuni (particularly the northern and eastern sides), Ono-i-Lau, Ovalau, Gau, Rotuma, and the Monasavu area of Viti Levu to maximize conservation of herpetofauna diversity. Because there are gaps in the knowledge of geographic distributions of species resulting from incomplete surveys of several areas of the country, further targeted surveys are needed to completely evaluate the distribution of all herpetofauna species in Fiji. © 2005 by University of Hawai'i Press All rights reserved.",2005,,Pacific Science,59,4,481-489,,10.1353/psc.2005.0049,,#21398,Morrison 2005,,

Hospitality and reciprocity: Working tourists in Dominica,"Heuman, D.","This study examines the importance of host-guest relationships in community-based, working holidays. It looks at a working vacation in the Carib Territory of Dominica to assess how sociocultural systems for the treatment of tourists feature in small-scale tourism. The study finds that such working holidays appear to imitate elements of traditional forms of hospitality. Some of the duties and obligations of host-guest relationships appear to be carried into the sphere of guest-local interactions, in particular, non-monetary reciprocities.

In addition to the local pollution events, high PM10 episodes are recorded during African dust outbreaks, regional atmospheric recirculation events (mainly in spring to autumn), and to a lesser extent, under the influence of European and Mediterranean long range transported air masses. The lowest PM10 levels are usually recorded under Atlantic air mass advective conditions. All these regional and large-scale processes account for the relatively high PM10 levels recorded in regional background stations in Spain. Thus, the PM10 levels recorded at EMEP (Cooperative Program for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long Range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe) regional background stations between March 2001 and March 2002 are very close to the annual limit value proposed for 2010 by the EU Air Quality Directive 1999/30/CE.

Seasonal variations in antioxidant defences in blue mussels Mytilus edulis collected from a polluted area: Major contributions in gills of an inducible isoform of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase and of glutathione S-transferase,"Manduzio, H.; Monsinjon, T.; Galap, C.; Leboulenger, F.; Rocher, B.","In the present work, we investigated in the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) the seasonal variations in the activity of several enzymes, which participate in the cellular defence system that is involved in the adaptive response of organisms to pollution. The activity levels of glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and three isoforms of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in gills and digestive glands of this bivalve species were used as biomarkers. Adult wild mussels were collected in Le Havre harbour (north-west coast of France) from four sites with different environmental conditions. Measurements of enzymatic activities were performed on tissue homogenates except for Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase for which the activity of each isoform was detected on gel after isoelectric focusing. Seasonal variations in antioxidant enzyme activities were observed, characterized by low activity levels during winter, a period where oxidative stress is known to be high in bivalves. A clear-cut discrepancy between tissues was noted concerning inter-individual variability of data, which was low in gills but high in digestive gland, leading to the conclusion that gills could preferentially be used in biomonitoring studies dealing with oxidative stress in the blue mussel. As compared to animals from the reference site, mussels from the most polluted sites exhibited changes in the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase pattern characterized by an increase in the activity of the more acidic isoform without significant variation of the total activity of the enzyme. The most striking data were recorded in mussels collected at the outlet of a thermoelectric power plant. When compared to animals from the reference site, not only their gills showed a highly significant induction of the most acidic isoform of the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (+340%, P < 0.001) but also high levels of glutathione S-transferase activity (+269%, P < 0.001). This study points out the usefulness of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase expression pattern as a biomarker of exposure to environmental stress rather than measurement of total activity of the enzyme, in field studies using Mytilus edulis. It also indicates the informative potential for glutathione S-transferase measurements in gills and underlines the advantages of selecting a battery of biomarkers for evaluating the impact of contamination on marine organisms. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Inhibition of P-glycoprotein transport: A mechanism for endocrine disruption in the channel catfish?,"Kleinow, K.M.; Hummelke, G.C.; Zhang, Y.; Uppu, P.; Baillif, C.","P-glycoprotein (pgp), an efflux transporter localized in a variety of tissues including the intestinal mucosa, renal tubules and bile canaliculi, is known to participate in the disposition of a variety of chemicals, including steroid hormones. This study examined the relationship of pgp to the movement into the bile of the hormone estradiol (E2), and the potential for transport interactions between the environmental pollutant nonylphenol ethoxylate (NPE) and E2. Biliary-cannulated in situ-prepared isolated perfused livers were used to assess pgp transport function. E2, in competitive transport preparations with Rhodamine 123 (Rho123), a pgp substrate, demonstrated significant decreases in Rho123 transport into bile, as did the prototypic inhibitor and substrate verapamil. [3H]E2 (0.28 nM) transport into bile was significantly reduced with either 20 μM NPE or verapamil. These results suggest that E2 is a substrate and/or modulator for the catfish biliary pgp transporter, and that NPE potentially influences biliary transport and excretion of E2. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"Systems thinking and green chemistry in the textile industry: Concepts, technologies and benefits","Moore, S.B.; Ausley, L.W.","The textile industry led the world into the industrial revolution and is leading the movement towards global manufacturing. During the period of 1980-1995, the textile industry in the United States was flourishing. It was during these times, that increased regulatory pressures initiated aquatic toxicity testing of wastewater discharges from publicly owned treatment works. Resolution of problems identified by these tests required the development of new toxicity assessment tools, and the use of systems thinking and community/industry/regulator dialogues. The case for the beneficial use of these tools is presented as an example of how to increase productivity through greener (environmentally conservative) production induced by cooperative stakeholder actions. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A model for alcohol-mediated violence in an Australian Aboriginal community,"Shore, J.H.; Spicer, P.","This study introduces a new model for understanding alcohol use and violence in a contemporary Australian Aboriginal community. Based on ethnographic and survey data collected in the community, which is not further identified in this manuscript, the model examines circumstantial, community- and individual-level factors surrounding alcohol use and its associated violence. Community member's beliefs about the effect of alcohol on individual behavior and emotion bring about the expectation that intoxicated individuals will remember past grievances and act upon them. Individual's actions are affected by community members' beliefs about alcohol as well as the individual's own more idiosyncratic beliefs and expectations, the disinhibiting qualities of alcohol, the individual's emotional state, and the circumstances surrounding a drinking episode. These factors interact to construct a situation in which ""being drunk"" encourages an individual to bring out grievances and conflicts and address them through physical confrontation. In this manner, alcohol acts as a conduit for the playing out of conflicts and tensions within the community. But this system represents a relatively ineffectual form of conflict mediation and tension reduction, thus suggesting an important critique of the classic ""time out"" thesis of drunken comportment. Drunken confrontations, rather than being a ""time out,"" represent an integrated part of the way in which conflicts are played out in the community. This model provides a useful framework for future research to examine alcohol-mediated conflict in indigenous communities. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Spill accident modeling: A critical survey of the event-decision network in the context of IMO's formal safety assessment,"Ventikos, N.P.; Psaraftis, H.N.","In this paper, we present the relationship between an oil spill-assessing approach, namely the event-decision network (EDN) and the formal safety assessment (FSA) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). We focus on various points at which the Network incorporates basic features of the FSA in order to formulate a state-of-the-art, original strategic tool. In keeping with a safety-friendly effort, we developed the EDN, which implements a scenario-driven, generic tree framework. Moreover, the IMO, under the umbrella of decision-making, has introduced FSA, which is a systematic methodology for enhanced maritime safety by using risk and cost/benefit criteria. It is of interest to describe the introduced spill-scenario analysis/simulation and to pinpoint its interconnections with the aforementioned official instrument. Among other things, the goal of such a task is the enhancement of marine safety and the subsequent protection of seas from oil spills. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Phytoplankton dynamics in the Bohai Sea - Observations and modelling,"Wei, H.; Sun, J.; Moll, A.; Zhao, L.","A Sino-German cooperative project (AMBOS/AMREB) was carried out to improve the understanding of the nutrient-phytoplankton dynamics with processes and governing factors through observation and modelling. Two cruises in April/May 1999, September 1998 and two 15-month coastal monitoring stations were completed and a three-dimensional model for the nutrients-phytoplankton cycle was established. During the cruises in spring and autumn, increased phytoplankton concentrations were found in the southern Bohai Sea characterized by high biomass in spring and higher production in autumn. The annual cycle of nutrients and chlorophyll a concentrations was monitored at Changdao and Penglai. A sudden depletion of nutrients occurs after spring bloom and is replenished by river discharges from summer to autumn and mixing up from bottom in winter. The concentrations in coastal areas were higher than that in the Central Bohai Sea. The Laizhou Bay and the Central Bohai Sea had the maximum annual mean biomass and primary production, while the Bohai Bay had the lowest values. The Huanghe River, the most turbid one in the world, with large sediment load enters the Bohai Sea and causes the low transparency around its mouth especially during strong wind mixing time. This influences the annual cycle of phytoplankton significantly in that area. Comparing with the historical data of 1982/1983, 1984/1985 and 1992/1993, the annual cycle and horizontal distribution pattern did not change much within two decades. Diatoms and dinoflagellates are the major components of the phytoplankton community in the Bohai Sea and the ecotype of these phytoplankters is temperate and neritic. Nanophytoplankton is a major component and the picophytoplankton is also not negligible. In spring, the phytoplankton community is mainly composed of small cell diatoms and in autumn of big cell diatoms and dinoflagellates. The replacement of diatoms by dinoflagellates is the main feature of phytoplankton changes in recent years. Using DIN, phosphate, phytoplankton and bottom detritus biomass as state variables, a three-dimensional ecosystem model (ECOHAM) is established coupled with the hydrodynamic model (HAMSOM). The simulation was carried out for the year 1982 because hydrodynamic model simulations and meteorological data were available. The simulated nutrients (dissolved inorganic nitrogen [DIN], phosphate), phytoplankton biomass and primary production variability are in reasonable agreement with the observations. Using model results of 1982, the phytoplankton processes could be discussed by model sensitivity studies. The variation of the phytoplankton was controlled by temperature, nutrient and especially by available light, which was strongly influenced by transparency. The annual phytoplankton cycle was sensitive to the basic respiration rate, mortality rate and grazing rate and to the limitation of light. The net primary production of phytoplankton is 7469 kt C. Respiration of phytoplankton take great role in the regeneration of nutrients and it can compensate 62% of the nutrients consumed by algal growth while bottom remineralization, another important source for nutrients regeneration, can add 23%. The influences of horizontal advection, river loads and different biological processes are also discussed based on this model simulation. The maximum of biomass without horizontal advection in summer is two times higher than that with advection and the high biomass area locates along the shore. Transported by horizontal advection, the high biomass area extends to the east in the Laizhou Bay, to the southeast in the Liaodong Bay and concentrates at north in the Bohai Bay. The variation of the river load only has regional influences to the evolution of the system. The increasing of the proliferation of industries, agriculture and domestic sewage compensates the drop of the DIN concentration induced by river load shutdown. If only the phosphorous cycle is considered, the simulated biomass is six times higher and the situation of the Bohai Sea cannot be adequately reproduced. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The sloop of war hms swift (1770): A case study on the effects of biodeterioration on the underwater cultural heritage of patagonia,"Bastida, R.; Elkin, D.; Trassens, M.; Pablo Martin, J.; Grosso, M.","The British sloop of war HMS Swift sank in the Deseado estuary (Santa Cruz, Argentina) on March 13th, 1770. At present this archaeological site constitutes one of the most important South American underwater cultural heritage. The main goal of this work has been to understand the natural. processes which participate in the formation and evolution of underwater sites, with particular emphasis on biodeterioration aspects produced by biofouling communities and marine wood borers. Since both types of organisms have played an important role in the evolution of this site, it has been decided to start experimental assays and periodical monitoring, based on the use of acrylic and wood micro panels. Through these experiments we expect to clarify basic biological and ecological aspects of these communities and their action on several materials and artifacts present at the Swift site. Additionally, we have started some studies on the sedimentary characteristics and on some human impacts on the site.

Environmental interpretation in the great barrier reef marine park: An assessment of programme effectiveness,"Madin, E.M.P.; Fenton, D.M.","This study sought to determine how visitor environmental interpretation programmes in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park could be assessed to determine their effectiveness in educating visitors about the reef environment and conservation issues. A self-administered visitor questionnaire was designed to identify changes in visitor knowledge and understanding of the reef’s basic ecology, human impacts, health and tourism. The study used an independent sample design in which visitors aboard a large reef-trip vessel were surveyed over one week before exposure to the operation’s interpretive programme. A second set of visitors was then surveyed following completion of the interpretive programme. The survey identified significant changes in visitors’ self-reported knowledge of the reef environment as a result of the trip. Additionally, visitors’ self-reported knowledge and understanding of basic reef ecology and human impacts on the reef environment differed significantly in relation to the number of interpretive activities in which they participated. These findings suggest that (1) reef-based visitor interpretation programmes can effectively change visitor understanding of key reef topics and issues, and (2) methods of evaluating reef-based interpretive programmes can be undertaken through self-administered questionnaires. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Environmental sub-regions in the Gulf of Mexico coastal zone: The ecosystem approach as an integrated management tool,"Yáñez-Arancibia, A.; Day, J.W.","Ecological sub-regions are a way of viewing coastal zone (CZ) regions that have been developed to enhance the capability of NGOs, governmental organizations, and academics to assess conditions and trends of the major ecosystems in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf), mainly as a management tool for defining priority actions towards sustainable development. Major ""geographical regions"" at scale-1-level (1:40) are: (a) the warm-temperate Gulf, (b) the tropical Gulf, and (c) the Caribbean coast of Mexico related to the Gulf. At scale-3-level (1:5 million) in region ""A,"" six distinct environmental sub-regions are defined: Western Florida Estuarine Area, Eastern Gulf Neritic, Mississippi Estuarine Area, Texas Estuarine Area, Laguna Madre Estuarine Area, and Western Gulf Neritic. In regions ""B"" and ""C"", 13 distinct environmental sub-regions are defined: Southeast Floridian Neritic, Florida Keys, Florida Bay, Shark River Estuarine Area, Dry Tortugas/Florida Keys Reef Tract, Southwest Floridian Neritic, Veracruzan Neritic, Tabascan Neritic, Campeche Yucatanean Inner Neritic, Campeche Yucatanean Outer Neritic, Contoyan Neritic, Cancunean Neritic, and SianKa'anean Neritic. From a ""hydrological units"" focus, five main sub-regions are defined: (a) The western Florida rivers and ground-water discharge system, (b) The Mississippi River basin and delta, (c) The Texas estuaries and Laguna Madre US-Mexico integrated by the Rio Bravo delta, (d) The Usumacinta/Grijalva River basin and delta, and (e) The Rio Hondo-Chetumal Bay in the Caribbean coast of Mexico. Each ""geographical/hydrological"" sub-region can be viewed as a discrete system which results from the interaction of geologic, geomorphologic, oceanographic, climatic, freshwater drainage, physical, chemical, coastal vegetation, wildlife, estuary-shelf interactions, and human factors. The ecosystem approach adopted as a management tool for environmental sub-regions is predicated on: (a) accepting that interactions between the environment (atmosphere, water, land, biota) and human activities (social, cultural, economics) are inseparable, (b) realizing that humans are the major driving forces behind most ecological change, (c) recognizing environmental thresholds and their importance and linkages to human activities, (d) incorporating the needs of current and future generations, and e) implementing a long-term perspective that is anticipatory, preventative, and sustainable. We suggest for each sub-region to develop key agenda-topics to strengthen ICM and answer questions on, e.g., (a) controls of primary production and water fertility in the coastal zone, (b) energetic pulsing as the basis for sustainable management, (c) vulnerability of the coastal zone to global climatic change, (d) coastal wetlands restoration, and (e) environmental sustainability and the economic development of the coastal zone. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A critical assessment of the system of rice intensification (SRI),"Dobermann, A.","The system of rice intensification (SRI) has been proposed as an integrated and agroecologically sound approach to rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation. It was mainly developed through participatory on-farm research conducted in Madagascar, but its evaluation is ongoing in Asia as well. This paper critically discusses some of the assumptions underlying the SRI and its scope for improving rice production in Asia. A review of cropping practices at known high-yield sites showed that techniques such as SRI are not necessary for growing rice near the yield potential. A move from permanent flooding to intermittent irrigation bears short- and long-term risks that are not well understood, but non-flooded conditions will generally favor rice growth on poor soils with potential for Fe toxicity. Deep root systems are associated with low input rice cropping and the intermittent water management practiced in SRI, but they are not a necessity for maximum rice performance, particularly in favorable environments with intensive cropping, short growth duration, and good water and nitrogen management. Approaches such as SRI may serve the important needs of resource-poor farmers in areas with poor soils, but are likely to have little potential for improving rice production in intensive irrigated systems on more favorable soils, where high yields can be achieved through implementation of more cost-efficient management practices. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Diabetes education and knowledge in patients with type 2 diabetes from the community: The Fremantle Diabetes Study,"Bruce, D.G.; Davis, W.A.; Cull, C.A.; Davis, T.M.E.","Background: Diabetic patients obtain knowledge of the condition from a variety of sources. These include education programs and encounters with health-care staff such as during instruction on self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Objective: To assess whether diabetes knowledge is related to prior attendance at diabetes education programs, visits to dieticians or the current use of SMBG in a community-based cohort of subjects with type 2 diabetes. Patients: 1264 type 2 patients from the Fremantle Diabetes Study (FDS) cohort. Methods: Subjects answered 15 standard multiple-choice questions about diabetes and its management. Recall of past diabetes education, dietician consultations, and use of SMBG were recorded. Analysis of variance was used to determine whether these activities or other social and demographic factors predicted diabetes knowledge. Results: Attendance at education programs, visits to dieticians, and SMBG were independently associated with greater diabetes knowledge. Subjects who were older, whose schooling was limited, who were not fluent in English and/or who were from Southern European or indigenous Australian ethnic groups had significantly lower knowledge scores. Patients who were older, not fluent in English or from an indigenous Australian background were significantly less likely to have received diabetes education, dietetic advice or to be performing SMBG. Conclusions: Diabetes education programs, diabetes-related visits to dieticians and SMBG are associated with, and may be important sources of, improved diabetes knowledge in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our data provide evidence that barriers to access or utilization of contemporary diabetes education confront older patients, minority groups and those with language difficulties.

"Fishermen perception on resources management and aquaculture development in the Mecoacan estuary, Tabasco, Mexico","Pérez-Sánchez, E.; Muir, J.F.","The southern Mexican states on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico produce approximately 85% of the total national oil production. The region has also attracted attention due its important economic influence in terms of fisheries, aquaculture and agriculture, and for its ecosystem diversity. The justification for more integrated approaches to aquaculture development is significant, as coastal aquaculture has brought economic and employment benefits to both national economies and coastal people. The aim of this study is the analysis of Mecoacan fishing communities' perception on coastal resources management and to assess group awareness of the potential benefits and impacts of coastal aquaculture. Although aquaculture practices have been implemented as an alternative to fishing and to improve current levels of fisheries production, the results showed that conditions within Mecoacan fisheries have deteriorated significantly, as collective aggregation is not producing a positive outcome for the local communities. However, fishermen regarded the restructuring of fishing organisations as a means of integrating employment and income generation alternatives such as aquaculture practices. Therefore, a key to success will be to demonstrate the ability of good coastal management to promote capacity building within coastal communities in the context of a participatory intervention strategy through formal and informal organisations. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

An Exploration of the Experiences of Cultural Safety Educators in New Zealand: An Action Research Approach,"Wepa, D.","This research is a study of the experiences of four cultural safety educators in nursing education in Aotearoa, New Zealand. Action research methods assisted the participants to implement change in their practice and gain positive personal involvement in the study. Reflective diaries provided the major tool in this process as participants were able to achieve at least one action research cycle by identifying issues, planning action, observing the action, and reflecting. The findings of the research revealed that the participants not only coped with everyday stressors of teaching but were also required to formulate knowledge for cultural safety. For the Maori participants, their stress was confounded with recruiting and retaining Maori students and macro issues such as commitment to their iwi (tribe). Lack of support to teach cultural safety was identified to be a key theme for all participants. An analysis of this theme revealed that many issues were organizational in nature and out of their control. Action research provided a change strategy for participants to have a sense of control of issues within their practice. Recommendations include the following: support for cultural safety educators to have a dialogue on a regular basis, the introduction of nurse educator programmes, paid leave provisions for educators to conduct and publish research so that a body of knowledge can be developed, and that Maori cultural safety educators be recognised for their professional and cultural strengths so that they do not fall victim to burnout. © 2003, SAGE Publications.

Critical evaluation of CROSERF test methods for oil dispersant toxicity testing under subarctic conditions,"Barron, M.G.; Ka'aihue, L.","The aquatic organism toxicity testing protocols developed by the Chemical Response to Oil Spills: Ecological Research Forum (CROSERF) were evaluated for applicability to assessing chemical dispersant toxicity under subarctic conditions. CROSERF participants developed aquatic toxicity testing protocols with the foremost objective of standardizing test methods and reducing inter-laboratory variability. A number of refinements are recommended to adapt the CROSERF protocols for testing with subarctic species under conditions of expected longer oil persistence. Recommended refinements of the CROSERF protocols include testing fresh and moderately weathered oil under conditions of moderate mixing energy, preparing toxicity test solutions using variable dilutions rather than variable loading, performing tests with subarctic species using static exposures in open chambers, increasing the duration of tests from 4 to 7 days, quantifying approximately 40 PAHs and their alkyl homologs, assessing the potential for photoenhanced toxicity, and incorporating a bioaccumulation endpoint by measuring tissue concentrations of PAHs. Refinements in the preparation of oil dosing solutions, exposure and light regimes, and analytical chemistry should increase the utility of the test results for interpreting the toxicity of chemically dispersed oil and making risk management decisions regarding dispersant use under subarctic conditions. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in fisheries management in Mexico: Effects of increasing scientific input and public participation,"Hernandez, A.; Kempton, W.","In this article, we analyze a change in the role of federal institutions in charge of managing Mexican fisheries during the mid-1990s. During 30 years, the fishery policy in Mexico began by promoting an accelerated fishing effort. This worked through 1981, when the country recorded its highest landings (1.6 million metric tons), but landings have not increased subsequently whereas the number of fishermen has continued to increase. In 1995, the federal administration acknowledged the problems: biological over-exploitation; over-capitalization; monopoly in commercialization; failures in loan payments; failures in controlling effort; obsolete vessels and equipment; and social conflicts for the resources. In an attempt to resolve some of these problems, the administration implemented structural changes in management, science and enforcement institutions. This arrangement established goals and introduced instruments in fisheries management: it determined the biological status of most of the fisheries; applied the precautionary approach for those fully exploited or over-exploited fisheries; gave scientific advice an important role in decision making; and involved the users in decision making. This article evaluates these changes in management policy by document review, participation and interviewing management and scientists who participated in this process. We analyze, in particular, the use of science-based categorization of fisheries status, and the introduction of public participation. The interview data demonstrate that sustainable Mexican fisheries require an evolution to a more public participatory policy, in order to strengthen local institutions and fishermen over federal institutions, which should lead to a redefinition of regulation of fisheries resources. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Identifying potential marine pests - A deductive approach applied to Australia,"Hayes, K.R.; Sliwa, C.","Introduced marine organisms continue to threaten coastal resources around the world. Many agencies rely on lists of potentially harmful species for risk assessment and to prioritise management responses to an incursion. This study outlines a deductive hazard assessment technique to identify potential marine pests that may arrive via ballast water and/or hull fouling. This technique is then applied in an Australian context to identify potential ""next pests"" for this region. An extensive literature review identified 851 introduced marine species from around the world. The following selection criteria were then applied to develop a next pest list: (a) the species has been reported in a shipping vector or has a ship-mediated invasion history; (b) the vector still exists; (c) the species is responsible for economic or environmental harm; and, (d) it is exotic to Australia or present in Australia but subject to official control. The selection criteria are transparent and consistent with other international and national biosecurity initiatives.

1 The EU/INCO-DC project: Impacts of environmental forcing on marine biodiversity & sustainable management of artisanal & industrial fisheries in the gulf of guinea,"McGlade, J.M.; Koranteng, K.A.; Cury, P.","The European Union Gulf of Guinea collaborative research project on the impacts of environmental forcing on marine biodiversity was supported by the International Cooperation with Developing Countries Programme (INCO-DC). It was a natural sequel to three earlier international research projects on environmental variability and pelagic fishery resources in West Africa (Cury and Roy 1991; Bard and Koranteng 1995; Durand et al. 1998). At its conclusion, the project was able to provide an assessment of the impacts of upwelling and other forms of environmental forcing on marine biodiversity, with particular reference to demersal fish, and the basis for a fisheries information and analysis system for the sustainable management of fisheries in West Africa. It also facilitated the retrieval of important fisheries and survey data that had previously been inaccessible to scientists in the region. The major achievements of the project were presented at an international workshop on ""Sustainable Management of the Fish Resources in the Gulf of Guinea"" held in Accra in 1998. © 2002 Elsevier B.V.

Indian aerosols: Present status,"Mitra, A.P.; Sharma, C.","This article presents the status of aerosols in India based on the research activities undertaken during last few decades in this region. Programs, like International Geophysical Year (IGY), Monsoon Experiment (MONEX), Indian Middle Atmospheric Program (IMAP) and recently conducted Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), have thrown new lights on the role of aerosols in global change. INDOEX has proved that the effects of aerosols are no longer confined to the local levels but extend at regional as well as global scales due to occurrence of long range transportation of aerosols from source regions along with wind trajectories. The loading of aerosols in the atmosphere is on rising due to energy intensive activities for developmental processes and other anthropogenic activities. One of the significant observation of INDOEX is the presence of high concentrations of carbonaceous aerosols in the near persistent winter time haze layer over tropical Indian Ocean which have probably been emitted from the burning of fossil-fuels and biofuels in the source region. These have significant bearing on the radiative forcing in the region and, therefore, have potential to alter monsoon and hydrological cycles. In general, the SPM concentrations have been found to be on higher sides in ambient atmosphere in many Indian cities but the NOx concentrations have been found to be on lower side. Even in the haze layer over Indian Ocean and surrounding areas, the NOx concentrations have been reported to be low which is not conducive of O3 formation in the haze/smog layer. The acid rain problem does not seem to exist at the moment in India because of the presence of neutralizing soil dust in the atmosphere. But the high particulate concentrations in most of the cities' atmosphere in India are of concern as it can cause deteriorated health conditions. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Mathematical modeling of PCB bioaccumulation in Perna viridis,"Yu, K.N.; Lam, P.K.S.; Cheung, C.C.C.; Yip, C.W.Y.","In the present work, we built a mathematical model of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) bioaccumulation in Perna viridis, namely, a one-compartment model with a time dependent incorporation rate R (μgg-1 lipid per ppb water per day), with positive substrate cooperativity as the underlying physical mechanism. The temporal change of the PCB concentration Q (μgg-1 lipid) in the soft tissues of the mussel depends on the competition of the input rate RW and the output rate kQ, where W is the concentration of PCB in water (ppb water) and k is the elimination rate (per day). From our experimental data, k=0.181±0.017 d-1. The critical concentration in water Wc for positive substrate cooperativity was found to be ∼2.4 ppb. Below Wc, R is a constant. For a water concentration of 0.5 ppb Aroclor 1254, R=24.0±2.4 μgg-1 lipid ppb-1d-1. Above Wc, positive substrate cooperativity comes into effect and R becomes a function of time and dependent on the concentration Q in a form R=γQ/(Q+δ). This is the case for a water concentration of 5 ppb Aroclor 1254, where γ=15.1 μgg-1 lipid ppb-1d1 and δ≈200 μgg-1 lipid. From this model, the uptake is exponentially increasing when the PCB concentration in the mussel is small compared to 200 μgg-1 lipid, and hyperbolically increasing when the concentration is large compared to 200 μgg-1 lipid, which are consistent with the experimental data. The model is useful for understanding the true processes taking place during the bioaccumulation and for risk assessment with higher confidence. Future experimental data which challenge the present model are anticipated and in fact desirable for improvement and perfection of the model. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"Marine protected area strategies: Issues, divergences and the search for middle ground","Jones, P.J.S.","There has been a dramatic increase in recent years in the number of papers, reports, etc., which have been published concerning Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This overview of the objectives, selection, design and management of MPAs aims to provide a basis for discussion regarding possible ways forward by identifying emerging issues, convergences and divergences. Whilst the attributes of the marine environment may limit the effectiveness of sitespecific initiatives such as MPAs, it is argued that it would be defeatist in the extreme to abandon MPAs in the face of these limitations. Ten key objectives for MPAs are discussed, including that of harvest refugia, and it is argued that whilst these objectives may be justifiable from a preservationist perspective, they may be objected to from a resource exploitation perspective. MPAs generate both internal (between uses) and basic (between use and conservation) conflicts, and it is argued that these conflicts may be exacerbated when scientific arguments for MPAs are motivated by preservationist concerns. It is reported that a minority of MPAs are achieving their management objectives, and that for the majority insufficient information was available for such effectiveness evaluations. Structure and process-oriented perspective on marine conservation are discussed. It is argued that there are two divergent stances concerning optimal MPA management approaches: top-down, characterized as being government-led and science-based, with a greater emphasis on set-aside; and bottom-up, characterized as being community-based and science-guided, with a greater emphasis on multiple-use. Given the divergent values of different stakeholders, the high degree of scientific uncertainty, and the high marine resource management decision stakes, it is concluded that a key challenge is to adopt a ""middle-ground"" approach which combines top-down and bottom-up approaches, and which is consistent with the post-normal scientific approach.",2002,,Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries,11,3,197-216,,10.1023/A:1020327007975,,#21462,Jones 2002,,
Problems of marine mammal conservation in Southeast Asia,"Perrin, W.F.","The marine mammal fauna of Southeast Asia consists of approximately 30 species, about ¼ of the world's species, and includes several endemic species or subspecies. Examples of problems of conservation include bycatch in a tuna driftnet fishery, inshore habitat degradation, and depletion of humpback whales in the Philippines; possible disappearance of dolphins and porpoises from the Mekong Delta in Vietnam; and depletion of riverine dolphins and large bycatch in a shark fishery in Indonesia. Major causative factors include over-fishing, human overpopulation, development, vulnerability of marine mammals, and evolution of bycatch into directed dolphin fisheries. Needs are for inventory (stock identification and abundance estimation), bycatch monitoring, reduction of takes to sustainable levels, and regional international cooperation. © 2002, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Photosynthesis below the surface in a cryptic microbial mat,"Rothschild, L.J.; Giver, L.J.","The discovery of subsurface communities has encouraged speculation that such communities might be present on planetary bodies exposed to harsh surface conditions, including the early Earth. While the astrobiology community has focused on the deep subsurface, near-subsurface environments are unique in that they provide some protection while allowing partial access to photosynthetically active radiation. Previously we identified near-surface microbial communities based on photosynthesis. Here we assess the productivity of such an ecosystem by measuring in situ carbon fixation rates in an intertidal marine beach through a diurnal cycle, and find them surprisingly productive. Gross fixation along a transect (99×1 m) perpendicular to the shore was highly variable and depended on factors such as moisture and mat type, with a mean of ~41 mg C fixed m−2 day−1. In contrast, an adjacent well-established cyanobacterial mat dominated by Lyngbya aestuarii was ~12 times as productive (~500 mg C fixed m−2 day−1). Measurements made of the Lyngbya mat at several times per year revealed a correlation between total hours of daylight and gross daily production. From these data, annual gross fixation was estimated for the Lyngbya mat and yielded a value of ~1.3×105 g m−2 yr−1. An analysis of pulse-chase data obtained in the study in conjunction with published literature on similar ecosystems suggests that subsurface interstitial mats may be an overlooked endogenous source of organic carbon, mostly in the form of excreted fixed carbon. © 2002, Cambridge University Press.

A trial application of FSA methodology to the hatchway watertight integrity of bulk carriers,"Lee, J.-O.; Yeo, I.-C.; Yang, Y.-S.","Formal safety assessment (FSA) is a formal, structured and systematic methodology, aimed at enhancing maritime safety, including protection of life, property and marine environment, by using risk and cost-benefit assessments.

Marine reserves and the restoration of fisheries and marine ecosystems in the South China Sea,"Pitcher, T.J.; Watson, R.; Haggan, N.; Guénette, S.; Kennish, R.; Sumaila, U.R.; Cook, D.; Wilson, K.; Leung, A.","The South China Sea has been devastated by human fishing. This paper reports an initiative to restore Hong Kong's marine ecosystems and fisheries through the deployment of artificial reefs (ARs) within marine protected areas (MPAs). Current catch and biomass data by species and fishery sector were available. Quasi-spatial ecosystem simulations, using a modified ECOSIM method, have been employed to forecast benefits from a successful MPA/AR system. Results indicate that, despite increasing fishing power in the Hong Kong fleet, a 10-20% MPA/AR system could provide significant benefits within 10 yrs, and shifts to low-value pelagic fish could be reversed. Approximate scores, expressing how species benefit from protected ARs, suggest that results are not biased by changes in species composition. The design of MPA/ARs balances island biogeographic theory with the needs of monitoring and compliance: minimizing perimeter losses and establishing colonizing corridors are trade-offs with statistical replication and monitoring, whereas sacrifice of some ARs to fishing encourages compliance and learning. In Hong Kong, workshops with fishing communities encouraged support. Bioeconomic analysis shows an MPA/AR system increasing fishery value, but noncompliance rapidly erodes benefits. The benefits of this approach are assessed together with problems and difficulties that have arisen.",2000,,Bulletin of Marine Science,66,3,543-566,,,,#21493,Pitcher 2000,,
Timing of exogenous surfactant administration in clinical practice Report of a multi-center Italian Observational Study,"Bevilacqua, G.","Study participants (in alphabetical order of places) Viviana Marinelli, Daniela Rosatelli (Università - Cagliari), Giovanna Policicchio, Carlo Zorzi (Ospedali, Camposanpiero - PD), Carlo Dani (Università - Firenze), Vincenzo Cordaro, Eloisia Gitto ( Università - Messina), Silvana Grano ( II Università - NapoIi),Pier Alessandro Monici Preti, Fabrizio Gardini, Guido Varoli (Chiesi Farmaceutici - Parma), Giovanna Bussolati, Ciro Capuano, (Università Parma), Federica Vagnarelli, Cristiana Magnani (Ospale- Reggio Emilia), Giuseppe De Nisi, Alberta Valente (Ospedale-Trento), Italo Bernardo (Ospedali- Caserta), Bartolomeo Spinella, Raffaele Pomo (Ospedale Buccheri-Palermo), Costantino Romagnoli, Maria Pia De Carolis (Università Cattolica-Roma), Ezio Padovani (Università-Verona). We now have convincing data that surfactant administration in newborns with the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is effective in reducing the need for respiratory supports and improves the clinical outcomes. To evaluate the different strategies adopted in clinical practice for the surfactant use we performed an observational multicenter study. All newborns with gestational age (g.a.) between 24-32 wk. with RDS and that were in need of mechanical ventilation and treated with exogenous surfactant from 1994 to 1996 in twelve Neonatal Intensive Care Units have been evaluated. The patients have been divided into two groups: one includes babies that were given surfactant within the first 15 minutes of life (very early -VE- treated) and the other includes those that received the treatment at age 16- 180 minutes (early -E- treated). The analysis concerned 246 cases, 54 VE treated and 192 E treated. The two groups were comparable with regards to sex, Apgar score at one and five minutes, maternal treatment with steroids and multiple pregnancy. Mean birth weight and g.a. were significantly lower and the rate of caesarean sections was higher in the VE than in the E. Almost 80% of the VE newborns had a g.a. equal or less than 28 wks. One single dose of surfactant was administered in 77.8% of VE babies and 45.3 % in the E group, while 18.5% VE and 36.8% E received two doses, 3.7% VE and 16.3% E were given three doses. The mean number of doses used per patient was 1.3 in VE and 1.7 in E. 62.5% of cases with g.a. equal to or less than 26 wks and 80.8% of those with g.a. 27-28 wk. received a single dose if VE, compared to 31,9% and 49,1% respectively if E treated. Prenatal prophylaxis of RDS with steroids, considering only the mothers that received a complete course between 48 hrs and 7 days before the delivery, did not modify the number of doses of surfactant required in both groups. The main outcomes did not differ in the two groups: mortality at 28 days of life, age at death, pneumothorax, intraventricular haemorrhage grade 3-4, retinopathy of prematurity grade 3-4, patent ductus arteriosus and oxygen dependency at 36 wks post-conceptional age. Conclusions: Very early surfactant administration in clinical practice reserved for newborns with the lowest g.a., improves the outcome and does not increase surfactant consumption.",2000,,Acta Biomedica de l'Ateneo Parmense,71,SUPPL. 1,421-429,,,,#21494,Bevilacqua 2000,,
Philippine coral reefs under threat: The economic losses caused by reef destruction,"White, A.T.; Vogt, H.P.; Arin, T.","In the Philippines, coral reef fisheries provide livelihood for more than a million small-scale fishers who contribute almost US$ 1 billion annually to the country's economy. The rapidly growing population needs increasing amounts of fish and other marine organisms. However, overfishing, destructive fishing methods and sedimentation have damaged or destroyed many reef areas. Fish catches have fallen well below the sustainable levels of healthy reefs. The economic losses to the coastal fishing population are considerable. Various programmes have and are trying to counter coral reef decline by establishing sustainable management regimes. The economic benefits of such programmes appear to exceed their investment costs. As an example, the start-up and maintenance costs of a successful island marine reserve project have been compared to the losses caused by reef destruction and the gains from reef management. The results clearly show that the economic benefits from a managed reef area due to higher catches and revenue from small-scale tourism far exceed costs. Coral reefs are also a major attraction for an increasing number of local and international tourists. In addition to providing income for the tourism industry, these reef visitors are often willing to contribute to the costs for reef management. The annual willingness-to-pay assessed in three popular diving destinations are significant. An estimated US$ 300000 could be collected annually as entrance fees or donations in Mabini, Batangas alone. It is estimated that the 27000 km2 of reef in their degraded condition still contribute at least US$ 1.35 billion annually to the economy. Reef management involving local fishing communities, local governments and other concerned organizations is a cost-effective way to alleviate the pressure on the numerous threatened coral reefs. In addition, economic valuation and cost-benefit analysis can provide essential information to support more investment in reef conservation.

The regime will require an arrangement that delivers high-quality scientific advice. But regional science arrangements have often developed without the benefit of planning and without close attention to management requirements. We use the western and central Pacific fishery to highlight the types of science functions and attributes required for effective regional fishery management. In establishing science arrangements, nations will need to balance national interests, such as participation in stock assessments, against the wider interests of resource management which requires unbiased scientific advice.

The Dutch Antilles,"Debrot, A.O.; Sybesma, J.","The six islands and offshore Saba Bank which make up the Dutch Antilles lie in the Caribbean Sea. The principal marine littoral habitats are coral reefs, seagrass beds, algal beds, mangroves and salt ponds, all of which have been only partially inventoried and mapped, so that few baseline data exist for most islands. Only scattered documentation exists on marine pollution loads and resource use pressure. Nevertheless, indications are that the current magnitude of coastal development and industrial pollution in Aruba, Curacao and St. Maarten have already reached such proportions that large tracts of reef and related coastal habitats are being rapidly degraded. Major problem areas identified for the various islands are: pollution caused by oil refineries; sewage discharge and eutrophication of coastal waters; beach tar and litter contamination; erosion due to overgrazing and poor real-estate development practices; overfishing; municipal landfills which form a long-term threat; and unregulated coastal urbanization. Several islands have extensive areas which are vulnerable to hurricane wave damage and long-term sea-level rise. Governmental efforts towards a more coherent environmental development policy only began in 1992 with the Rio Conference. In 1996 the Netherlands Antilles Ministry of Public Health and Environment published a framework for environmental policy, and in 1998 a legal framework was established for nature management and conservation. Recent decades have seen significant advances, particularly in nature conservation, which have largely been driven by 'governmental NGO' national park management foundations. Nevertheless, on the whole, current environmental legislation remains deficient and fragmentary and fails to adequately address most major issues. Also, government investment in environmental matters remains minimal, notwithstanding high GNPs and standards of living by regional comparison. None of the islands have as yet developed any vision of the greater issue of population size which drives most economic, infrastructural and environmental problems. A recent assessment by ECLAC (Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean) identifies the establishment of good governance as the main priority for the implementation of sound environmental policy in the Netherlands Antilles. This is followed by institutional capacity building, and policy and legislation development, whereby public awareness and participation are recommended as key elements of strategy. The chance that the various problems will effectively be dealt with in the near future differs between islands. We predict that the less populous islands (Saba, St. Eustatius, Bonaire) where population pressure is less, the economies are simpler and more ecotouristically oriented, and where government is less complex, show the greatest promise in being able to deal effectively with environmental issues. We further predict that issues such as rampant coastal urbanization, fishing pressure and pollution by the petroleum sector (and other large enterprises) are not likely to be dealt with effectively in the foreseeable future on most islands, notwithstanding the many management plans and the various initiatives towards policy development in these areas.",2000,,Seas at the millennium - an environmental evaluation - Volume 1,,,595-614,,,,#21499,Debrot 2000,,
Vanuatu,"Vuki, V.C.; Appana, S.; Naqasima, M.R.; Vuki, M.","This chapter reviews and assesses the condition of the marine environment in Vanuatu mainly from unpublished sources. It is in generally very good condition. However, severe damage from cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks have caused considerable damage to reefs in recent years, and reefs near major population centres show signs of degradation. Some reefs are threatened by increased siltation from logging in catchment areas, nutrient enrichment from sewage pollution and from over-exploitation of reef fish. Sewage disposal, domestic and solid wastes are serious environmental concerns in urban areas and, as a result, water quality is generally poor. There are generally no refuse dumps in many rural areas, and beaches, streams and lagoons are heavily littered. Industrial marine pollutant loadings appear to be increasing. Trochus, green snails and land crabs (Birgus latro) have declined because of high rates of exploitation and the giant clam, Tridacna gigas, has been driven into extinction through excessive harvesting in Vanuatu. Turtles and dugongs are endangered and are sensitive to over-hunting. The huge leatherback turtle which also occurs here is threatened with extinction because of egg collection. Seabirds have also been significantly depleted through egg collection at rookeries and through disturbance of nesting sites through clearing. There is limited management of the marine environment in Vanuatu and very little environmental awareness, technical or financial resources for this. Recent marine awareness-raising through workshops, drama, radio broadcasts has been successful in establishing community-based marine sanctuaries for replenishing overfished trochus and giant clams. Some village-based fishing restrictions on fishing methods, fishing ground closures and size restrictions have been initiated and implemented. But there is generally a lack of finances and technical expertise to support monitoring programmes or to implement and enforce legislation and policies pertaining to the marine environment. Vanuatu has declared a moderate number of marine protected areas (MPA) but the involvement of customary fishing right owners is integral to the success of MPAs in Vanuatu. These MPAs are an important strategy to conserve marine biodiversity in the absence of scientific knowledge and monitoring.",2000,,Seas at the millennium - an environmental evaluation - Volume 2,,,737-749,,,,#21500,Vuki 2000,,
Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.),"Maragos, J.E.","The Hawaiian Islands are the fifth largest in terms of land area (16,643 km2), and with 1.3 million people, the second most populous of the archipelagos in the tropical Pacific. The principal islands are in two groups: eight large and several smaller volcanic islands in the warmer southeast end of the chain where the human population is concentrated, and very small volcanic and coral islands and atolls to the northwest which are uninhabited or sparsely inhabited. Marine biodiversity is high in terms of habitat quantity, variety, and degree of endemism but lower in terms of species richness. Hawai'i is geographically the most isolated island chain in the world. The people rely heavily on air and sea transportation for maintaining an economy dependent on tourism, military expenditures, and agriculture. The population has expanded rapidly since World War II, with three-fourths residing on O'ahu, and most living in or near the main city of Honolulu. During the earlier part of this century, plantation agriculture (sugar cane, pineapple), ranching, grazing of feral animals, military construction, and transportation projects changed the marine environment via the draining of wetlands, dredging and filling coastal areas, and the flushing of eroded soils. Urbanization now fuels coastal construction, resort and golf course development, increased coastal pollution, coastal flooding, sedimentation, and overfishing in nearshore waters. Alien and invasive species, derelict fishing gear, shark finning, and depletion of fish stocks are now emerging as major marine environmental concerns, along with poorly regulated aquarium fish collection, ship groundings, anchor damage, and overuse of popular coastal parks, beaches, and nearshore reefs. The endemic monk seal and many seabirds are being threatened by commercial fishing off remote reefs. Green sea turtles are afflicted with a poorly understood disease. The incidence of coral bleaching and diseases appears to be increasing, although existing levels are low. Hawai'i contains 84% of all reefs under U.S. jurisdiction, accounting for 17,520 km2 of habitat above a depth of 200 m. The northwest islands account for 82% of the Hawaiian total. Together with adjacent beaches and waters, the reefs support millions of dollars of economic activity, including marine and coastal tourism, sport-fishing, subsistence fishing, commercial fishing, commercial and recreational boating, scientific research, and mariculture development. The coral reefs also afford natural protection and anchorages for boats, and protect coastal property and beaches from the damaging effects of tropical storms and large waves. Extensive local, state, and federal environmental legislation and regulations exist, and there are adequate controls over solid waste, coastal water pollution, further draining or loss of wetlands, and coastal construction. The state and the four county governments, with federal support, have active programs that regulate development in the coastal zone. The network of federal and state marine and coastal protected areas is substantial, especially in the northwest islands. Sustainable fisheries management, increased community-based management of coastal areas in the main islands, public education, additional marine protected areas, and increased monitoring and enforcement pose as the major future challenges for conserving marine ecosystems in Hawai'i.",2000,,Seas at the millennium - an environmental evaluation - Volume 2,,,791-812,,,,#21501,Maragos 2000,,
AMS measurements of 14C and 129I in seawater around radioactive waste dump sites,"Povinec, P.P.; Oregioni, B.; Jull, A.J.T.; Kieser, W.E.; Zhao, X.-L.","According to a recent IAEA compilation of inventories of radioactive wastes dumped in the world ocean, a total of 85 PBq of radioactive wastes were dumped, in the Atlantic (45 PBq), the Pacific (1.4 PBq) and the Arctic (38 PBq) Oceans and their marginal seas between 1946 and 1993, mostly in the form of low-level wastes. 3H and 14C formed an important part of the beta-activity of these dumped wastes. Because of its long half-life, 14C will be the main constituent in possible leakages from the wastes in the future. On the other hand, 14C and 129I are important radioactive tracers which have been artificially introduced into the oceans. Small amounts of 14C and 129I can be easily measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) on mg-size samples of carbon and iodine extracted from 500 ml seawater samples. The high analytical sensitivity enables one therefore to find even trace amounts of 14C and 129I which could be released from radioactive wastes, and to compare the measured levels with the global distribution of these radionuclides. The IAEAs Marine Environment Laboratory (IAEA-MEL) has been engaged in an assessment program related to radioactive waste dumping in the oceans since 1992 and has participated in several expeditions to the Atlantic, Arctic, Indian and Pacific Oceans to sample seawater, biota and sediment for radiological assessment studies. In the present paper, we report on methods of 14C and 129I measurements in seawater by AMS and present data on the NE Atlantic, the Arctic and the NW Pacific Ocean dumping sites.

Connecting onshore and offshore near-surface geology: Delaware's sand inventory project,"Ramsey, K.W.; Jordan, R.R.; Talley, J.H.","Beginning in 1988, the Delaware Geological Survey began a program to inventory on-land sand resources suitable for beach nourishment. The inventory included an assessment of the native beach textures using existing data and developing parameters of what would be considered suitable sand textures for Delaware's Atlantic beaches. An assessment of the economics of on-land sand resources was also conducted, and it was determined that the cost of the sand was competitive with offshore dredging costs. In addition, the sand resources were put into a geologic context for purposes of predicting which depositional environments and lithostrati graphic units were most likely to produce suitable sand resources. The results of the work identified several suitable on-land sand resource areas in the Omar and Beaverdam formations that were deposited in barrier-tidal delta and fluvial-estuarine environments, respectively. The identified on-land resources areas have not been utilized due to difficulties of truck transport and development pressures in the resource areas. The Delaware Geological Survey's participation in years 8, 9, and 10 of the Continental Margins Program was developed to extend the known resource areas onshore to offshore Delaware in order to determine potential offshore sand resources for beach nourishment. Years 8 and 9 involved primarily the collection of all available data on the offshore geology. These data included all seismic lines, surface grab samples, and cores. The data were filtered for those that had reliable locations and geologic information that could be used for geologic investigations. Year 10 completed the investigations onshore by construction of a geologic cross-section from data along the coast of Delaware from Cape Henlopen to Fenwick. This cross section identified the geologic units and potential sand resource bodies as found immediately along the coast. These units and resources are currently being extended offshore and tied to known and potential sand resources as part of the continuing cooperative effort between the Delaware Geological Survey and the Minerals Man agement Service's INTERMAR office as sand resources are identified in federal waters off Delaware. Offshore sand resources are found in the Pliocene Beaverdam Formation offshore where overlying Quaternary units have been stripped, in the tidal delta complexes of several Quaternary units likely equivalent to the onshore Omar Formation, and in late Pleistocene and Holocene-age shoal complexes. Onshore lithostratigraphic units can be traced offshore and show another reason for continued geologic mapping both onshore and offshore. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

"Submarine sand resources, southeastern virginia—contributions from year 9 and year 10 of virginia’s continental margins program","Hobbs, C.H., III; Hardaway, C.S., Jr.; Berquist, C.R., Jr.","Virginia's year 9 and year 10 funds from the Continental Shelf Program were used to supplement other work funded by the Minerals Management Service in an ongoing Cooperative Agreement focused on the area offshore of southeastern Virginia. Year 9 and year 10 funds facilitated interpretation of subbottom profiles and the analysis of sediment samples from cores and grabs. On Virginia's sediment-starved continental shelf, deposits of material potentially suitable for use as beach nourishment or, perhaps, as construction aggregate occur in three stratigraphic settings, each with specific characteristics of morphology, grain-size gradients, likelihood of discovery, and physical ease of exploitation. All must be verified with a careful program of coring. Modern shoals generally are easier to identify, prove, and access than either filled channels or lenticular facies. Shoals usually are identifiable on nautical charts and characteristically have a definite lower boundarythat can be seen in subbottom profiles. In most cases, the base of the shoal coincides with the level of the surrounding sea floor. Filled channels are readily identifiable on subbottom profiles but may have a narrow, sinuous form and steep lateral gradients in sediment properties. Buried lenticular facies of good-quality sand usually are found only fortuitously. As the lateral and often vertical gradients in geotechnical properties usually are low, the lenticular facies can be mined with a lesser concern for the consequences of violating the deposit's limits than with the other two types of deposit. There are three types of filled paleochannels in the study area. (1) Relatively near-surface, generally small, roughly shore normal channels most likely mark the migration of tidal inlets across the shelf during the most recent transgression. (2) Small, relatively wide and relatively shallow generally shore parallel channels may be filled back-barrier or lagoonal channels. (3) Larger channels trending across the shelf probably result from riverine flow. The complexity of the seismostratigraphy of the Quaternary deposits on south eastern Virginia's inner continental shelf is a result of series of high-frequency (fifth-order, 10-20,000 y), low-amplitude (20-30 m) variations in sea level that occurred during the last highstand, roughly 80,000 to 130,000 BP. The evidence of the small oscillations in sea level is best seen in the regions that were between the shoreline and wave base, today's inner shelf; however, the very low rates of deposition on the shelf make it difficult to correlate specific reflectors or beds or, at times, to distinguish between fifth-and fourth-order changes. Results for the continuing studies already have been used in the determination to mine several hundred thousand cubic meters of sand from Sandbridge Shoal for use on a Navy-owned facility and in consideration of mining greater quantities of sand from Sandbridge and other shoals for use in local beach nourishment and hurricane protection efforts. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Is the biomass burning source of CO decreasing?,"Yung, Y.L.; Shia, C.; Herman, R.L.","To investigate secular changes in CO and CH4, we examined monthly means of tropospheric measurements made from samples collected at 19 fixed sites in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) global cooperative flask sampling network. The CH4 data are available for the period 1984-1995. A somewhat shorter time series is available for CO (1989-1995). The data were analyzed to extract a consistent pattern of change in time and in latitude. The most important preliminary finding is that the patterns of CO and CH4 change appear to resemble that of biomass burning. That is, there is maximum change during local spring in both northern and southern hemispheres. If we attribute a significant part of the change in CH4 trend (3-6 ppb/yr) to biomass burning, the corresponding change in CO is approximately 2-5 ppb/yr. This would explain the bulk of the observed change in CO (4-7 ppb/yr). © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Expert system for marine environmental monitoring in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and Florida Bay,"Hendee, James C.","The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA, U.S. Department of Commerce) Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) works cooperatively with the Florida Institute of Oceanography (FIO) in the implementation of the SEAKEYS (Sustained Ecological Research Related to Management of the Florida Keys Seascape) network, which is situated along 220 miles of coral reef tract within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS). This network is itself actually an enhanced framework of seven Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) stations for long-term monitoring of meteorological parameters (wind speed, wind gusts, air temperature, barometric pressure, relative humidity). To the C-MAN network SEAKEYS adds oceanographic parameters (sea temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, salinity, fluorometry, optical density) to the stations. As a recent enhancement to the SEAKEYS network, an expert system shell is being employed to provide daily interpretations of near real-time acquired data for the benefit of scientists, fishermen and skin divers. These interpretations are designed to be automatically emailed to Sanctuary managers and to the FIO maintainers of the network.

HPLC analysis of algal pigments: A comparison exercise among laboratories and recommendations for improved analytical performance,"Latasa, M.; Bidigare, R.R.; Ondrusek, M.E.; Kennicutt II, M.C.","Pure individual and mixed pigment standards were distributed among Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) pigment analysts to estimate the variability of their spectrophotometric and chromatographic systems. To monitor the integrity of the pigments during the comparison exercise, chlorophyll and carotenoid standards were archived and periodically analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Pigment standards stored in the dark under nitrogen at -20°C were found to be stable for periods of at least one year. Results from three separate intercalibration exercises document a better agreement for spectrophotometric analyses than for HPLC. For the spectrophotometric comparisons, 90% of the pigments analyzed by participant laboratories were within ±6% of the mean ""consensus"" values. By contrast, 65 and 85% of the laboratories agreed to within ±10 and ± 20%, respectively, when chromatographic analyses were compared. Chlorophyll absorption measurements obtained with a diode array-type spectrophotometer were 6-9% lower than those obtained with monochromator-type spectrophotometers. These underestimates probably result from chlorophyll fluorescence contamination associated with the optical configuration of the diode array spectrophotometer. It was also determined that HPLC methods which are not capable of separating monovinyl chlorophyll a from divinyl chlorophyll a can produce 15-25% overestimates of total chlorophyll a concentration in Prochlorococcus-dominated oceanic waters. A simple dichromatic approach is described for eliminating this variable source of error caused by co-elution of these structurally-related pigments. The use of internal standards and periodic calibration checks with external standards is highly recommended for improving analytical performance. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

The united states and the new law of the sea,"Joyner, C.C.","This article examines the objections by the United States to the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention and explains why the government rejected a treaty that it had worked so long and hard to produce. This study also evaluates UN efforts since 1990 to reconcile international difficulties over seabed mining. The focus here falls on how deep seabed provisions of the 1982 text were revised to render the Convention more acceptable to the United States. Certain lessons for multilateral negotiations from the protracted law of the sea experience are also proffered, especially how circumstances of time, economics, politics, and personalities can affect the outcomes of complex international negotiations. Finally, the 1994 Implementation Agreement is assessed. The conclusion is that this Agreement makes notable improvements benefitting U.S. interests as a principal ocean miner. It replaces an overly detailed and costly regime in Part XI of the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention text with a more streamlined approach to deep seabed mining; it allows for institutional development of a commercial recovery management regime that is more consistent with free market principles; it establishes principles of cost‐efficiency, nondiscrimination, and functional necessity as bases for actions under the Agreement; it places the Enterprise on a more equal basis with private contractors; it replaces mandatory technology transfer to the Enterprise with provisions for greater cooperation and more effective protection of intellectual property rights. Finally, the Implementation Agreement establishes a voting system within the Authority that allocates greater influence to the United States as a decision‐maker as well as greater security of its political and economic interests. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Determinants of HIV risk among men who have homosexual sex and inject drugs,"crofts, N.; meade, J.; marcus, L.; sattler, G.; wallace, J.; sharp, R.","Men with histories of both homosexual contact and injecting drug use (IDU) are at increased risk of HIV infection over men who have only one such risk. Despite this, their special needs and circumstances have been neglected by AIDS prevention programmes. A survey of a wide spectrum of homosexual male IDUs was carried out in Melbourne and Sydney in 1993 to inform the development of specific policy and programmes for HIV prevention in these subcultures. Of 169 men, self-reported HIV prevalence was 27%. Decreasing compliance with safe sex guidelines (as measured by numbers of casual partners, participation in anal intercourse and use of condoms) was associated with HIV seropositivity, increased age, and increased participation in sex work; having a regular male partner was not protective against unsafe sexual behaviour, no matter the length of the relationship. A substantial proportion (15%) reported inconsistent condom use during anal sex with more than two partners in the preceding month: they were slightly more likely to be engaging in sex work, less ‘stable’ and more likely to be HIV infected. Sexual risk was not strongly associated with unsafe injecting, which was in general safe. Men who both have homosexual sex and inject drugs are groups at high risk of HIV, more from unsafe sex than from shared injecting equipment; men who believed themselves to be HIV infected were continuing to have sex in such a way that would allow transmission. These are clearly groups in need of priority targeted interventions. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Indigenous Resource Management and Sustainable Development: Case Studies from Papua New Guinea and Indonesia,"Akimichi, T.","In tropical waters reefs provide local populations with food as well as with a source of income.

The cases of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia are examined to evaluate the roles of customary practices under rapidly changing socio-economic conditions. In Maluku, eastern Indonesia, harvesting of coconut, sago, trepang, trochus, and reef fish is controlled by sasi, community-based resource management practices, under prior authorization by the head of local government. In Manus, Papua New Guinea, reefs are exclusively claimed and used by certain clan members. Disputes over reef ownership are resolved through either informal compromise between local groups or judgment in the local court, which gives customary practices top priority.

"Tourism and waterfront renewal: assessing residential perception in Newport, Rhode Island, USA","Krausse, G.H.","The purpose of this study is to examine the perception of harbor residents on tourism and waterfront redevelopments in Newport, Rhode Island. In the summer of 1992, about 160 surveys were conducted of households located directly in the tourism district. The results indicate that by and large the waterfront community perceives the current traffic conditions, inadequate parking, lack of privacy, and commercial intrusion into neighborhoods to be the consequences of increased tourism. Negative attitudes towards waterfront renewal are associated with perceived difficulties in having access to the water, lack of affordable housing, continued marine pollution, and the proliferation of non-water-dependent uses in the harbor. Conversely, several favorable reactions raised by residents included increased property values, successful historic preservation, and the participation in tourist-related events and amenities. Despite their geographic proximity to the business district, the development activities on the waterfront and the opportunities generated by tourism, few residents feel they have benefited economically from these advantages. Currently, the political climate in Newport is such that a comprehensive harbor management plan can become a reality. It is hoped that residents will then have an opportunity to incorporate their issues into policies of the plan. © 1995.",1995,,Ocean and Coastal Management,26,3,179-203,,10.1016/0964-5691(95)00016-U,,#21529,Krausse 1995,,
Preliminary Observations on the Marketability of Saltwater‐Cultured Florida Red Tilapia in Puerto Rico,"Head, W.D.; Zerbi, A.; Watanabe, W.O.","A preliminary assessment of the marketability of saltwatercultured Florida red tilapia was conducted at a farm outlet store and at nine restaurants in Puerto Rico. Florida red tilapia were grown in six 0.2‐ha ponds at 22.7 ± 1.2 (mean ± SE) ppt salinity by a commercial aquaculture enterprise in Dorado, northeastern Puerto Rico. Customers purchased 4,683kg of dressed‐out fish (gilled, gutted and scaled) at $7.70/kg and 826kg of whole fish at $6.60/kg from a retail outlet store located at the aquaculture farm, and nine restaurants purchased 1,071kg of dressed‐out fish at wholesale prices ranging from $4.96 to $5.18/kg. Farm outlet customers and restaurants preferred dressed‐out fish between 454–567g and 567–580g, respectively. Prices paid per serving by restaurant customers for red tilapia ($7.00–$25.00) were similar to that paid for silk snapper Lutjanus vivanus, a popular marine food fish in Puerto Rico. Market surveys of customers at these outlets showed that 75–81% of the respondents were new consumers of red tilapia and that they rated red tilapia highly in taste, texture, freshness, and presentation and equal to or better than silk snapper. There was no effect (P > 0.05) of age group or economic level on consumer responses. Survey participants stressed the need for product promotion, including a more markehriented name that emphasized the red color and that it was farm‐raised in saltwater, to distinguish it from darkcolored, wild‐caught freshwater tilapia. Local saltwater production of Florida red tilapia could help supply the market demand for fresh, marine fish in Puerto Rico if producers can meet the demand for quality, availability and price.

Coral's hidden riches.,"Salm, R.","The mysterious sea surface conceals the coral reef ecosystem, making it difficult for planners and decision makers to understand the consequences of their decisions on channel dredging, marina construction, industries along the water's edge, and upstream logging. Reef systems support a rich diversity of life and fish. They provide a natural breakwater and have touristic value. Many species dependent on reef ecosystems produce very active biochemical compounds which have pharmaceutical value (e.g. anticancer drugs and antibiotics). Further, people have used the boulder coral to develop a model for bone implants. Coral reefs protect coastal villages and hotels from rising sea levels. People directly exploit, overharvest, and destroy coral reefs and thus are the major threat to reef biodiversity. The 2 reasons for these human actions against reefs are subsistence and development activities. Local communities need to be included in the conservation planning process of coral reefs and benefit from reef conservation. Poor or divided institutional responsibilities and capacity are the main obstacles to achieving reef conservation in the western Indian Ocean, Coral reef conservation should include a system of parks and reserves supported by a wide focused coastal zone management. Research is needed to provide information on reef species and distribution, uses, and threats, and the processes that sustain reefs.

"Acoustic mapping as an environmental management tool: I. Detection of barrels of low-level radioactive waste, Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, California","Karl, H.A.; Schwab, W.C.; Wright, A.St.C.; Drake, D.E.; Chin, J.L.; Danforth, W.W.; Ueber, E.","The oceans have been and will continue to be disposal sites for a wide variety of waste products. Often these wastes are not dumped at the designated sites or transport occurs during or after dumping, and, subsequent attempts to monitor the effects the waste products have on the environment are inadequate because the actual location of the waste is not known. Acoustic mapping of the seafloor with sidescan sonar is a very effective technique for locating and monitoring dredge-spoil material and other debris. Sidescan sonar provides an acoustic image or sonograph of the sea floor that is similar to a satellite image of the Earth's land surface. In effect sidescan sonar allows the water column to be stripped from the sea floor, thereby providing a clear, unobstructed view of the sea bed. An example of the potential of this technique is summarized herein for the Gulf of the Farallones region. More than 47 800 drums (55 gallon) and other containers of low-level radioactive waste were dumped on the continental margin offshore the San Francisco Bay between 1946 and 1970. These drums now litter a large area (1200 km2) of the sea floor within the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS). The exact location of the drums and the potential hazard the drums pose to the environment are unknown. To evaluate the risk, samples of the sediment, biota and water must be collected near and distant from the concentrations of barrels. To do this the exact location of the barrels must be known prior to sampling. The USGS, through a cooperative research agreement with GFNMS, used sidescan sonar to map two areas within the sanctuary. Total sea-floor coverage was obtained and computer-processed sonographic mosaics were constructed on board ship. Many small nongeologic targets were distributed throughout the survey areas that covered about 70 km2 on the shelf and 120 km2 on the slope. Analysis of the sidescan data suggests that the targets are 55-gallon drums. This interpretation was confirmed at one site with an underwater video and 35-mm camera system. Data were collected with both a 30-kHz and a 120-kHz sidescan system within a 15-km2 area on the shelf. We found that the barrels were more easily detected with the mid-range 30-kHz system than with the higher resolution 120-kHz system. Maps of barrel distribution derived from the sonographs are being used to design sampling schemes to evaluate the risk that the radioactivity may have on the biota and environment. © 1994.",1994,,Ocean and Coastal Management,22,3,201-227,,10.1016/0964-5691(94)90032-9,,#21535,Karl 1994,,

The project is a cooperative effort between Washington's Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Environmental Protection Agencies's Environmental Monitoring Lab in Las Vegas (EPA EMSL-LV) and the Puget Sound Water Quality Authority (PSWQA). The project is now part of the Puget Sound Ambient Monitoring Program, now formalized as a CCMP. Existing inventories-the Coastal Zone Atlas (Ecology, 1980), the Puget Sound Environmental Atlas (PSWQA, 1987), and the National Wetland Inventory-all suffer from either outdated information, inadequate resolution, or inaccurate information, especially in subtidal regions. Remote sensing data acquisition and georeferencing is described in Balogh et al. (this conference). The data is classified by Dethier's system which is compatible with the Cowardin classification system used in the NWI. The classified data is transferred to a vector-based geographic information system and used to update the marine and estuarine portions of the NWI data. Data structure is described. Uses of the data include proprietary management by the Department of Natural Resources to sustain long-term ecosystem and economic viability, wetland protection, oil spill response, natural resource damage, and mandated growth management planning by local governments.

Preliminary caesium data from a cooperative us/ussr monitoring survey for chernobyl radioactivity in the black sea,"Curtis, W.R.; Broadway, J.A.","In June 1990, scientists from the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Radiation Programs (ORP), and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), travelled to Sevastopol in the Soviet Union to work with radioecologists and marine scientists from the USSR Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas (IBSS). The purpose of this cooperative programme was to conduct a monitoring survey for radioactivity in the northwestern Black Sea. Samples of sediment, surface and in-situ water, and biota were collected from fourteen stations for post-survey radionuclide analyses to determine levels of radioactivity in the Black Sea environment resulting from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion and subsequent transport of radioactivity via the Dnepr and Danube rivers.

Mitochondria (1.19 g·cm‐3) and chloroplasts (1.15 g·cm‐3) were recovered in sucrose gradients at densities similar to those observed for higher plants and most algae. The position of endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane in the gradients was monitored by NADPH cytochrome c reductase and vanadate‐sensitive Mg2+‐ATPase, respectively. Higher plant Golgi markers, latent undine diphosphatase (UDPase) and glucan synthase I, were colocalized at a density range including two peaks of activity at 1.13–1.15 g·cm‐3. Bound calcium was associated with high density (1.15 g·cm‐3) membranes. Ca2+‐stimulated ATPase was found at high levels on membranes that did not coisolate with the latent UDPase‐containing membranes. The Ca2+‐stimulated ATPase, a possible participant during calcification, was associated with a chloroplast‐enriched fraction in all the organelle separation systems. However, about 30% of the total activity was separated from both the chloroplasts and Golgi on 0–70% Percoll gradients containing 0.4 M sucrose. The possible relationship of the Golgi and the high‐density organelle exhibiting Ca2+‐stimulated ATPase to coccolithogenesis and the process of calcification and crystal formation is discussed.

Protection of the Mediterranean Marine Environment,"SALIBA, L.J.","The specific problems of the Mediterranean, leading to progressive deterioration of the marine environment as a result of an interplay of climatic, oceanographic and socio‐economic factors requiring cooperative in addition to individual intervention, are briefly described, and areas of concern are identified. Events leading to the adoption of the Mediterranean Action Plan in 1975 by governments of the region, to control the situation, are outlined. The main components of the Action Plan (legal, environmental assessment and environmental management) and institutional and financial framework, together with its gradual evolution from a mainly marine pollution orientated programme into a comprehensive environmental one for the whole of the Mediterranean basin, are described. The Plan's achievements in (i) the progressive reduction of marine pollution at source, (ii) the establishment and enhancement of national pollution monitoring programmes, (iii) the formulation and adoption of common environmental quality criteria and standards, (iv) the creation of alternative scenarios for Mediterranean development, and (v) orientation towards integrated coastal zone planning and management programmes, are discussed, together with technical and political problems in implementation. The role of the Mediterranean Action Plan as a potential model for other regions is appraised. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

THE RED SEA ‐ GULF OF ADEN: RE‐ASSESSMENT OF HYDROCARBON POTENTIAL Abstract†,"Beydoun, Z.R.; Sikander, A.H.","THE results and conclusions of the UNDP/World Bank Red Sea ‐ Gulf of Aden Regional Hydrocarbons Study Project (June. 1989‐January, 1992) are summarised. These results were derived from detailed examination of pooled public‐sector date provided to the project by the participating bordering states in the region; these included samples and logs from ca. 56 wells drilled in the two basins (out of a total of 71 wells). and some 30,000 line‐kms of reflection seismic (out of 110.000 km available). well‐logs were digitised and correlated, and basin‐wide biostratigraphic, lithostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental studies, source‐rock organic richness. quality and maturity studies and sedimentological analyses were performed by contracted specialist staff in UK and France, and integrated with basin‐wide seismic structural and isopach mapping for selected regional reflectors/intervals by national task forces in Cairo under project supervision: academically‐derived crustal seismic and other geophysical data, and supervision; academically‐derived crustal seismic and other geophysical data, and industrially‐derived velocity and other borehole data were also integrated for the Red‐Sea. Modelling, utilising recently‐acquired geophysical data, indicates crustal asymmetry for the Red sea rift, with oceanic crust of pull‐apart basin type flooring some portions of offshore Egypt and Sudan on the west, and stretched continental crust underlying the eastern Arabian flank. These results suggest that sinistral strike‐slip processes controlled the intial break‐up of the Arabian Plate shaping the African flank as a sharp plate boundary,. Similar processes appear to have initially shaped the Somalia flank of the Gulf of Aden Rift. Only later did true sea‐floor spreading propagate: 10–12 million years age in the eastern Gulf of Aden; and <ca.5 million years age in the western Gulf of Aden, Afar and the southern/central Red Sea. Biostratigraphic work shows deep subsidence and ocean‐water inundation commenced in the late middle Oligocene in the Gulf of Aden, in the late Oligocene in the southern Red Sea, and in the early Miocene in the central Red Sea/Gulf of suez.

Solidification/Stabilization is being emphasized in the current program. This technology may enhance the environmental performance of the residues when disposed in the land, when used as road bed aggregate, as building blocks, and in the marine environment as reefs or shore erosion control barriers. The program includes four S/S process types: cement, silicate, cement kiln dust and a phosphate based process. Residue types being evaluated are fly ash, bottom ash and combined residues. An array of chemical leaching tests and physical tests are being conducted to characterize the untreated and treated residues. This paper discusses program design and general observations based on available results. The S/S evaluation program is the first phase of ORD's Municipal Solid Waste Innovative Technology Evaluation (MITE) program; a program to demonstrate and evaluate technologies for managing municipal solid waste.

A Phased‐in approach to greenhouse‐gas‐induced climatic change,"Schlesinger, M.E.; Jiang, X.","To address this concern, it will be helpful to describe the motivation, objective, approach, and scope of our Nature study. One of us, Schlesinger, was an invited participant at the White House Conference on Science and Economics Research Related to Global Change, held in Washington, D.C., April 17–18, 1990. At this conference two opposing policy positions were espoused, neither of which appeared to have been based on a scientific evaluation of the global warming issue. This motivated our study to assess the urgency of this issue. Our approach was to use our simplified climate/ocean model, which we employed in projections for the IPCC report on global warming to the year 2100 [Houghton et al., 1990], to determine how much of the potential reduction in future global warming would be lost if the initiation of a 20‐year transition from the emission rate of the IPCC “business‐as‐usual” scenario A to the emission rate of any other IPCC scenario (B, C, D) was deferred by 10 years. Our findings were that 5% of the potential reduction, at most, would be lost by such a 10‐year deferral, regardless of the temperature sensitivity of the climate system to a CO2 doubling (ΔT2x) , within the 0.5–4.5° range we considered. This result indicates to us that the urgency of the global warming issue is not as great as some have thought, and suggests that we have some time to improve our understanding of the issue to enhance our ability to respond appropriately ©1991.

The California Current system and its regional and subregional components are coming under authorities and mandates which require fine scale ocean research and monitoring. Projects are emerging that range from environmental monitoring and clean-ups to management of Marine Sanctuaries, estuaries and bays. This provides unusual opportunities for those managing these venues to organize and coordinate needed studies. Applied oceanography and resource management efforts are best planned and carried out within cooperative contexts, rather than competitive ones, given the state of US and California funding for ocean science. Organizations of regional and multiple Agency consortia have begun, and the implementation of the NOAA Center for Ocean Analysis and Prediction at FNOC, and the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Integrated Ocean Sciences (CIRIOS) between NOAA and the Naval Postgraduate School, provide mechanisms for third parties to access the ocean and atmosphere information needed to act efficiently in research and resource management contexts, and provides a convenient information/data base management system for both access and archiving research products for use in other contexts.

Coastal resources management planning and implementation for the Fishery Sector Program of the Philippines,"White, Alan T.; Lopez, Nelson","This paper explains the methods being used to plan for and implement a coastal resources management (CRM) component of the Fishery Sector Program (FSP) for the Philippines. The FSP, supported by the Asian Development Bank and implemented by the Department of Agriculture, intends to generate CRM plans through site-specific planning processes and to implement these plans through local government and nongovernment participation. The FSP has six components which are complementary and partly overlapping, these are: fishery resource and ecological assessments; CRM in twelve priority bays; law enforcement; research and extension; credit to promote alternative livelihood options; and fisheries-related infrastructure improvement. The CRM component, which has implications for most of the other components, is being initially implemented in three bays as pilot sites for the FSP. CRM planning entails resource, ecological, socioeconomic, cultural, legal and institutional assessments for management. Formulation of CRM plans is through local government, communities and nongovernment organizations as facilitated by Departments of Agriculture, and Environment and Natural Resources field offices with guidance from the Project Management Office and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in Manila. Strategies for the implementation of the CRM plans typically involve the use of community-based resource management schemes. These include municipal marine parks; municipal and bay wide boundaries, zones and use rights for particular areas and resources; artificial reefs; special law enforcement officers at the village level; localized education programs; alternative livelihood projects and bay-wide management councils.",1991,,,1,,762-775,,,,#21550,White 1991,,
"Shootout-89, An Evaluation of Knowledge-based Weather Forecasting Systems","Moninger, W.R.","During the summer of 1989, the Forecast Systems Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sponsored an evaluation of artificial-intelligence-based systems that forecast severe convective storms. The evaluation experiment, called Shootout-89, took place in Boulder, and focussed on storms over the northeastern Colorado foothills and plains. (Moninger, et al., 1990) Six systems participated in Shootout-89. These included traditional expert systems, an analogy-based system, and a system developed using methods from the cognitive science/judgment analysis tradition. Each day of the exercise, the systems generated 2 to 9 hour forecasts of the probabilities of occurrence of: nonsignificant weather, significant weather, and severe weather, in each of four regions in northeastern Colorado. A verification coordinator working at the Denver Weather Service Forecast Office gathered ground-truth data from a network of observers. Systems were evaluated on the basis of several measures of forecast skill, and on other metrics such as timeliness, ease of learning, and ease of use. Systems were generally easy to operate, however the various systems required substantially different levels of meteorological expertise on the part of their users–reflecting the various operational environments for which the systems had been designed. Systems varied in their statistical behavior, but on this difficult forecast problem, the systems generally showed a skill approximately equal to that of persistence forecasts and climatological (historical frequency) forecasts. The two systems that appeared best able to discriminate significant from nonsignificant weather events were traditional expert systems. Both of these systems required the operator to make relatively sophisticated meteorological judgments. We are unable, based on only one summer's worth of data, to determine the extent to which the greater skill of the two systems was due to the content of their knowledge bases, or to the subjective judgments of the operator.

The Northern Environment: Is Cooperation Coming?,"Stokke, O.S.","Current Arctic regimes are narrow and shallow, but the potential for increased cooperation seems high. In the areas of science, petroleum development, fisheries management, and marine protection, the predominance of strategic considerations is increasingly being challenged in key Arctic states. Groups such as scientists, industrial firms, and environmental organizations portray these problems in terms of cost efficiency rather than competition, and the assessment of national interests is less straightforward than before. In this situation, processes of regime formation will be less structured, and senior policymakers in the Arctic will be more influenced by situational factors. Today these are very favorable for cooperation, due to the sense of urgency present in certain areas, the entrepreneurial activity of some actors, and the presence in each issue area of cooperative salient solutions. © 1990, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

Assessment of the population by aerial surveys combined with monitoring of the aboriginal hunters' harvest suggest that the take is well below the sustainable yield. However, the reproductive rate of dugongs is so low that it will be a decade before the status of the population can be established. Therefore, a conservative management policy for dugongs is recommended while acknowledging the rights of traditional hunters.

A Standard Reference Diet for Crustacean Nutrition Research. I. Evaluation of Two Formulations,"Castell, J.D.; Kean, J.C.; D'Abramo, L.R.; Conklin, D.E.","An international cooperative effort to evaluate two possible Standard Reference Diets (SRD) for crustaceans was initiated at an informal discussion on crustacean nutrition during the 1984 World Mariculture Society (WMS) meeting in Vancouver, B.C. One diet, BML 81 S, was developed at the Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis. The other, HFXCRD 84, was developed at the Halifax laboratory, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada. Details of the formulation, preparation and proximate composition of the diets are provided. Both of these diets, which had been used to culture lobster, Homarus sp., were compared with the usual control diets of several research teams from different countries in feeding trials with many different species of crustaceans including freshwater and marine shrimp, prawn, lobster, crayfish and crab. The preliminary data on growth and survival ofPandalus danae, Penaeus monodon, P. stylirostris, P. vannamei, P. brasiliensis, P. setiferus, P. aztecus and Homarus americanus suggest that either BML 81 S or HFX CRD 84 would be an acceptable SRD for these species. The only species tested that would not accept either diet were Panulirus argus and Cherux tenuimanus. Use of an SRD will provide a more accurate assessment of non‐nutritional growth factors and permit comparisons among laboratories, species and experiments. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

Mixed layer dynamics: Progress and new directions,"Müller, P.; Garwood, R.W., Jr.","The dynamics of the oceanic surface mixed layer was the topic of the Fourth ‘Aha Huliko'a Hawaiian Winter Workshop. The meeting was hosted by the University of Hawaii and was held from January 14 to 16, 1987. Some two dozen participants, representing diverse experimental and theoretical interests and viewpoints, were charged with “evaluating the state of the art and offering suggestions for future research.” The ocean is primarily driven at the sea surface by the atmosphere. The fluxes of momentum, mass, and heat into the ocean are controlled by the oceanic surface mixed layer. Proper understanding of mixed layer dynamics is hence paramount for almost every problem in physical oceanography. This central role is not limited to physical oceanography. Mixed layer dynamics also affect the natural and anthropogenic chemical fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere and therefore the geochemical cycle of many substances (F.

ASSESSING INTERGOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION IN COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT,"Lowry, K.; Eichenberg, T.","One of the primary incentives to state governments to participate in the national coastal zone management program is the legal requirement that federal resources use activities as well as federal projects and federally permitted activities that affect state ocean and coastal areas must be consistent with federally‐approved state coastal programs. The “consistency provisions” are among the most innovative attempts to insure intergovernmental coordination in resource management. In assessing the implementation of the consistency provisions, we find that this legal requirement has led to the development of a variety of formal and informal collaborative mechanisms for intergovernmental coordination in ocean and coastal management. While these mechanisms have led to the resolution of the vast majority of federal‐state conflicts in coastal areas some important federal‐state conflicts have not been resolved. This has more to do with the character of these particular conflicts than the general effectiveness of the mechanisms for collaboration that have been established. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell.

"Marine reserves: How effective as management strategies for Philippine, Indonesian and Malaysian coral reef environments?","White, A.T.","This study evaluates the effectiveness of marine reserves as an approach to coral reef management in Southeast Asia and isolates the most effective management techniques. Seven reserve areas in the Philippines are compared with two similar management areas in Indonesia and two in Malaysia. Two control areas in the Philippines are also considered. Comparison of the areas includes the following: (1) documentation of the status of various reefs in the three countries, in terms of biology, management approaches, patterns of human use, and the larger environmental setting; (2) examination of the effect of various factors, including formal management schemes, human exploitation, and general setting, on the reef; and (3) a summary of those generalities found among sites in terms of environmental conditions, management and use by humans. Coral reef parameters are used to evaluate reef condition. These parameters include: substrate cover; density of coral genera, Acanihaster and Tridacna; chaetodontid diversity; topographic relief; and noticeable damage. Sites are ranked in terms of reef quality and are compared as to remoteness, human exploitation, destructive uses and management types. Municipal and national management approaches are contrasted and the effect of local education, scientific and tourist interests are noted at each site. Those sites with active local participation in management show the greates potential for environmental maintenance and improvement. At other sites where some form of management exists, except one, the management shows a positive impact and a potential for sustainability.

The application of geodetic radio interferometric surveying to the monitoring of sea‐level,"Carter, W.E.; Robertson, D.S.; Pyle, T.E.; Diamante, J.","Summary. Under project IRIS (International Radio Interferometric Surveying) geodesists are using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to monitor polar motion to 1‐2 ms of arc and UT1 to 0.05‐0.10 ms, and to develop a global geodynamic network to detect and study centimetre level displacements of reference points associated with large‐scale phenomena such as tectonic plate motion and glacial rebound. Differential positioning techniques using the signals broadcast by the satellites of the Global Positioning System (GPS) are being used to study finer scale phenomena, such as localized subsidence, and economically to relate these specialized surveys to the geodynamic network. Including tide gauge stations in this system will make it possible to detect motions of specific gauges and correct or delete the measurements from those gauges when computing changes in sea‐level. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has selected several tide gauges on the east and west coasts of the United States, and initial epoch GPS surveys to tie the gauges to VLBI observations have already begun. Other countries participating in project IRIS are planning similar activities. In addition to providing a globally based land reference datum for the tide gauge measurements, the IRIS polar motion and UT1 time series may contribute directly to monitoring and interpreting global sea level changes. Changes in the volume and distribution of ice masses result in long‐term motions of the axis of rotation, and sea‐level changes affect the length of day (lod). The IRIS time series will certainly have the resolution required to detect the expected polar motion and changes in lod, and a properly designed global VLBI/GPS network should allow the ice/sea‐level effects to be separated from crustal dynamics effects.

Deep-water archaeological investigation and site testing in the Monitor national marine sanctuary,"Watts, G.P., Jr.","The location in August 1973 and subsequent identification of the USS Monitor in January 1974 focused renewed public attention on the celebrated American warship and stimulated considerable interest in recovery of the vessel, in the interest of preserving the remains of the Monitor for scientific investigation and responsible development, the historic ship was designated the United States’ first National Marine Sanctuary on January 30, 1975. Since that designation the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources have cooperated to develop policies for protection and management of the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary. By 1977 the scope of these activities had been expanded to include the development of a planning document to identify research priorities and the continuation of on-site investigation. In 1979 the NOAA, the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, and Harbor Branch Foundation cosponsored an investigation in the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary designed to collect data related to previously identified research objectives, in addition to generating new information about the Monitor, the project provided archaeologists with the opportunity to utilize one example of the sophisticated mixed-gas, lockout submersible delivery and support systems available to support research at depths below the safe working limits of conventional scuba diving equipment. © 1985 Maney Publishing.",1985,,Journal of Field Archaeology,12,3,315-331,,10.1179/jfa.1985.12.3.315,,#21564,Watts 1985,,
Health and nutrition of labourers' families in Papua New Guinea.,"Huntsman, A.C.","The nutritional status of the wives and children of laborers employed by an oil palm plantation in the West New Britain Province of Papua New Guinea was anthropetrically assessed. The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of the introduction of cash cropping on the nutritional status of rural families. The oil palm plantation was a part of a larger oil palm project. The project included 1) the government managed Smallholder Development Scheme, in which small landholdings are leased to and individually farmed by settler farmers and 2) the Nucleus Estate Scheme, in which a large oil palm plantation is operated by private companies under an agreement with the government. The anthropometric study was conducted on a sample of the wives and children of the 474 married laborers employed under the Nucleus Estate Scheme. The sample consisted of 100 wives and 141 children under 5 years of age. In addition, data on household expenditures and dietary patterns were collected in a survey of the households of 30 laborers and compared with a similar survey of households participating in the Smallholders Development Scheme. Anthropometric measurements indicated that the weight for age (W/A) of 17% of the children was less than 80% of W/A Standard. This finding indicated that malnutrition was less prevalent on the estate than in the country as a whole. In 1978, the W/A of 37% of the nation's children was less than 80% of the W/A Standard. In the estate sample, the highest proportion of low W/A children occurred in the 24-47 month age group. Most of the poorly nourished estate children were stunted (an indication of chronic malnutrition) rather than wasted (an indication of short term malnutrition). Among the wives of the laborers, 48% were anemic, about 75% had low reserves of subcutaneous fat, 30% had mid upper arm circumferences (MUCA) less than 85% of the MUAC Standard, and none were below 80% of the weight for height (W/H) Standard. The estate women appeared to have shorter birth intervals than other Papua New Guinea populations. The household survey data indicated that the average annual income of settlers and laborers was similar; however, the laborers had to purchase almost all their food while the settlers grew most of their food. The diet of the laborers was more varied and included more protein than the diet of the settlers, but the consumption pattern of the laborer families was erratic. At the beginning of the fortnight pay period it was much better than toward the end of the pay period when families ran out of money. Some of the estate families handled their money poorly. In most rural communities, women manage the family food allocations. With the introduction of cash cropping, men generally assume control of the family income, including the allocation of money for food. Some of the men used an insufficient portion of their income for food purchases. In summary, the nutritional status of the children of the laborers was better than the nutritional status of children in the general population. The major factors which contributed toward malnourishment in some of the estate families were 1) the misallocation of income, 2) poor dietary habits, and 3) the high occurrence of malaria in the West New Britain Province.",1984,,Papua and New Guinea Medical Journal,27,2,73-81,,,,#21565,Huntsman 1984,,
First JECSS Workshop,"Ichiye, T.","The first Japan and East China Seas Study (JECSS) workshop convened at Tsukuba University, about 60 km north of Tokyo, Japan, June 1–4, 1981, to assess hydrographic data, review descriptive and theoretical Work, and promote future cooperation for studying the Japan Sea and East China Sea and marginal seas of the Western North Pacific Ocean. The conveners were Takashi Ichiye of Texas A&M University and Kenzo Takano of Tsukuba University, and the workshop was funded by the Hidaka Foundation, which was founded by Koji Hidaka, patriarch of dynamic oceanography in Japan. There were 41 participants: seven from the United States, six from Korea, one from the Peoples Republic of China, and 27 from Japan. Twenty‐four papers were presented, and topics included the Japan Sea, the East China Sea, and marginal seas in general. Subjects concerned descriptive physical oceanography; internal waves, tides, and shelf waves; circulation modeling; data assessment; remote sensing; and sedimentology and marine chemistry. The seasonal change of the Tsushima Current, a branch of the Kuroshio in the Japan Sea, was determined by the Tohoku University group; preliminary results of the NOAA R/V Oceanographer cruise in Spring 1980 were presented; and the numerical modeling of the Japan Sea circulation, the tides of the Yellow Sea, and the barotropic current of the East China Sea were discussed. The papers presented will be published in 1982 in La Mer, a journal of the Japanese‐French Oceanographical Society. ©1982. American Geophysical Union.

Structures of Détente and Ecological Interdependence: Cooperation in the Baltic Sea Area for the Protection of Marine Environment and Living Resources,"Rytövuori, H.","In comparison with the more general structural features in the Baltic region, a special kind of functional system with the participation of all the Baltic states has been created for the protection of the marine environment and living resources in the Baltic Sea area. The questions posed by the author are: What is the function of this particular 'system' in the context of the more general systemic structures of the region? Is it relatively isolated from, or linked to, other more politicized issue-areas? What are the possibilities for, and limits to, further cooperation? Two approaches could be taken to evaluate these matters. First, such cooperation could be considered in instrumental terms, i.e. we could focus on its contribution to the creation, strengthening and diversification of the structures of détente at a sub-regional level; the forms of cooperation discussed could be regarded as prime examples of such manifold multilateral cooperation between states representing different socio-economic systems, the promotion of which is encouraged in the Final Act of the CSCE at an all-European level. However, a different approach, turning the functionalist formulation upside down and asking to what extent the politicization of technical coopera tion limits advancement of collaboration in these fields is considered more relevant in this context. It is concluded that the process of détente cannot be said to have generated the cooperation, and that the cooperation that has evolved is likely to function despite certain political impediments and deadlocks. © 1980, Sage Publications.

Modelling ocean‐loading effects on tidal gravity in Australia,"Bretreger, K.; Mather, R.S.","Summary. Tidal gravity measurements were recorded in Australia and Papua New Guinea between 1974 and 1976 as a cooperative programme between the International Centre for Earth Tides, Bruxelles, the Department of Geodesy at the University of New South Wales and the Government of Australia's Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics, Canberra. This series of observations was analysed for the effect of ocean loading on tidal gravity with a view to modelling these effects as a function of space and time in the Australian region. In the absence of reliable tidal models for S2, K1 and P1 tidal constituents, it was decided to restrict the analysis to the M2 wave as the observations were only taken over four‐month periods at many of the sites. The ocean‐tide models used for the M2 wave in the present study were two models prepared by Hendershott and one by Zahel. The ocean‐tide loading effects were computed using each of the three tidal models at every one of the nine sites occupied in Australia and Papua New Guinea using a simplified model of the crustal response as an alternative to representation by the set of load deformation coefficients h′n, k′n. The objective was the development of a model for the Earth response which can generate the ocean loading effect on tidal gravity at any point on the Australian mainland so that it is adequate for correcting quasi‐radial distance measurements to extraterrestrial sources in Earth orbit for the effect of Earth tides to ±2 cm, in conjunction with adequate supplementary tiltmeter data. It is shown that a ten‐parameter representation of the crustal response is adequate for modelling the deformation of the Earth tide by ocean loading at any site in Australia with a resolution of ±2 μgal provided extrapolation is not performed over distances greater than 103 km. This is assessed as being of sufficient accuracy for all purposes in high‐precision geodesy. It was not possible to establish the stability of the model over long periods of time in excess of a few years in the absence of a continuous recording of tidal gravity over sufficiently long periods of time. The separation of the actual radial deformation due to ocean loading from the effect on tidal gravity could not be achieved in the absence of reliable tiltmeter data in the region which were only available at Cooney Observatory, Armidale.

Wobble and nutation of the Earth,"Smith, M.L.","Elastic‐gravitational normal mode theory is used to study theoretically the free wobble and free nutation of a suite of geophysically plausible rotating slightly elliptical earth models. We principally find that observations of wobble eigenfrequencies are not likely to constrain strongly the structure of the Earth's fluid core, that the results of our calculations, together with Dahlen's estimate of the ocean correction, yield the observed Chandler wobble period within its observational uncertainty and that estimates of wobble excitation by earthquakes based on quasi‐static calculations of the Earth's response are correctly computed. Also we summarize several analytical treatments of both wobble and internal core modes of rotating Earth models and use that information to assess analytically and numerically the approximate theory exploited here. We show that the approximation we use is valid for the Earth's major free wobbles but not for studying internal modes in the fluid core. By exploiting the existence of analytic solutions to certain members of the general class of problems of interest to us here, we have been able to explore the range over which the numerical theory used here is valid. In particular, the theory is adequate to describe the major mantle wobbles of the Earth – namely the Chandler wobble and the nearly diurnal free wobble. It is also adequate to describe the response of the Earth to tidal potentials, at least to the extent that ‘internal’ modes in the fluid core do not participate in the Earth's response. The theory has been demonstrated to be sorely inadequate for two other classes of normal modes: internal core modes and the Chandler Wobble of the solid inner‐core. In both cases the failure of the theory is associated with the inability of our finite representation to adequately represent motion in the fluid. These failures are not evident from inspection of the numerical results alone; their detection was only made possible by the availability of analytic solutions. A corollary of these results is that recent published calculations of internal core modes for rotating geophysically plausible earth models by Crossley (1975) and Shen & Mansinha (1976) are almost surely invalid. The theoretical basis for those studies, like the one exploited here, is wholly inadequate to describe internal core modes. Copyright © 1977, Wiley Blackwell.

Fishery survey of Cedar Lakes and the Brazos and SamJBernard River estuaries.,"Johnson, R.B.","This report describes a study done on the marine fishery resources of the sparsely populated coastal region southwest of Freeport, Texas, which was conducted from Feb. 1973 through Jan. 1975. The purpose was to study the biology and hydrography of the estuaries, determine use of the environment by juveniles of economically important marine organisms, provide an inventory of the biota, and use the information to develop recommendations and procedures to maintain important habitat. Included in the report is a description of the area and a station description of the lake areas. Some of the recommendations made by the author from the research gathered include: each proposed dredging and construction project should be carefully investigated prior to commencement, and monitored during operation; construction below mean high tide should be avoided in most of the lakes; methods of oil and gas exploration, such as slant-well drilling, should be used where conventional methods would disturb bay bottoms; the Dow Chemical Company, Texas Water Quality Bard, and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Dept. should cooperate in determining which components of the Dow effluent are repellent (or toxic) to organisms in the Brazon River.

Shallow-water sound attenuation in a standard area,"Wille, P.; Thiele, R.; Schunk, E.","Shallow-water attenuation loss was studied under varying oceanographic conditions within a standard area. By using combined ship-aircraft measurement methods, sound-propagation characteristics were ascertained in conjunction with relevant environmental parameters. The selected sea area had only very slight lateral variation for all environmental characteristics permitting good control of measurements. Evaluations to date indicate typical frequency-response differences for attenuation, with or without sea-surface participation in sound propagation. With bottom participation only, the magnitude and frequency response of the attenuation have a first approximation consisting of a model with the bottom represented only as a quasiliquid smooth stratification of the complex sound velocity and density. © 1986, American Association of Physics Teachers.

Wind Energy on the High Seas: Regulatory Challenges for a Science Fiction Future,"Herrera Anchustegui, I.; Radovich, V.S.","This paper aims to study the current regulation and governance of wind energy turbines on the high seas and detect regulatory challenges. We focus on the existing regulatory framework to develop marine wind farms in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), the nature of wind farms and wind turbines in said areas, and which governance schemes and institutions ought to coordinate and regulate any future marine wind energy development. Our research shows that under public international law, the deployment of wind turbines on (most parts of) the high seas for all States is possible, but many issues still remain, either thinly regulated or unanswered. We inquire where, by whom, and how can marine wind parks be built on the high seas according to public international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (the LOSC). Lastly, we evaluate the possible role of marine spatial planning (MSP) in developing wind energy on the high seas. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,,Energies,15,23,,,10.3390/en15239157,,#21577,HerreraAnchustegui 2022,,
"Geoheritage of the Kandalaksha region (Kola Peninsula, White Sea, Arctic Russia), Evaluation, and Geotourism Opportunities","Miłosz, H.; Galina, Z.; Mariya, M.; Ramziya, G.; Olga, I.","The subarctic Kandalaksha region abounds in many tourist values and is notably characterized by a richness of geology, nature, history, and landscape. Its mountains are located directly on the coast of the White Sea. The skerry-fiord coast is the habitat of many seabirds that nest on its many islands. There is also large mammals such as seals and bears. The coastal area and islands are a reserve within the National Park that was established to protect the breeding areas of the seabirds. Despite its location near the Arctic Circle, the area has a relatively mild climate. Many of the villages and towns in the area have a centuries-old history inextricably linked to the indigenous peoples (Karelians, Sami) who inhabited the area, as well as to the “Pomors,” the first Russian colonizers of the area. On top of this, this is a location with an environment that contains numerous examples of flora and fauna, as well as a geologically and geomorphologically interesting landscape connected with glaciation, abrasion, and isostatic movements. Here, the geological substrate, made up of Paleoproterozoic collisional structures of the Lapland Granulite Belt, was repeatedly tectonically rejuvenated within the forming aulacogen of the White Sea and the Kola-Lapland Mobile Belt, along with numerous Paleozoic intrusions of kimberlite and alkaline rocks. The youngest processes are associated with Pleistocene glaciation and isostatic relaxation in the Holocene. All these features contribute to the high tourist potential of the area. At present, it is being developed in a more or less organized way with the participation of private capital. This article presents a proposal for the systematic development of the area in question and the formalization of tourist routes in the area. This article aims to meet this need by proposing a tourist trail in the Kandalaksha area so as to enable tourists to explore this remarkable area. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,Geoheritage,14,4,,,10.1007/s12371-022-00726-4,,#21579,Miłosz 2022,,
"Direction, not detail: Progress towards consensus at the fourth intergovernmental conference on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction","Mendenhall, E.; De Santo, E.; Jankila, M.; Nyman, E.; Tiller, R.","After a two year delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the fourth intergovernmental conference (IGC-4) in the negotiations for a new UN treaty to address the conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) took place in March 2022. This meeting differed substantially from previous IGCs in terms of process, with much of the discussions occurring in ‘informal informals,’ or off-the-record meetings open only to delegates and registered observers. Additionally, in-person participation was extremely limited and observers only had access to web broadcasts, i.e., no in-person interactions with delegates. A draft text of the treaty was circulated in advance and provided the basis for discussion and negotiation at the meeting. This paper examines IGC-4 in line with previous analyses of the first three IGCs, tracing the process and outcomes to date, aiming to understand the factors and players that are building a new BBNJ agreement. Key themes explored include marine genetic resources (MGRs), area-based management tools, including marine protected areas (ABMTs/MPAs), environmental impact assessment (EIA), and capacity building and transfer of marine technology (CB/TMT). Some progress toward consensus has been made, buoyed by intersessional discussions, but several sticking points remain with regard to definitions, content, and processes enshrined in the draft treaty, and a fifth IGC is scheduled to take place from 15 to 26 August 2022. © 2022 The Authors",2022,,Marine Policy,146,,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2022.105309,,#21582,Mendenhall 2022,,
Habitat Protection Indexes - new monitoring measures for the conservation of coastal and marine habitats,"Kumagai, J.A.; Favoretto, F.; Pruckner, S.; Rogers, A.D.; Weatherdon, L.V.; Aburto-Oropeza, O.; Niamir, A.","A worldwide call to implement habitat protection aims to halt biodiversity loss. We constructed an open-source, standardized, and reproducible workflow that calculates two indexes to monitor the extent of coastal and marine habitats within protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures. The Local Proportion of Habitats Protected Index (LPHPI) pinpoints the jurisdictions with the greatest opportunity to expand their protected or conserved areas, while the Global Proportion of Habitats Protected Index (GPHPI) showcases which jurisdictions contribute the most area to the protection of these habitats globally. We also evaluated which jurisdictions have the highest opportunity to contribute globally to protecting habitats by meeting a target of 30% coverage. We found that Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ) have the greatest potential to do so. Our workflow can also be easily extended to terrestrial and freshwater habitats. These indexes are helpful to monitor aspects of the Sustainable Development Goal 14 and the emerging post-2020 global biodiversity framework, to understand the current status of international cooperation on coastal and marine habitats conservation. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,Scientific Data,9,1,,,10.1038/s41597-022-01296-4,,#21583,Kumagai 2022,,
Population estimates of photo-identified individuals using a modified POPAN model reveal that Raja Ampat’s reef manta rays are thriving,"Setyawan, E.; Stevenson, B.C.; Erdmann, M.V.; Hasan, A.W.; Sianipar, A.B.; Mofu, I.; Putra, M.I.H.; Izuan, M.; Ambafen, O.; Fewster, R.M.; Aldridge-Sutton, R.; Mambrasar, R.; Constantine, R.","The 6.7-million-hectare Raja Ampat archipelago is home to Indonesia’s largest reef manta ray (Mobula alfredi) population and a representative network of nine marine protected areas (MPAs). However, the population dynamics of M. alfredi in the region are still largely unknown. Using our photo-identification database, we fitted modified POPAN mark-recapture models with transience and per capita recruitment parameters to estimate key demographic characteristics of M. alfredi from two of Raja Ampat’s largest MPAs: Dampier Strait and South East (SE) Misool. A total of 1,041 unique individuals were photo-identified over an 11-year period (2009–2019) from Dampier Strait (n = 515) and SE Misool (n = 536). In our models, apparent survival probabilities and per capita recruitment rates were strongly linked with El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Our models also estimated high apparent survival probabilities and significant increases in (sub)population sizes in both MPAs over a decade. In Dampier Strait, the estimated population size increased significantly (p = 0.018) from 226 (95% CI: 161, 283) to 317 (280, 355) individuals. Likewise, the estimated population size in SE Misool increased significantly (p = 0.008) from 210 (137, 308) to 511 (393, 618) individuals. Regardless of variation in the percentage change in population size between years throughout the study, the estimated overall population change shows a compound growth of 3.9% (0.7, 8.6) per annum in Dampier Strait and 10.7% (4.3, 16.1) per annum in SE Misool. Despite the global decline in oceanic sharks and rays due to fishing pressure in the last five decades, our study demonstrates the positive impact of a suite of long-term conservation efforts, coupled with the influence of ENSO events, on increasing M. alfredi abundance in Raja Ampat MPAs. Our study also underscores the importance of long-term monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation management measures on manta ray populations.

"Risk exploration in superimposed rift basin: case studies of Agadem/Bilma/Tenere blocks in Termit Basin, Niger","Yuan, S.; Zhai, G.; Mao, F.; Xiao, K.; Zheng, F.; He, L.; Cheng, D.; Li, Z.; Jiang, H.","Esso and other international companies had conducted exploration in Termit Basin for 36 years and withdrawn since no commercial reserves were discovered. In 2003, CNPC participated in the petroleum exploration in Termit Basin and implemented the exploration strategy of “step-by-step” by integrating the technical evaluation and business operation. On the one hand, the progressive exploration was conducted in the western part of the basin with discoveries to determine the proven reserves, and on the other hand, the main oil-bearing series and exploration orientation were defined by studying on the core geological problems. The results show that: (1) Termit Basin, a superimposed rift basin experienced two stages of rift and two stages of depression, suffered transgression in the Late Cretaceous, showing different characteristics from other continental rift basins in Central and Western Africa; (2) The main reservoir and cap rock assemblage was formed by the interbedded sandstone and mudstone in the Lower Paleogene and the regional mudstone in the Upper Paleogene; (3) The hydrocarbon accumulation mode in marine and continental superimposed rift basin was established, supporting to discover four oilfield groups with reserves of 100-million-ton level, which was a typical successful case of overseas independent exploration. The implications include: (1) The integration of technical evaluation and business operation is an important reason for block acquisition in Niger; (2) The application of petroleum geology theory and technology of continental rift basin is the prerequisite for successful exploration in Termit Basin; (3) An appropriate hydrocarbon accumulation mode is the key factor for achieving the major exploration breakthroughs in Termit Basin.

A review of ecosystem restoration: Progress and prospects of domestic and abroad,"Li, F.; Cheng, C.; Yang, R.","Climate change and increased human activity lead to ecosystem degradation, loss of biodiversity and reduced capacity to sustain the biosphere, as well as significantly constrain sustainable socio-economic development. Ecosystem degradation continues to be a global concern, and extensive conservation and restoration efforts have been implemented worldwide to address this problem. In this paper, we first explore the concepts and theories of ecosystem restoration and how they developed. Secondly, we summarize key elements associated with ecosystem restoration, e.g. ecosystem services and values, biodiversity conservation, climate change and carbon storage, nature reserves, monitoring systems and adaptive management, and equity and multi-participation. Then, we review the problem of ecosystem degradation and the extent of restoration efforts in China’s forests, grasslands, rivers and wetlands, and marine and coastal zones. We explore the progress and shortcomings of three measures, in particular, China’s ecological conservation red line scheme, ecosystem restoration in protected areas and ecological protection and restoration in national space planning. Finally, we conclude the paper by exploring integrated conservation and systematic land management approaches to address ecosystem degradation. We discuss the policies and channels of diversified financing of ecosystem restoration, exploratory practices in wilderness ecological conservation and restoration, applied research in urban ecosystem restoration, and ecosystem restoration for the conservation and maintenance of biodiversity to inform further research and practical application of ecosystem restoration efforts in China. © 2022, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Satoumi Systems Promoting Integrated Coastal Resources Management: An Empirical Review,"Kakuma, S.","Coastal areas, eco-systems, biodiversity, and fisheries resources have been devastated worldwide because of diverse reasons. In Japan, to tackle these problems, various activities have been practiced, which deeply involve local people in Satoumi. The Satoumi activities are now spreading throughout the world. These Satoumi are extremely diverse, and it is difficult to capture them with a single definition or perspective. Because social–ecological systems in Satoumi areas are extremely complicated and highly uncertain, Satoumi co-creation requires transdisciplinary approaches in which diverse stakeholders including local residents, bilateral knowledge translators, and residential and visiting scientists play important roles. This paper reviews the various types of Satoumi in Japan and around the world, and Satoumi co-creation activities through the transdisciplinary approaches from multiple perspectives. The Satoumi co-creation includes not only the traditional single approach of resource management but also approaches to enhance the resources by direct human intervention, to conserve ecosystems that support the resources, and to survey and monitor the resources by fishers. This paper also reviews the synergy and integration of fisheries and other resource management, such as tourism-related activities in marine protected areas in Satoumi. © 2022 by the author.",2022,,Sustainability (Switzerland),14,18,,,10.3390/su141811702,,#21595,Kakuma 2022,,

Evaluating governability challenges of Saint Martin's Island (SMI) in Bangladesh,"Das, J.; Kabir, M.H.; Taimur, F.M.; Hossain, M.; Kumar, U.","Saint Martin's Island (SMI), a declared marine protected area, is a unique and coral-dominated island in Bangladesh. This study explores, analyses, and describes SMI's governability challenges based on primary and secondary data. Analyses of the governance framework and mechanism show that legal instruments are diffused among multiple sectors involving interest groups and resource users both within and beyond the island. The conflicting interests of different actors and resource users simultaneously generate a complex web of intertwined demands. Hence, we did not find the existing hierarchical governance system responsive to the challenges posed by natural and anthropogenic stressors in SMI. We applied different governance mechanisms along with interactions between the systems-to-be-governed and the governing system, suggesting that governance needs to be adaptive, interactive, participatory, and connected with management objectives of the ecosystems. The governance modes must match with existing realities so that human-nature interactions can sustain. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,World Development Perspectives,27,,,,10.1016/j.wdp.2022.100434,,#21599,Das 2022,,
The structure of the mangrove forests of Kiunga-Pate Island conservancies in Kenya are shaped by selective harvesting and natural mortalities,"Okello, J.A.; Osuka, K.E.; Maina, G.W.; Mbugua, J.; Samoilys, M.A.","Lamu archipelago is endowed with rich biodiversity including Kenya's largest continuous acreage of mangroves (approx. 33,000 ha) among other ecosystems making it a hotspot for management and conservation efforts. Yet, the involvement of the local community in management in this area is still in its infancy, with threats from large-scale developments, population growth, and climate change on the rise. Here, the structural status of the mangroves around Pate Island and Kiunga Marine National Reserve (KMNR) was assessed and information applied to guide and promote community-based conservation, as well as the development of the national mangrove management plan. Stratified and random spot sampling was used to collect vegetation data and mapping undertaken to estimate the mangrove cover change between 1995 and 2014. There was a loss in mangrove cover of up to 22.6% over 19years. A substantial loss was associated with illegal selective harvesting outside the KMNR, some clear-cutting to pave way for large-scale development and natural mortality of overgrown mature trees within the KMNR. In particular, natural mortality was found to hinder natural regeneration within the KMNR. The results however showed a generally stable system with potentially sustainable levels of natural regeneration and recoveries in isolated patches. These results reveal two management actions: raising awareness of mangrove ecosystems' ecological value and controlling old-growth harvesting in the KMNR to facilitate natural regeneration and development of young vigorous forest through gap creation. This information provides a strong foundation for conservation planning including future mangrove restoration and conservation activities. A comprehensive coordinated conservation strategy that links conservation to communities, livelihoods, and governance frameworks is recommended. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science",272,,,,10.1016/j.ecss.2022.107885,,#21600,Okello 2022,,
The COVID-19 pandemic has altered illegal fishing activities inside and outside a marine protected area,"Quimbayo, J.P.; Silva, F.C.; Barreto, C.R.; Pavone, C.B.; Lefcheck, J.S.; Leite, K.; Figueiroa, A.C.; Correia, E.C.; Flores, A.A.V.","The global COVID-19 pandemic has presented a unique opportunity to explore the consequences of illegal exploitation on wildlife communities, as it continues to have wide-reaching impacts on multiple sectors, including local and national economies, international trade, and conservation enforcement1. The ongoing reductions in monitoring and enforcement during the pandemic have allowed increased opportunities for illegal, unreported, and unregulated activities, particularly for small-scale fisheries2. Even before the pandemic, policymakers and fisheries managers intent on controlling illegal fishing activities established marine protected areas (MPAs) that restrict or prohibit fishing3. Unfortunately, non-compliance with MPAs is often the rule rather than the exception, and less than 10% of the world's MPAs have managed to effectively reduce infringement4. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these management challenges: a recent review of MPAs worldwide has revealed a general decline in tourism revenue to operate park services during the pandemic, especially revenue needed for supporting personnel to monitor, patrol, and enforce restrictions2. Here, we compile infraction records of illegal fishing activities by both professional (commercial) and amateur (recreational) boats inside and outside of the Tupinambás Ecological Station and the Alcatrazes Wildlife Refuge (Figure 1A), notable for its high reef-fish biomass and diversity in the Southwestern Atlantic5.

Balancing public acceptability and consensus regarding marine protected areas management using the Potential for Conflict Index2,"Engel, M.T.; Vaske, J.J.","Implementing marine protected areas and deciding what activities should be permitted can result in public conflict. The Potential for Conflict Index2 has assessed the likelihood of conflicts across various contexts but has not yet been applied to managing marine protected areas. This article examined levels of consensus or potential conflict across various management options before implementing a new MPA. The options ranged from no-take to allowing oil drilling. Data from the island of Newfoundland, Canada, showed that despite public support for full protection (M =0.64 ± 1.08), a higher potential for conflict was observed for not allowing small-scale fishing (PCI2 = 0.30) and closing the area for any human activity (PCI2 = 0.26). A lower potential for conflict/higher consensus was observed for not allowing industrial fishing (PCI2 = 0.13) and oil exploration (PCI2 = 0.14). Levels of consensus did not differ statistically between closing the area and allowing small-scale fishing (d = 1.82, p &gt; .05), but differed between the other options. Understanding public acceptability for MPAs and identifying areas of potential conflict may increase the likelihood of successfully implementing new areas for biodiversity conservation and meeting the global targets of ocean protection. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Marine Policy,139,,,,10.1016/j.marpol.2022.105042,,#21618,Engel 2022,,
CONSERVATION OR DEGRADATION? ASSESSING THE BEHAVIOR OF UNDERWATER PHOTOGRAPHERS IN ITALIAN MARINE PROTECTED AREAS,"Toso, Y.; Lucrezi, S.; Cerrano, C.","Underwater photography is increasing in popularity. It can have positive effects such as conservation awareness and citizen science. Often, however, photographers neglect good environmental practices and engage in potentially damaging behaviors to the marine environment. The management of underwater photography is particularly relevant in marine protected areas (MPAs), where uses of the marine environment need to be carefully balanced. This study aimed to assess and compare underwater photographers’ and nonphotographers’ knowledge of codes of conduct in MPAs, as well as self-reported and observed compliance with these codes of conduct, and perceptions of the health of the marine environment including dive sites. Through direct observations and questionnaires, 84 divers were studied in three Italian MPAs in the summer of 2021. The difference between underwater photographers and nonphotographers was stark, with the former being more likely to violate MPA rules compared to the latter. There was no difference in knowledge of the effects of their behavior on the marine environment between underwater photographers and nonphotographers. Our results can help provide management considerations to reduce the impacts of underwater photography. Awareness campaigns, predive briefings and the promotion of low-impact underwater photography courses can help to limit unsustainable underwater behaviors among underwater photographers. Effective regulation of underwater photography can increase the carrying capacity of dive sites and have positive environmental and economic effects on MPAs and diving destinations. © 2022 Cognizant, LLC",2022,,Tourism in Marine Environments,17,3,127-143,,10.3727/154427322X16609069005675,,#21629,Toso 2022,,

We observed an unequal representativeness and influence of the sectors within the council. The environmental non-governmental organizations/research, tourism, teaching/scientific research and the federal and state executive powers strongly influenced the decision making, while the fishing sector and the residents had moderate and weak participation.

Tectonically, the main part of these areas stretches across the global tectonic-metallogenic domain of Paleo-Asian and Tethys Ocean, and has experienced complex geological evolution processes including supercontinent breakup, convergence, accretion, assemblage and multi-stage mineralization and formed many world-class mineral deposits and petroliferous basins. The reserves of petroleum, natural gas, uranium, copper, chromium, gold, manganese, lead, zinc, potassium salt, Boron, graphite and other mineral resources in these areas rank among the top in the world. Most of the countries in the region are mainly resource-driven economy, with mining or petroleum gas industries as their pillar industries, and have strong will for international technical cooperation and exchange on geoscientific research, geological survey and mineral exploration, so as to serve and promote the sustainable development of mining. This paper gives a brief review of the basic situation of international cooperation between Xi'an Geological Survey Center and the countries in Central Asia, Western Asia and Eastern Europe in the past 20 years, and introduces the mainly progresses and achievements on comprehensive mapping of geology, mineral resources, geochemistry, and the geological comparing of cross-border metallogenic belts and assessing of mineral resources potential, et on, all of which are important for jointly building the Belt and Road Initiative.

"IDENTIFICATION OF MARINE IMPORTANT CONSERVATION AREAS FOR MEDITERRANEAN STORM PETRELS HYDROBATES PELAGICUS MELITENSIS BREEDING IN SARDINIA, ITALY","DE Pascalis, F.; Pisu, D.; Pala, D.; Benvenuti, A.; Visalli, F.; Carlon, E.; Serra, L.; Rubolini, D.; Cecere, J.G.","Marine predators are an important component of marine trophic webs, and their decline has important consequences on whole ecosystem dynamics. Understanding their movements and habits is vital for conservation, yet extremely challenging. Tracking technologies, coupled with a robust, reproducible, and quantitative analytical framework, are being used to successfully identify Important Conservation Areas (ICAs) for seabirds, which are wide-ranging and declining marine predators. However, the identification of such areas is skewed towards large-bodied seabird species, and there are few marine ICAs for small-bodied birds like storm petrels. We GPS-tracked Mediterranean Storm Petrels Hydrobates pelagicus melitensis breeding in northwestern Sardinia over three consecutive breeding seasons (2019–2021), and we applied a recently proposed analytical framework for the assessment of ICAs using GPS data. We identified an area of 40 638 km2 in the central Mediterranean Sea that spans three different national marine jurisdictions and partially falls within the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals. In these ICAs, a range of human activities take place (e.g., fishing activities, maritime traffic, tanker maritime routes), particularly in the neritic zones. Despite the relatively low human presence in the area, the human impact on the Mediterranean Sea is predicted to increase in future years, with important consequences for conservation. International cooperation to identify ICAs at the basin scale is needed, given the trans-national nature of storm petrel movements. Here, we describe the polygon of the identified ICAs for the Italian population of Mediterranean Storm Petrel we studied (available for download) to help inform marine spatial planning and target the conservation and protection of the species. © 2022, Marine Ornithology.

Marine-protected areas and plastic pollution,"Bonanno, G.","Marine-protected areas (MPAs) are one of the most popular ways for the management and sustainable use of sea resources. However, the global pervasiveness and high abundance of plastic debris in the marine environment are growing threats also for MPAs. Artificial borders cannot stop plastics from entering MPAs and posing risks to vulnerable habitats and species. Plastic debris on the remote beaches of protected oceanic islands is now comparable to more populated and industrialized shores. As the total removal of plastics from MPAs is practically impossible, policies should target the root causes of marine plastic pollution, such as inadequate waste management and poor environmental awareness. International cooperation, enforced controls, regular monitoring, socioenvironmental programs, mainly targeted to tourists and beach users, and integrated prevention strategies are essential to address plastic pollution in MPAs. Further steps for the optimal management of MPAs should aim to improve the efficiency of the whole plastic waste management cycle, thus preventing and reducing debris entering the marine environment. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Omnidiversity Consolidation of Conservation Assessment: Case Study of Tasmanian A Coastal Geoconservation Sites,"Crisp, JRA; Ellison, JC; Fischer, A","The exclusivity of biodiversity and geodiversity assessment hinders conservation outcomes, evidenced by the prioritization of biodiversity in conservation literature, and lagging developmental state in geodiversity assessment approaches, geoconservation strategies and outcomes. This study develops a consolidated approach, ""omnidiversity"", amalgamating geodiversity and biodiversity assessment with geoconservation strategies and complementary ecological conservation criteria using ArcG1S mobile applications. ArcGIS Survey123 was adapted to assess geodiversity, biodiversity, geoconservation criteria and values. ArcGIS FicldMaps facilitated capturing the spatial location of biodiversity and geodiversity features. Three coastal geoconservation sites - Don Heads, Penguin Megabreccia, and Mersey Bluff - on the north-west coast of Tasmania were used as case studies. Results showed highest geodiversity (43.7), species richness (141) and visible interactions between geodiversity and biodiversity (120) at Don Heads geoconservation site, followed by geodiversity (40.5), species richness (107) and interactions (76) at Penguin Megabreccia site, and lowest geodiversity (7.3), species richness (89) and interactions (28) at the Mersey Bluff site. Omnidiversity showed biodiversity at Don Heads as most sensitive to geodiversity degradation attributed to extensive visible interactions, high conservation value, and the presence of sensitive species like the Little Penguin; tblIoned by Penguin Megabreccia and Mersey Bluff coastal geoconservation sites. Omnidiversity allowed time-effective and cost-effective methods to simultaneously assess geodiversity and biodiversity, determine the harboring capacity of geodiversity for biodiversity, and facilitate conservation through unification of disparate steps into one streamlined approach. Using traditional geoconservation strategies, biodiversity values are excluded, and geodiversity elements are conserved only for their geoheritage importance. Omnidiversity enabled effective assessment of vulnerable environments and has potential to benefit other holistic approaches such as the conserving nature's stage approach and ecosystem-based management Subsequent research could augment omnidiversity with other traditional biodiversity assessment approaches and conservation strategies, further trial in other ecosystems, and develop an optimized third-party digital application to provide greater availability for use.",2022,,GEOCONSERVATION RESEARCH,5,1,108-134,WOS:000895758500006,10.30486/GCR.2022.1947195.1099,,#21666,Crisp 2022,,

Women's experiences in influencing and shaping small-scale fisheries governance,"Galappaththi, M; Armitage, D; Collins, AM","This paper synthesizes current empirical evidence on how women experience, shape and influence small-scale fisheries (SSF) governance. Our synthesis addresses an important gap in the literature, and helps highlight the opportunities to improve women's participation in governance and advance gender equality. We identified, characterized and synthesized 54 empirical cases at the intersection of gender and SSF governance, which comprise the relevant body of literature. Our review confirms the need to embed gender in the empirical examination of SSF governance towards expanding the current evidence base on this topic. We found that the institutional contexts within which women participate reflect a broad spectrum of arrangements, including the interactions with rules and regulations; participatory arrangements such as co-management; and informal norms, customary practices and relational spaces. We also synthesized a typology of governance tasks performed by women in SSF. The typology includes leadership roles and active participation in decision-making; relational networking and collective action; exercising agency and legitimacy; resource monitoring; knowledge sharing; meeting attendance (with no/less participation in decision-making); and activism and mass mobilization. Furthermore, we drew broader insights based on the patterns that emerged across the literature and highlighted implications for improving women's meaningful participation in SSF governance. For example, exploring the breadth of governance arrangements to include all governance spaces where women are active, adjusting governance arrangements to respond to current and emerging barriers, and recognizing how women's efforts link with societal values may help legitimize their representation in SSF governance.

To do so, an in-field participatory research was done in five villages adjacent to Gorgan Gulf in 2020 using semi-structured interviews and focused group discussion with 48 knowledgeable Turkmen fishers through snowball sampling method. The result showed that Turkmen fishers carried extensive body of knowledge about fish species, their characteristics (size, weight, morphology, behavior), traditional fishing calendar and factors affecting it (including fish spawning time, weather condition, wind types), fishing location, orientation and navigation in fishing, fishing tools and equipment and methods of net placement. Turkmen fishers also described how the quantity, quality and diversity of fish has drastically decreased over time and they mentioned six main reasons for that including exchange of paddling and rowing boats for motor boats; adoption of galvanized nets which replaced cotton nets; decreased possibility and condition of spawning; degradation of shore habitats and decline in fish food leading to fish migration; destruction of small lakes and wetlands adjacent to Caspian Sea and overfishing. In conclusion, considering the role of small-scale fishers in human well-being and food security, their Indigenous and local knowledge must be taken into consideration for natural resources management and conservation.[GRAPHICS]",,,REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES,,,,WOS:000900065200001,10.1007/s11160-022-09746-3,,#21681,,,
Characteristics of Small-Scale Coastal Fisheries in China and Suggested Improvements in Management Strategies: A Case Study From Shengsi County in Zhejiang Province,"Xiong, MS; Wu, ZL; Tang, Y; Su, S; Shen, HH","Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) in China have made incalculable contributions to the supply of aquatic products, employment, and social stability. Despite their importance, aspects such as the complexity, dynamicity, and vulnerability of SSFs are yet to receive sufficient attention either from the Chinese government or from society. Here we help to address the lack of recognition of SSFs by examining their characteristics and possible management solutions. We selected Shengsi County, a community with traditional fishing activities, in Zhejiang Province as a case study to review and examine the SSFs' characteristics and policies. We aimed to explore the improvement strategies for Chinese SSF management by using data from the open-access government databases, a series of questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews, and a collection of national and local SSF-related legislative and policy documents. Here we summarized the physical characteristics of the small-scale fishing vessels and the socioeconomic aspects of SSFs in Shengsi County. Our findings indicate that unprecedented new institutional arrangements for SSFs have been developed in recent years at the national level, and some relevant policies of SSFs also exist at the local level. However, there are still gaps: The concept of SSFs and the goal of their management have not been developed either at the national or local levels; monitoring systems have not yet been established for collecting SSF-related data; fishers engaged in SSFs are still not well organized; cooperation and coordination between different government departments with management authority over SSFs are insufficient; the local government's response to the central government's initiatives was slow. Our findings show that the Chinese government could improve SSF management by adopting on an ongoing basis the following suggestions: (1) better define SSFs and set management goals according to their characteristics; (2) develop a monitoring system for SSFs' data and information collection and promote multidisciplinary research on SSFs; (3) establish SSFs' cooperatives as soon as possible; and (4) develop coordination and cooperation mechanisms among government departments. This research can provide a reference for the Chinese government to understand SSFs better and contribute to the implementation and improvement of SSFs' differentiated management in China.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,9,,,WOS:000817970200001,10.3389/fmars.2022.811382,,#21685,Xiong 2022,,
Reviewing relational values for future research: insights from the coast,"Riechers, M; Betz, L; Gould, RK; Loch, TK; Lam, DPM; Lazzari, N; Martin-Lopez, B; Sala, JE","To create the science we need for the ocean we want in this United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and to support the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) value assessment, we systematically reviewed literature from the past 20 years (N = 375) that used conceptualizations of relational values in coastal and marine ecosystems of the Global South. We found four clusters of research highlighting specific characteristics. Cluster one (participatory and qualitative approaches) was defined by a focus on the relational value of cultural heritage and the production of qualitative social science data, often with a participatory approach. Cluster two (Indigenous and local ecological knowledges held by fishers and gatherers) linked to the explicit inclusion of Indigenous and local knowledges in research and to aspects of biodiversity and marine resources. Cluster three (ecological and environmental change) was determined by relational values of social relations and identity of residents and community members through the use of anthropological and ethnographic methods and linked to ecological and environmental change. Cluster four (recreation and quantitative data) was characterized by a variety of relational values, such as recreation and enjoyment, aesthetics and inspiration, or stewardship, and based on quantitative empirical social research methods mainly elicited from coastal users (such as tourists). We highlight (1) the most prevalent relational values; (2) the necessity to bridge dispersed research approaches; and (3) the possible negative impact of globalization, market pressure, and ecological degradation on relational values. Our lessons learnt are the challenge of conflating relational values with structures, institutions, or emotions; the necessity of accounting for dynamic influences on relational values; and finding ways to comparably quantify relational value categories. Our recommendations for future research are: (1) specificity regarding relational values and their object of value; (2) using transdisciplinary and participatory approaches; and (3) strengthening pro-environmental relational values for sustainability transformation.",2022,,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,27,4,,WOS:000905258300001,10.5751/ES-13710-270444,,#21686,Riechers 2022,,
Disentangling tourism impacts on small-scale fishing pressure,"Miller, KM","Tourism and small-scale fisheries are two of the most important economic sectors in coastal areas around the world, yet the impact of tourism development on fisheries is understudied within the SSF literature. Studies have documented various aspects of tourism-fishery interactions, but it is not clear how they combine to impact total fishing pressure. The addition of alternative livelihoods is widely expected to alleviate pressure on fisheries resources, yet rural development transitions often accelerate exploitation of natural resources. This paper analyzes how tourism development impacts community-level fishing pressure through a comparative case study of fishing behavior and livelihood engagement in seven neighboring fishing communities in the Colombian Pacific, using space-for-time substitution to estimate change over time. Findings indicate that while tourism development leads to a decline in fishery participation, this decline can be more than offset by increases in fishing effort and improvements in fishing methods. This is related to an overall pattern of livelihood specialization and intensification that results in a divergence of household-level fishing behavior - between those that exit the fishery and those that fish more intensively - and an increase in community-wide fishing pressure. However, impacts vary from place to place due to contextual factors in the biophysical environment and socio-political systems that shape how tourism development affects fishing behavior and whether or not it is likely to benefit sustainable small-scale fisheries. These findings can be used to support place-based assessments in order to anticipate impacts, proactively design fisheries management, and inform more sustainable tourism development planning.",2022,,MARINE POLICY,137,,,WOS:000779336900009,10.1016/j.marpol.2022.104960,,#21689,Miller 2022,,
"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid biomarkers and risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality","Jiang, H; Wang, LN; Wang, DL; Yan, N; Li, C; Wu, M; Wang, F; Mi, BB; Chen, FY; Jia, WR; Liu, X; Lv, JX; Liu, Y; Lin, J; Ma, L","Background & aims: Considerable attention has focused on the role of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the prevention of cardiometabolic diseases, which has led to dietary recommendations to increase omega-3 fatty acid intake. A meta-analysis was conducted to summarize evidence from prospective studies regarding associations between omega-3 PUFA biomarkers and risk of developing major chronic diseases.Methods: Four electronic databases were searched for articles from inception to March 1, 2022. Random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of omega-3 PUFAs, including ci-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), with risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, cancer, and mortality. The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation assessment tool was used to rates the confidence in estimates.Results: A total of 67 prospective studies comprised of 310,955 participants were identified. Individual omega-3 PUFAs showed divergent associations with the study outcomes of interest. A significant inverse association with T2D risk was observed across categories of ALA (relative risk [RR]: 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82-0.96), EPA (RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.72-0.99) and DPA (RR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.73-0.96) biomarkers. The marine-origin omega-3 fatty acids biomarkers but not ALA was significantly associated with lower risks of total CVD, CHD, and overall mortality, with RRs ranging from 0.70 for DHA-CHD association to 0.85 for EPA-CHD association. A lower risk of colorectal cancer was observed at higher levels of DPA (RR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59-0.98) and DHA (RR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.65-0.99), whereas no association was noted for other outcomes. In addition, a dose-response relationship was observed between an increasing level of EPA, DPA, or DHA biomarker and lower risk of CVD.Conclusions: Higher concentrations of marine-derived omega-3 PUFA biomarkers were associated with a significantly reduced risk of total CVD, CHD, and total mortality. Levels of ALA were inversely associated with a lower risk of T2D but not CVD-related outcomes. These data support the dietary recommendations advocating the role of omega-3 PUFAs in maintaining an overall lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease and premature deaths.

"Exploring the management policy of marine microplastic litter in China: Overview, challenges and prospects","Yu, JK; Ma, XY","Marine microplastic pollution has been a serious problem in recent years, threatening people's health. The Chinese government has promulgated a series of policies to manage marine microplastics. Analysis of marine microplastic litter management policies is necessary to improve the management of marine microplastics and coordinate the reduction of plastic waste generation. Based on 171 policy documents, this paper uses literature and content analysis methods to analyze the policies since 2016 using ROSTCM6 software. These policies start with curbing the sources and monitoring the presence of marine microplastic litter. The study found that policy management shows the characteristics of insisting on land and sea integration, strengthening plastic waste recycling, strengthening scientific and technological support, and coordinating ex-ante monitoring and ex-post assessment. Although the Chinese government has made progress in marine microplastic litter management policies. However, further development is still needed in terms of the management system, multi-subject collaboration, division of responsibilities among management departments, and public awareness. Finally, this paper emphasizes the need to improve the management policy, focus on technology, encourage the participation of multiple subjects, strengthen education, and establish an integrated management mechanism for land and sea.

Strategic planning of bio-based supply chains: Unlocking bottlenecks and incorporating social sustainability into biorefinery systems,"Cerca, M; Sosa, A; Gusciute, E; Murphy, F","The sourcing of renewable bio-resources and their conversion through novel biorefinery technology is being sup- ported by several initiatives and policies worldwide involving the development of a circular bioeconomy. How- ever, further questions remain unanswered such as how the strategic planning of new bio-based supply chains could contribute to sustainability targets given the common oversight for the social dimension in decision - making levels of biorefinery supply chains. Based on a systematic literature review of research papers on biorefineries, bottlenecks associated with the strategic planning of new supply chains from feedstocks originating from land and marine ecosystems were identified, along with the aspects currently representing the social di- mension of sustainability. The results outline two main findings. First, the bottlenecks identified and portrayed by grass and seaweed-based supply chains can be summed into the following main categories: bio-resource availability, quality, logistic planning, economic, ecological, and social issues, policy, research and innovation. Sec- ond, current research at the strategic decision-making levels of biorefineries is substantially focused on techno- economic aspects. The inclusion of environmental aspects has been increasing with life cycle assessment meth- odologies in more recent years, while social elements remain widely disregarded. The results further uncover the social dimension, represented by aspects such as employment creation, participation of primary producers, food and energy security, stakeholders' engagement, societal acceptance, effects on local communities, workers' well- being, education, gender equality, cultural values, and potential conflicts. To overcome bottlenecks and incorpo- rate social dimensions, new perspectives and interdisciplinarity are needed to extrapolate the boundaries of analytical frameworks currently adopted by biorefinery research. We suggest framing the planning of new bio- based supply chains within a socio-technical-ecological system to pursue integrated strategies toward more sus- tainable and socially relevant biorefinery systems.

The variability in the structural and functional properties of coccolith base plates,"Eyal, Z; Krounbi, L; Ben Joseph, O; Avrahami, EM; Pinkas, I; Peled-Zehavi, H; Gal, A","Biomineralization processes exert varying levels of control over crystallization, ranging from poorly or-dered polycrystalline arrays to intricately shaped single crystals. Coccoliths, calcified scales formed by unicellular algae, are a model for a highly controlled crystallization process. The coccolith crystals nucle-ate next to an organic oval structure that was termed the base plate, leading to the assumption that it is responsible for the oriented nucleation of the crystals via stereochemical interactions. In recent years, several works focusing on a well-characterized model species demonstrated a fundamental role for indi-rect interactions that facilitate coccolith crystallization. Here, we developed the tools to extract the base plates from five different species, giving the opportunity to systematically explore the relations between base plate and coccolith properties. We used multiple imaging techniques to evaluate the structural and chemical features of the base plates under native hydrated conditions. The results show a wide range of properties, overlaid on a common rudimentary scaffold that lacks any detectable structural or chem-ical motifs that can explain direct nucleation control. This work emphasizes that it is the combination between the base plate and the chemical environment inside the cell that cooperatively facilitate the exquisite control over the crystallization process.Statement of significance Biological organic scaffolds can serve as functional surfaces that guide the formation of inorganic ma-terials. However, in many cases the specific interactions that facilitate such tight regulation are complex and not fully understood. In this work, we elucidate the architecture of such amodel biological template, an organic scale that directs the assembly of exquisite crystalline arrays of marine microalgae. By us-ing cryo electron microscopy, we reveal the native state organization of these scales from several species. The observed similarities and differences allow us to propose that the chemical microenvironment, rather than stereochemical matching, is the pivotal regulator of the process.(c) 2022 Acta Materialia Inc.

Impacts of COVID-19 on at-sea data collection and regulatory activities and fisheries catches off Namibia,"Erasmus, VN; Tutjavi, V; Konstantinus, A; Uahengo, T; Ndara, S","This study was undertaken to: (i) comprehend the observers' perceptions of COVID-19 and identify its impacts on the observation of harvesting, handling, and processing of marine resources, and biological data collection during commercial fishing, (ii) assess the risk of contracting COVID-19 onboard the fishing vessels, (iii) compare fishery catches for the pre-COVID-19 (2018 and 2019) and COVID19 (2020 and 2021) years, and (iv) suggest possible ways to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on the activities of at sea-observations and data collection. Thus, 45 Namibian fisheries observers were interviewed by telephone to capture their perceptions of COVID-19 on the sea-observations and biological data collection. Messrooms were the riskiest places (45.7%) onboard the fishing vessel where observers perceived likely to contract COVID-19. For at-sea observations, 57.1% of the respondents felt that COVID-19 has negatively impacted observations as fisheries observers were risk-averse, especially in the processing factories. Half of the participants purported a negative impact on the collection of biological data, as on some vessels fisheries observers were not permitted to sample the fish supposedly for fear of cross-contamination. Analysis of fisheries observation data and fisheries catch data showed a significant difference in the total number of fishing trips made between 2018 and 2021 (X-2 = 145.34, df = 3, p < 0.05), with a notable reduction in 2020 fishing trips. Similarly, the number of observed fishing trips between 2018 and 2021 differed significantly (X-2 = 136.80, df = 3, p < 0.05). Fishing catches were lowest in 2020, possibly reflecting severe impacts of COVID-19 in that year. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on at-sea observation and data collection can inform decision makers to improve management of marine resources during COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from this study can also serve as a lesson for nations that use observer data for stock assessment. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

"An issue-oriented framework for Marine Spatial Planning-A case study of Koh Lan, Thailand","Zhang, ZW; Plathong, S; Sun, YG; Guo, Z; Ma, C; Jantharakhantee, C; Tanboot, L","Marine spatial planning (MSP) is adopted as an effective marine resource management tool worldwide to balance the growing development needs and marine conservation. However, the launch of MSP in some countries is still in its infancy due to lack of capacity to compile MSP, such as insufficient financial support, ineffective marine governance system and limited data. To implement MSP within the limitation of capacity, an effective solution would be to target at reconciling the principal contradiction between exploitation and conservation. An issue-oriented framework of MSP for spatial planning was proposed to deal with the constraint and applied it successfully in Koh Lan, Thailand. The framework consists of four layers, namely the layer of issues, the layer of survey and data collection, the layer of analysis, and the layer of policy making. By identifying main conflicts and problems on the island, four thematic analyses were conducted: topographic factor assessment land-based sewage outlet analysis, hydrodynamic characteristics and sewage discharge, habitat quality of the island and its surrounding waters and the island tourism environment based on tourists' perception, and finally form the MSP plan based on the analyses and stakeholder participation. Lessons learned were highlighted that: (1) Data-driven MSP is fundamental to improve scientificity; (2) Issue-oriented MSP is an effective way of regional marine management and (3) Government impetus and coordination between government and stakeholders is an important guarantee to promote the implementation of MSP. The issue-oriented framework for MSP provides a solution to the problem of slow MSP progress due to inadequate capacity. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The ADVANCE and MOTIVATE studies showed that intravenous risankizumab, a selective p19 anti-interleukin (IL)-23 antibody, was efficacious and well tolerated as induction therapy. Here, we report the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous risankizumab as maintenance therapy.Methods FORTIFY is a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, maintenance withdrawal study across 273 clinical centres in 44 countries across North and South America, Europe, Oceania, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region that enrolled participants with clinical response to risankizumab in the ADVANCE or MOTIVATE induction studies. Patients in ADVANCE or MOTIVATE were aged 16-80 years with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Patients in the FORTIFY substudy 1 were randomly assigned again (1:1:1) to receive either subcutaneous risankizumab 180 mg, subcutaneous risankizumab 360 mg, or withdrawal from risankizumab to receive subcutaneous placebo (herein referred to as withdrawal [subcutaneous placebo]). Treatment was given every 8 weeks. Patients were stratified by induction dose, post-induction endoscopic response, and clinical remission status. Patients, investigators, and study personnel were masked to treatment assignments. Week 52 co-primary endpoints were clinical remission (Crohn's disease activity index [CDAI] in the US protocol, or stool frequency and abdominal pain score in the non-US protocol) and endoscopic response in patients who received at least one dose of study drug during the 52-week maintenance period. Safety was assessed in patients receiving at least one dose of study medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03105102.Findings 712 patients were initially assessed and, between April 9, 2018, and April 24, 2020, 542 patients were randomly assigned to either the risankizumab 180 mg group (n=179), the risankizumab 360 mg group (n= 179), or the placebo group (n=184). Greater clinical remission and endoscopic response rates were reached with 360 mg risankizumab versus placebo (CDAI clinical remission was reached in 74 (52%) of 141 patients vs 67 (41%) of 164 patients, adjusted difference 15% [95% CI 5-24]; stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission was reached in 73 (52%) of 141 vs 65 (40%) of 164, adjusted difference 15% [5-25]; endoscopic response 66 (47%) of 141 patients vs 36 (22%) of 164 patients, adjusted difference 28% [19-37]). Higher rates of CDAI clinical remission and endoscopic response (but not stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission [p=0.124]) were also reached with risankizumab 180 mg versus withdrawal (subcutaneous placebo; CDAI clinical remission reached in 87 [55%] of 157 patients, adjusted difference 15% [95% CI 5-24]; endoscopic response 74 [47%] of 157, adjusted difference 26% [17-35]). Results for more stringent endoscopic and composite endpoints and inflammatory biomarkers were consistent with a dose-response relationship. Maintenance treatment was well tolerated. Adverse event rates were similar among groups, and the most frequently reported adverse events in all treatment groups were worsening Crohn's disease, arthralgia, and headache.Interpretation Subcutaneous risankizumab is a safe and efficacious treatment for maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and offers a new therapeutic option for a broad range of patients by meeting endpoints that might change the future course of disease.

Social rank and species-specific differences influence cooperation and conflict in anemonefish societies,"Rueger, T; Heatwole, SJ; Wong, MYL","Many animal groups consist of dominance hierarchies. Theoretical models suggest that higher-ranked individuals should increase aggression but should decrease helping unless the cost of helping de-creases with higher rank. Most empirical tests focus on systems with kin selection, whereas tests for groups in which individuals are unrelated are rare. Here we used two anemonefish species to test hy-potheses of variation in helping and aggression with respect to social rank. We assessed behavioural frequencies for each rank in Amphiprion percula and A. perideraion groups and performed a removal experiment to determine whether behaviours were rank-or size-specific. Overall, we found A. perideraion performed more aggression and less helping than A. percula, possibly due to a difference in ecological constraints. In both species, we found consistent differences in behaviour between ranks, with higher ranks performing both aggression and helping more often. Despite low relatedness within groups, we found that lower-ranked individuals helped in both species. When we experimentally promoted individuals and controlled for group size, their behaviour became indistinguishable from that of in-dividuals established in the higher rank. Thus, for the first time, we quantified helping for nonbreeding individuals in a marine fish, showed that behavioural patterns are rank-specific, and confirmed that individuals adjust both aggression and helping to their likelihood of inheriting a breeding position.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.
