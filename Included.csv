Citizen science monitoring of marine protected areas: Case studies and recommendations for integration into monitoring programs,"Freiwald, J; Meyer, R; Caselle, JE; Blanchette, CA; Hovel, K; Neilson, D; Dugan, J; Altstatt, J; Nielsen, K; Bursek, J","Ecosystem-based management and conservation approaches such as marine protected areas (MPAs) require large amounts of ecological data to be implemented and adaptively managed. Recently, many citizen science programs have endeavored to help provide these much-needed data. Implementation of MPAs under the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) Initiative in Southern California was followed by a monitoring program to establish a comprehensive baseline of the ecological conditions of several marine ecosystems at the time of MPA implementation. This baseline monitoring consortium involved several citizen science monitoring programs alongside more traditional academic monitoring programs, creating an opportunity to evaluate the potential for citizen scientists to become more involved in future long-term monitoring efforts. We investigated different citizen science models, their program goals, and contributions to MPA baseline monitoring, including their respective monitoring protocols and data quality assurance measures, in the context of the goals of the MLPA baseline monitoring program. We focused on three very different case studies: (i) commercial fishermen and other volunteers collaborating with researchers to study the California spiny lobster, (ii) volunteer divers monitoring rocky reefs with the Reef Check California (RCCA) program and (iii) middle and high school students monitoring the inter-tidal life of rocky shore and sandy beach ecosystems with the National Marine Sanctuaries' Long-term Monitoring Program and Experiential Training for Students (LiMPETS) program. We elucidate capacities and potential of citizen science approaches for MPA baseline monitoring and for building capacity towards sustainable long-term monitoring of MPAs. Results from this study will be relevant and timely as the monitoring of California's MPAs transitions from baseline to long-term monitoring, and as citizen science continues to become more prevalent in California and elsewhere.",2018,,MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE,39,,,WOS:000434150100002,10.1111/maec.12470,,#19184,Freiwald 2018,,
Can citizen science contribute to fish assemblages monitoring in understudied areas? The case study of Tunisian marine protected areas,"Ben Lamine, E; Di Franco, A; Romdhane, MS; Francour, P","Resource monitoring is a key issue in ecosystem management especially for marine protected areas (MPAs), where information on the composition and structure of fish assemblages is crucial to design a sound management plan. Data on fish assemblage are usually collected using Underwater Visual Censuses (UVC). However, fish assemblages monitoring in MPAs usually calls for considerable resources in terms of costs, time and technical/scientific skills. Financial resources and trained scientific divers may, however, not be available in certain geographical areas, that are thus understudied. Therefore, involving citizen volunteer divers in fish assemblage monitoring and adopting easy-to-use underwater visual census methods could be an effective way to collect crucial data. Citizen science can be used only if it can provide information that is consistent with that collected using standard scientific monitoring. Here, we aim to: 1) compare the consistency of results from a Standard scientific UVC (S-UVC) and an Easy-to-use UVC (E-UVC) method in assessing fish assemblage spatial variability, and 2) test the consistency of data collected by Scientific Divers (SD) and Scientifically Trained Volunteer divers (STV), using E-UVC. We used, in two consecutive years, three Tunisian future Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and adjacent areas as case studies. E-UVC and S-UVC data were consistent in highlighting the same spatial patterns for the three MPAs (between MPAs and, inside and outside each one). No significant difference was recorded between data collected by SD or STV. Our results suggest that E-UVC can provide information representing simplified proxies for describing fish assemblages and can therefore be a valuable tool for fish monitoring by citizen divers in understudied areas. This evidence could foster citizen science as an effective tool to raise environmental awareness and involve stakeholders in resource management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Long-term participation in collaborative fisheries research improves angler opinions on marine protected areas,"Mason, ET; Kellum, AN; Chiu, JA; Waltz, GT; Murray, S; Wendt, DE; Starr, RM; Semmens, BX","Recent marine spatial planning efforts, including the management and monitoring of marine protected areas (MPAs), increasingly focus on the importance of stakeholder engagement. For nearly 15 years, the California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program (CCFRP) has partnered volunteer anglers with researchers, the fishing industry, and resource managers to monitor groundfishes in California's network of MPAs. While the program has succeeded in generating sustained biological observations, we know little about volunteer angler demography or the impact of participation on their perceptions and opinions on fisheries data or MPAs. In this study we surveyed CCFRP volunteers to learn about (a) volunteer angler demographics and attitudes toward groundfish management and stock health, (b) volunteer angler motivations for joining and staying in the program, and (c) whether participation in the program influenced volunteer angler opinions on the quality of fisheries data used in resource management and the establishment of MPAs in California. CCFRP volunteers were older and had higher fishing avidity than average within the California recreational angling community. Many self-identified as more conservation-minded than their peers in the recreational fishing community and had positive views of California groundfish management and stock health. Participation in science and giving back to fisheries resources were major motivating factors in their decision to become and remain CCFRP volunteers. Angler opinions toward MPAs were more positive after volunteering with CCFRP. Those who had volunteered for seven or more years with CCFRP were more likely than not to gain a positive opinion of MPAs. Our survey results provide evidence that long-term engagement of stakeholders in collaborative research positively influences stakeholder opinions regarding marine resource management, and highlights CCFRP's success in engaging citizen science stakeholders in collaborative fisheries research.",2020,,PEERJ,8,,,WOS:000582667900001,10.7717/peerj.10146,,#19189,Mason 2020,,
Evaluating the potential of photo-identification as a monitoring tool for flapper skate (Dipturus intermedius),"Benjamins, S; Dodd, J; Thorburn, J; Milway, VA; Campbell, R; Bailey, DM","Flapper skates (Dipturus intermedius) were once widespread in European shelf waters but are currently classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to historical overexploitation. Novel monitoring approaches are needed to assess the efficacy of management measures, such as dedicated marine protected areas, for the conservation of relict skate populations. Flapper skates possess distinctive dorsal spot patterns, which could potentially be used for individual recognition using photo-identification (photo-ID) approaches. This study assessed the potential of photo-ID as a method for individual recognition of a relict population of skates within a dedicated marine protected area in western Scotland (UK), which has long been targeted by directed recreational angling. A collection of 486 photographs of 373 separate skate capture events from 2011 to 2016, taken with standard mobile phones and compact cameras, was studied using visual pairwise comparison methods to determine number of individuals and recapture rates. Results indicated that adult flapper skates were individually recognizable with a high degree of certainty through comparison of spot patterns, assuming appropriate lighting conditions. A total of 226 individuals were identified, of which 77 (34%) were recaptured at least once. The average recapture interval was 308 days (SE: 29.4 days), with the longest recapture interval to date being 4.4 years. Spot patterns among recaptured tagged or otherwise uniquely identifiable skates were found to remain stable over timescales of months to >1 year. Results indicate that photo-ID, based on photographs sourced through citizen science approaches, can provide a low-cost alternative means of monitoring flapper skate presence and distribution for the purposes of underpinning management decisions.",2018,,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,28,6,1360-1373,WOS:000453874900010,10.1002/aqc.2937,,#19193,Benjamins 2018,,
"Toward a sustainable Iceland scallop fishery in Gilbert Bay, a marine protected area in the eastern Canada coastal zone","Wroblewski, JS; Bell, TJ; Copeland, AI; Edinger, EN; Feng, CY; Saxby, JD; Schneider, DC; Simms, JM","Iceland scallop (Chlamys islandica) stocks in the North Atlantic are usually pulse harvested, resulting in boom and bust local landings. We describe an adaptive management strategy for a sustainable harvest of Iceland scallops in Gilbert Bay, a Marine Protected Area (MPA) of coastal Labrador. The current management plan for the MPA closes pristine scallop habitat, a practice that under favourable ocean conditions may lead to local reseeding. The community-based co-management structure for the MPA utilizes the local ecological knowledge of fishermen. Scallop harvesters are participating in research on the present state of the resource. Currently scallops are smaller near the mouth of the bay where fishing effort has been concentrated historically. The cooperation of fishers in enforcing area closures and in monitoring the scallop harvest may lead to a sustainable scallop fishery. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluating the management effectiveness of marine protected areas at seven selected sites in the Philippines,"Tupper, M; Asif, F; Garces, LR; Pido, MD","Fisheries is a vital sector in the Philippine economy, providing a significant source of both domestic and export earnings while meeting essential food security and nutritional requirements. However, marine resources in the Philippines are facing increasing pressure from overfishing, destructive fishing practices, habitat destruction, declining water quality and limited management capacity. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are part of the management strategy to address these issues but the majority of MPAs around the world do not meet their management objectives. This paper discusses the identification and testing of management effectiveness indicators to evaluate MPA management for seven sites in the Philippines. The selection of 14 indicators was a participatory process that involved representatives from the academe, civil society groups, fishing associations, local government units (LGUs), national government agencies and research institutions. Overall, the majority of the indicators are rated positive but there is significant room for improvement, particularly in areas of resource use conflict, availability and allocation of resources and interaction between MPA managers and stakeholders. It is imperative that MPAs across the Philippines be managed and implemented as a network to maximize conservation and fisheries management. Moreover, given that the Philippines lies in the Coral Triangle area of the highest marine biodiversity in the world, increased political will and support for MPAs is urgently needed to meet global marine biodiversity targets and allow the Philippines to be an example of effective marine biodiversity conservation.

Participatory socioeconomic analysis: drawing on fishermen's knowledge for marine protected area planning in California,"Scholz, A; Bonzon, K; Fujita, R; Benjamin, N; Woodling, N; Black, P; Steinback, C","The purpose of this pilot study was to test the utility of geospatial analysis tools for eliciting and integrating fishermen's(1) knowledge into marine protected area (MPA) planning processes in California, United States. A participatory design yielded 30 local knowledge interviews that were coded for socioeconomic and biodiversity information. The resulting information is useful in understanding past conflicts around MPA siting proposals and for identifying likely sources of agreement and disagreement. Products include a protocol for rapid socioeconomic assessment a database of fishermen's knowledge and information; and a geographic information system for further use in California's MPA planning process.

Citizen science helps assessing spatio-temporal distribution of sea turtles in foraging areas,"Casale, P; Ciccocioppo, A; Vagnoli, G; Rigoli, A; Freggi, D; Tolve, L; Luschi, P","Spatio-temporal distribution is fundamental information for species of conservation concern, like sea turtles, that are threatened by anthropogenic activities at sea such as fishing. While coarse-scale distribution information is available for several sea turtle populations, fine-scale distribution informing on hot-spot areas for spatial management is more difficult to obtain. Here a citizen science approach involving tourism boats was undertaken to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) in the Pelagie Archipelago, located in a major foraging area for this species in the Mediterranean and where high fishing-induced mortality occurs. The study was designed to provide data of absence and total sampling effort, commonly under-reported in citizen science studies, allowing comparison among zones and periods. This was complemented by reports from fishing vessels. Tourism boats reported 584 loggerhead turtle sightings during 1718 daily trips and fishing vessels reported 280 loggerhead turtles captured during 1040 fishing days. The results indicate a strong heterogeneous distribution in the Archipelago, with a low turtle occurrence around the main island, Lampedusa, where the highest human presence and activity occur. This may represent rare evidence of displacement behaviour of turtles that is worth further investigation. This also suggests that the current small marine protected area around Lampedusa has a low conservation impact. Zones with higher loggerhead turtle occurrence appear to be in the south and the west parts of the Archipelago, suggesting that spatial management would be possible when relatively small hot-spots have been identified through specific surveys. This study shows the potential of citizen science for providing preliminary information to guide more demanding and specific investigations. Such an approach may tremendously and rapidly improve the current knowledge on fine-scale sea turtle distribution in regions with a great extension of coastlines and intensive tourist activities, such as the Mediterranean.",2020,,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,30,1,123-130,WOS:000486182300001,10.1002/aqc.3228,,#19205,Casale 2020,,
Towards ecological and social impact through collaborative governance of a seascape of marine protected areas in Honduras,"Steadman, D","Protecting marine biodiversity and ensuring sustainable use through a seascape approach is becoming increasingly widespread in response to the ecological, social and institutional challenges of scaling ocean management. A seascape approach means clustering spatial management measures (marine protected areas) based around the principles of ecological connectivity, and developing or enhancing collaborative governance networks of relevant stakeholders (managers, community groups, non-governmental organizations) based around the principles of social connectivity. As with other large-scale approaches to marine management, there is minimal evidence of long-term impact in seascapes. This study uses a theory-based, participatory impact evaluation to assess perceived changes attributed to the Atlantida seascape in Honduras (initiated in 2015), encompassing three well-established marine protected areas and the non-legally managed waters between them. Using an adapted most significant change method, 15 interviews with a representative subset of seascape stakeholders yielded 165 stories of change, the majority (88%) of which were positive. Enhanced social capital, associated with cross-sectoral collaboration, inter-site conflict resolution and shared learning, was the most consistently expressed thematic change (32% of stories). Although most stories were expressed as activity- or output-related changes, a small proportion (18%) were causally linked to broader outcomes or impact around increased fish and flagship species abundance as well as interconnected well-being benefits for people. Although minimal (and occasionally attributed to prior initiatives that were enhanced by the seascape approach), this impact evidence tentatively links seascapes to recent related research around the effectiveness of appropriately scaled, ecosystem-based and collaboratively governed marine management that balances strict protection with sustainable use.",2021,,ORYX,55,4,507-518,WOS:000669896600017,10.1017/S0030605320001155,,#19207,Steadman 2021,,
Pink sea fans (Eunicella verrucosa) as indicators of the spatial efficacy of Marine Protected Areas in southwest UK coastal waters,"Pikesley, SK; Godley, BJ; Latham, H; Richardson, PB; Robson, LM; Solandt, JL; Trundle, C; Wood, C; Witt, MJ","Globally, the need to identify and establish integrated and connected systems of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is becoming increasingly recognised. For best practice, these networks need to be planned and assessed against multiple criteria. However, building a sound evidence base to support decision-making processes is complex, as well as fiscally and logistically challenging. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of integrating 'citizen science' data into mainstream scientific analysis, particularly where broad-scale spatial patterns of distribution are required. In UK waters, the pink sea fan (Eunicella verrucosa) is a nationally protected slow growing, cold-water coral, and is a representative species of reef features that provide habitat for many other sessile species. However, this species is vulnerable to physical impact and loss of suitable substratum, and is likely highly vulnerable to bottom-towed fishing gears. In this study, data from a volunteer-based marine survey programme ('Seasearch') are analysed with the aim of describing the spatial distribution and relative abundance of pink sea fan colonies throughout southwest UK coastal waters. The congruence between pink sea fans and the extant southern UK MPA network is reported, and the current threat from Bottom-Towed Gear (BTG) to pink sea fan dominated reefs, that have historically lacked protection, is quantitatively assessed. This analysis reveals that protection of this and other benthic species has been increased by management of previously 'open access' MPAs. Nonetheless, areas of pink sea fan habitat and their host reef systems exist outside extant protected areas in southwest UK seas, and as such are potentially at risk from bottom-towed fisheries. This analysis demonstrates the utility of well-organised citizen science data collection and highlights how such efforts can help inform knowledge on broad scale patterns of biodiversity.

"Resting Dynamics and Diel Activity of the Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas) in Rapa Nui, Chile","Petit, IJ; Gonzalez, CF; Gusmao, JB; Alvarez-Varas, R; Hinojosa, IA","Understanding animals' daily activity patterns such as foraging and resting is key to the effective conservation of individuals, populations, and species. Expanding habitat usage by humans today is likely one of the major factors influencing animal habitat use and behavior. Rapa Nui, a remote Chilean island located at the easternmost corner of the Polynesian Triangle, hosts a population of green turtles, Chelonia mydas, that have been monitored by citizen scientists since 2010. Through the collaborative work of divers from the local community and professional scientists, we describe C. mydas daily underwater resting and foraging patterns in Rapa Nui. We identified 15 individuals by monitoring 19 specific resting locations within the Rapa Nui coral reef. A high level of spatial fidelity for specific resting sites was observed in 12 turtles that used the same location for as long as 5 yrs. Moreover, we observed a clear temporal pattern in the daily use of resting habitats, with 79% of resting activity occurring during low tide. In contrast, the daily peak in feeding activity was associated with high tides. Abiotic characteristics (depth and cardinal orientation) of resting sites did not show significant relationships. The information from this study will inform management of the Rapa Nui Multiple Uses Coastal Marine Protected Area to increase the protection of marine turtles residing at this isolated Pacific Island.",2020,,CHELONIAN CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY,19,1,124-132,WOS:000552900600016,10.2744/CCB-1374.1,,#19214,Petit 2020,,
Community participation in assessment of fisheries related ecosystem services towards the establishment of marine protected area in the Greater Cape Three Points area in Ghana,"Sagoe, AA; Aheto, DW; Okyere, I; Adade, R; Odoi, J","Effective conservation management combines information obtained from formal scientific research with traditional knowledge derived from communities living within the ecosystem, in an integrated and comprehensive ecosystem assessment. To complement national efforts to establish Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in critical coastal ecosystems to protect nursery areas and spawning grounds in Ghana, two communities in the Greater Cape Three Points area in the Western Region of Ghana were involved in a participatory mapping and assessment exercise as part of an ecosystem-based approach to the establishment of MPAs in the area. The paper presents the processes by which the communities were engaged in identifying and mapping out top five priority ecosystem services (ES) vital for fisheries-an important livelihood source in the area-valuing the prioritized ecosystem services, and identifying and assessing four main anthropogenic pressures threatening the continual provisioning of ecosystem services. The relevance of such community participatory assessment in policy formulation is also discussed in the paper. The paper demonstrates that the livelihoods of rural coastal communities are linked to broader ecosystem functioning. It also shows that when participatory mapping is complemented with perspectives from direct beneficiaries of ES, managers are afforded a holistic insight into the array of issues that feed into a comprehensive management approach which addresses social, economic and ecological concerns.",2021,,MARINE POLICY,124,,,WOS:000609164100006,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104336,,#19223,Sagoe 2021,,
Collaborative Research: An Effective Way to Collect Data for Stock Assessments and Evaluate Marine Protected Areas in California,"Wendt, DE; Starr, RM","Collaborative fisheries research (in contrast to cooperative research) is based on the intellectual partnership between scientists and fishermen and is an effective way to collect data for stock assessments and to evaluate marine protected areas. Collaborative fisheries research is discussed in the context of co-management of marine resources and how it contributes to a more democratic form of fisheries management. Many benefits result from working together, including (1) the incorporation of fishers' knowledge and expertise into the management process and (2) the development of shared perspectives derived through science-based investigations on the status of marine resources. The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program was formed in 2006 to participate in the monitoring of marine reserves established through California's Marine Life Protection Act. This program has shown that it can serve as a model for other areas that are trying to implement collaborative research and that collaborative research can greatly contribute to the realization of community-based co-management of marine resources.",2009,,MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES,1,1,315-324,WOS:000208152800024,10.1577/C08-054.1,,#19225,Wendt 2009,,
Finding the right fit: Comparative cetacean distribution models using multiple data sources and statistical approaches,"Derville, S; Torres, LG; Iovan, C; Garrigue, C","Aim: Accurate predictions of cetacean distributions are essential to their conservation but are limited by statistical challenges and a paucity of data. This study aimed at comparing the capacity of various statistical algorithms to deal with biases commonly found in nonsystematic cetacean surveys and to evaluate the potential for citizen science data to improve habitat modelling and predictions. An endangered population of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in their breeding ground was used as a case study.Location: New Caledonia, Oceania.Methods: Five statistical algorithms were used to model the habitat preferences of humpback whales from 1,360 sightings collected over 14 years of nonsystematic research surveys. Three different background sampling approaches were tested when developing models from 625 crowdsourced sightings to assess methods accounting for citizen science spatial sampling bias. Model evaluation was conducted through cross-validation and prediction to an independent satellite tracking dataset.Results: Algorithms differed in complexity of the environmental relationships modelled, ecological interpretability and transferability. While parameter tuning had a great effect on model performances, GLMs generally had low predictive performance, SVMs were particularly hard to interpret, and BRTs had high descriptive power but showed signs of overfitting. MAXENT and especially GAMs provided a valuable complexity trade-off, accurate predictions and were ecologically intelligible. Models showed that humpback whales favoured cool (22-23 degrees C) and shallow waters (0-100 m deep) in coastal as well as offshore areas. Citizen science models converged with research survey models, specifically when accounting for spatial sampling bias.Main conclusions: Marine megafauna distribution models present specific challenges that may be addressed through integrative evaluation, independent testing and appropriately tuned statistical algorithms. Specifically, controlling overfitting is a priority when predicting cetacean distributions for large-scale conservation perspectives. Citizen science data appear to be a powerful tool to describe cetacean habitat.",2018,,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,24,11,1657-1673,WOS:000448070600012,10.1111/ddi.12782,,#19228,Derville 2018,,
Tracking Marine Alien Macroalgae in the Mediterranean Sea: The Contribution of Citizen Science and Remote Sensing,"Mannino, AM; Borfecchia, F; Micheli, C","The accelerating rate of the introduction of non-indigenous species (NIS) and the magnitude of shipping traffic make the Mediterranean Sea a hotspot of biological invasions. For the effective management of NIS, early detection and intensive monitoring over time and space are essential. Here, we present an overview of possible applications of citizen science and remote sensing in monitoring alien seaweeds in the Mediterranean Sea. Citizen science activities, involving the public (e.g., tourists, fishermen, divers) in the collection of data, have great potential for monitoring NIS. The innovative methodologies, based on remote sensing techniques coupled with in situ/laboratory advanced sampling/analysis methods for tracking such species, may be useful and effective tools for easily assessing NIS distribution patterns and monitoring the space/time changes in habitats in order to support the sustainable management of the ecosystems. The reported case studies highlight how these cost-effective systems can be useful complementary tools for monitoring NIS, especially in marine protected areas, which, despite their fundamental role in the conservation of marine biodiversity, are not immune to the introduction of NIS.

A perception-based participatory monitoring and evaluation approach to foster effective co-management of the marine protected areas in Northwest Africa,"Thiao, D; Wesdund, L; Sambe, B; Diadhiou, HD; Deme, M; Mbenga, A; Diop, M","In Northwest Africa, the last two decades were characterized by the establishment of many marine protected areas (MPAs) that are considered to be major fisheries management tools. This politically motivated trend - to use for fisheries management a tool initially conceived for biodiversity conservation - emerged in a context of increasing degradation of the marine and coastal ecosystems combined with a generalized overexploitation of the main fish stocks in the Sub-Region. However, the commitment to promote MPAs neglected the necessity to regularly and effectively monitor and evaluate their effectiveness. Therefore, in 2013-2014 the Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) project supported the development of an experimental participatory monitoring and evaluation (PM&E) approach for the Northwest African MPAs. This perception-based approach, which was implemented in two pilot MPAs in Senegal and Gambia, was then widely shared and discussed through several local meetings as well as in two regional and international workshops.

Underwater trail: A tool for an integrated management of marine protected areas in the Western Mediterranean Basin,"Abbad, K; Semroud, R; Andreu-Boussut, V; Bengoufa, S","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are considered as a cornerstone for the protection of the marine heritage and promotion of the integrated management approach. They are also areas conducive to the development of environmental education, scientific research and tourism activities. Underwater trails (UWTs) as ecotourism activities are very popular in MPAs, combining discovery and environmental education.The objective of this paper is to highlight and to provide a deeper understanding on how marine ecotourism activity may contribute to the implementation of an integrated management of an MPA by taking as a case study the implementation of UWTs in Taza National Park (TNP) in Algeria. For this purpose, the methodology concerns a mixed-method (qualitative and quantitative) based on interviews, survey and document analysis of the implementation process of the UWTs. The main results were grouped into five (5) themes: stakeholders' engagement, management model of the UWT, capacity building, UWT as a management tool and legal framework.The obtained results have validated the hypothesis that these UWTs could contribute to the good governance of the future MPA, in particular by delegating their management to diving clubs, contributing to local stakeholders' capacity building, and improving the communication between them. The evaluation of the participatory process, also, underlines the lack of effective stakeholder engagement and the importance of developing a strategy to assess their commitment throughout the process.

"Effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas in Managing the Drivers of Ecosystem Change: A Case of Mnazi Bay Marine Park, Tanzania","Machumu, ME; Yakupitiyage, A","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are being promoted in Tanzania to mitigate the drivers of ecosystem change such as overfishing and other anthropogenic impacts on marine resources. The effectiveness of MPAs in managing those drivers was assessed in three ecological zones, seafront, mangrove, and riverine of Mnazi Bay Marine Park, using Participatory Community Analysis techniques, questionnaire survey, checklist and fishery resource assessment methods. Eleven major drivers of ecosystem change were identified. Resource dependence had a major effect in all ecological zones of the park. The results indicated that the park's legislations/regulations, management procedures, and conservation efforts are reasonably effective in managing its resources. The positive signs accrued from conservation efforts have been realized by the communities in terms of increased catch/income, awareness and compliance. However, some natural and anthropogenic drivers continued to threaten the park's sustainability. Furthermore, implementation of resource use and benefit sharing mechanisms still remained a considerable challenge to be addressed.",2013,,AMBIO,42,3,369-380,WOS:000316740800009,10.1007/s13280-012-0352-8,,#19247,Machumu 2013,,
Many cameras make light work: opportunistic photographs of rare species in iNaturalist complement structured surveys of reef fish to better understand species richness,"Roberts, CJ; Verges, A; Callaghan, CT; Poore, AGB","Citizen science is on the rise, with growing numbers of initiatives, participants and increasing interest from the broader scientific community. iNaturalist is an example of a successful citizen science platform that enables users to opportunistically capture and share biodiversity observations. Understanding how data from such opportunistic citizen science platforms compare with and complement data from structured surveys will improve their use in future biodiversity research. We compared the opportunistic fish photographs from iNaturalist to those obtained from structured surveys at eight study reefs in Sydney, Australia over twelve years. iNaturalist recorded 1.2 to 5.5 times more fish species than structured surveys resulting in significantly greater annual species richness at half of the reefs, with the remainder showing no significant difference. iNaturalist likely recorded more species due to having simple methods, which allowed for broad participation with substantially more iNaturalist observation events (e.g., dives) than structured surveys over the same period. These results demonstrate the value of opportunistic citizen science platforms for documenting fish species richness, particularly where access and use of the marine environment is common and communities have the time and resources for expensive recreational activities (i.e., underwater photography). The datasets also recorded different species composition with iNaturalist recording many rare, less abundant, or cryptic species while the structured surveys captured many common and abundant species. These results suggest that integrating data from both opportunistic and structured data sources is likely to have the best outcome for future biodiversity monitoring and conservation activities.",,,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,,,,WOS:000772259200003,10.1007/s10531-022-02398-6,,#19249,,,
The Reef Check Mediterranean Underwater Coastal Environment Monitoring Protocol,"Turicchia, E; Ponti, M; Rossi, G; Milanese, M; Di Camillo, CG; Cerrano, C","Since 2001, trained snorkelers, freedivers, and scuba diver volunteers (collectively called EcoDivers) have been recording data on the distribution, abundance, and bathymetric range of 43 selected key marine species along the Mediterranean Sea coasts using the Reef Check Mediterranean Underwater Coastal Environment Monitoring (RCMed U-CEM) protocol. The taxa, including algae, invertebrates, and fishes, were selected by a combination of criteria, including ease of identification and being a key indicator of shifts in the Mediterranean subtidal habitats due to local pressures and climate change. The dataset collected using the RCMed U-CEM protocol is openly accessible across different platforms and allows for various uses. It has proven to be useful for several purposes, such as monitoring the ecological status of Mediterranean coastal environments, assessing the effects of human impacts and management interventions, as well as complementing scientific papers on species distribution and abundance, distribution modeling, and historical series. Also, the commitment of volunteers promotes marine stewardship and environmental awareness in marine conservation.

"Participation, Process Quality, and Performance of Marine Protected Areas in the Wider Caribbean","Dalton, T; Forrester, G; Pollnac, R","Throughout the wider Caribbean, marine protected areas (MPAs) are rapidly gaining momentum as a conservation tool, but management performance of existing MPAs is considered low. To enhance MPA management performance, stakeholders are increasingly being invited to discuss, debate, and develop rules about how people should interact with marine ecosystems. Using social and ecological data from a rapid assessment of 31 MPAs and their associated communities in the wider Caribbean, this study investigates stakeholder participation in MPA planning and management, and how participants' views of process quality relate to MPA performance. Findings indicate that (1) participants tended to be male, resource users, participate in community organizations, and have lived fewer years in the community associated with an MPA than non-participants; (2) simply participating was not associated with perceptions of the social and ecological performance of MPAs, however, perceptions of process quality were positively related to views of performance; and (3) resource users' perceptions of an MPA's ecological performance were likely shaped by a variety of factors. Conservation practitioners should be aware that participatory MPA processes are complex and require careful planning if they are to contribute positively to marine conservation efforts.",2012,,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,49,6,1224-1237,WOS:000304623200010,10.1007/s00267-012-9855-0,,#19257,Dalton 2012,,
Rethinking governance in a Brazilian multiple-use marine protected area,"Macedo, HS; Medeiros, RP","This paper comprises a systematic analysis of the governance of the Environmental Protected Area of Anhatomirim, a multiple-use coastal-marine protected area located in southern Brazil. The 2013 management plan brought major changes and improvements in the governance of the protected area, and today the provided incentives are more suited to the local reality, enhancing the stakeholders compliance and stewardship. The legal and the participative incentives are widely used, while the economic and the communicative incentives show an untapped potential. The interactions among the participative and the knowledge incentives, via the participatory monitoring programmes, are an innovative approach by Brazilian standards. On the other hand, the lack of inter-institutional and cross-scale connections is still the main weakness with regards to achieving conservation objectives and addressing current impacts, as most of the socioeconomic and ecological dynamics which must be addressed go beyond the protected area boundaries and its governance arrangements.",2021,,MARINE POLICY,127,,,WOS:000663338400002,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.08.019,,#19258,Macedo 2021,,
Using community-based monitoring with GIS to create habitat maps for a marine protected area in Australia,"Monk, J; Ierodiaconou, D; Bellgrove, A; Laurenson, L",In recent years there has been an increase in community-based monitoring programmes developed and implemented worldwide. This paper describes how the data collected from such a programme could be integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) to create temperate subtidal marine habitat maps. A differential Global Positioning System was utilized to accurately record the location of the trained community-based SCUBA diver data. These georeferenced data sets were then used to classify benthic habitats using an aerial photograph and digitizing techniques.

This paper describes the process involved, the chosen indicators and the selected results of the evaluation of management effectiveness of three MPAs in the Calamianes Islands, Palawan Province, Philippines. The evaluation was a participatory process that involved several institutions: academe, an externally-funded project, local governments, national government agencies and research organizations. Twenty-three indicators were used for evaluation: six biophysical indicators that largely measured the status of capture fisheries and coastal habitats; eight socioeconomic indicators that largely assessed the economic status and the perceptions of coastal communities; and nine governance indicators that measured the various facets of MPA management. Key lessons learned indicate the need to correlate the perceptions of coastal stakeholders with scientific findings as some perceptions did not reflect the results of biophysical surveys. We illustrate that a multidisciplinary approach and engagement of key stakeholders provides a comprehensive assessment and consensus for measuring the success of MPAs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the Central Visayas Region, Coastal Conservation and Education Foundation and Fisheries for Improved Sustainable Harvest are implementing socioecological networking initiatives. Educational programs, employing diverse methods such as cross visits and community MPA monitoring, are integral components of these projects. This article analyzes the relationship between education, information diffusion, and standard measures of MPA success (e.g., MPA rule compliance and fish abundance) in communities participating in these networks. Surveys were conducted with 13 individuals per community in 36 communities. Statistical tests reveal that the presence of a clear MPA leader, participation in cross visits, and presence of community environmental education programs were the strongest predictors of social and biological MPA success. Formal education programs (e.g., management committee member trainings) independent of other processes did not demonstrate strong statistical relationships with MPA success. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate the current and potential benefits and efficacy of education programs for communities in MPA networks. When linked to a strong infrastructure for information diffusion, education programs have the potential to increase both biological and social MPA success.",2009,,COASTAL MANAGEMENT,37,4-Mar,331-348,WOS:000265291800008,10.1080/08920750902851625,,#19277,Pietri 2009,,
"An open-source, citizen science and machine learning approach to analyse subsea movies","Anton, V; Germishuys, J; Bergstrom, P; Lindegarth, M; Obst, M","BackgroundThe increasing access to autonomously-operated technologies offer vast opportunities to sample large volumes of biological data. However, these technologies also impose novel demands on ecologists who need to apply tools for data management and processing that are efficient, publicly available and easy to use. Such tools are starting to be developed for a wider community and here we present an approach to combine essential analytical functions for analysing large volumes of image data in marine ecological research.New informationThis paper describes the Koster Seafloor Observatory, an open-source approach to analysing large amounts of subsea movie data for marine ecological research. The approach incorporates three distinct modules to: manage and archive the subsea movies, involve citizen scientists to accurately classify the footage and, finally, train and test machine learning algorithms for detection of biological objects. This modular approach is based on open-source code and allows researchers to customise and further develop the presented functionalities to various types of data and questions related to analysis of marine imagery. We tested our approach for monitoring cold water corals in a Marine Protected Area in Sweden using videos from remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs). Our study resulted in a machine learning model with an adequate performance, which was entirely trained with classifications provided by citizen scientists. We illustrate the application of machine learning models for automated inventories and monitoring of cold water corals. Our approach shows how citizen science can be used to effectively extract occurrence and abundance data for key ecological species and habitats from underwater footage. We conclude that the combination of open-source tools, citizen science systems, machine learning and high performance computational resources are key to successfully analyse large amounts of underwater imagery in the future.",2021,,BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL,9,,,WOS:000621550300001,10.3897/BDJ.9.e60548,,#19299,Anton 2021,,
Chasing fish and catching data: recreational spearfishing videos as a tool for assessing the structure of fish assemblages on shallow rocky reefs,"Bulleri, F; Benedetti-Cecchi, L","Several citizen science initiatives, taking advantage of growing numbers of re creational SCUBA divers, have produced information for conserving marine biodiversity. In contrast, the potential benefits of involving recreational spearfishers in research activities has been utterly overlooked. A noteworthy aspect of modern breath-holding spearfishing is the use of full HD microcameras for recording the fishing action. When using the sit and wait fishing technique, the spearfisher remains still on the bottom, waiting for the prey to approach. These videos may provide information on fish species richness and relative abundances. We explored the potential of recreational spearfishing footage for assessing the structure of fish assemblages on shallow rocky reefs. We assessed how estimates of fish species richness, composition and relative abundance from spearfishing videos compare to those from underwater visual censuses (UVC), at 2 sites in the NW Mediterranean. Species accumulation curves show that the 2 sampling methods provided comparable estimates of species richness for any sample size. Although the structure of fish assemblages differed between UVC and videos, the relative abundance of only a few species, mostly characterized by a sedentary habit, was greater in UVC than videos. In addition, in order to show the potential use of information from spearfishing videos, we modelled the occupancy of a species (the wrasse Symphodus rostratus) at increasing distances from a commercial port, explicitly incorporating imperfect detectability as a function of video length and habitat characteristics. While the occupancy of this species did not vary with distance from the port, its detectability depended on video length. Our study suggests that videos recorded by re creational spearfishers may be useful for monitoring fish assemblages and for testing hypotheses at large spatial and temporal scales.",2014,,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,506,,255-U569,WOS:000338120000017,10.3354/meps10804,,#19300,Bulleri 2014,,
Effects of climate-change-driven gradual and acute temperature changes on shark and ray species,"Osgood, GJ; White, ER; Baum, JK","Climate change is altering distributions and abundances of marine species through both gradual and acute changes in temperature and productivity. Due to their high mobility and metabolic rates, elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) are likely to redistribute across latitudes and depths as they thermoregulate, but little is known about their responses to these climatic changes, which could vary widely across this diverse group of species. Here, we assessed how species with differing mobility and ecology responded to gradual changes in daily sea surface temperature (SST) and acute temperature anomalies, caused by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), at Cocos Island, Costa Rica, the site of multiple marine heatwaves. We used generalized linear mixed models to analyse 34,342 records of relative abundance or frequency of occurrence for seven shark and ray species collected in 27 years (1993-2019) by a dive company. We compared effect sizes for SST and the Oceanic Nino Index across the different species, which vary widely in body size and mobility. Large, mobile species responded strongly but inconsistently to temperature. For scalloped hammerhead sharks Sphyrna lewini, a 1celcius rise in SST reduced counts by over 14%, and dropped the occurrence of their large schools by almost one-fifth (19.4%). Mobula ray occurrence also declined substantially with a few degrees rise in SST, whereas tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier occurrence sharply increased. These species also had divergent responses to the ENSO: S. lewini and G. cuvier were sighted with greater frequency during La Nina events, and their abundance dropped considerably during El Nino events-over a twofold decline between a strong La Nina and strong El Nino for S. lewini. In contrast, Mobula rays showed little response to ENSO. The smaller and sedentary Triaenodon obesus exhibited the weakest response of all species to both SST and the ENSO, reflecting its lower metabolic rates and mobility. Climate change will continue to impact elasmobranchs, even for smaller and more localized species, with the potential to impact the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs). Our results compel further work on the diversity of elasmobranch responses to environmental change.",2021,,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,90,11,2547-2559,WOS:000669881600001,10.1111/1365-2656.13560,,#19302,Osgood 2021,,
Free-diving underwater fish photography contests: a complementary tool for assessing littoral fish communities,"Gordoa, A; Boada, J; Garcia-Rubies, A; Sague, O","Characterizing fish communities must be a priority to safeguard resources and determine critical changes.

A total of 29 contests held from 2008 to 2015 at four different locations along the northeastern Spanish coast, including a marine protected area were analysed. Contests reward the number of species per participant and photographic quality. Species image frequency from each tournament were standardized to catch image rate. A total of 88 taxa were recorded, including 32 cryptobenthic species, the highest number recorded in the Mediterranean littoral system so far. Cluster analyses yielded four major groups. Catch image rates in the marine protected area were significantly higher for seven species of high commercial interest and for two big labrids of recreational interest, including an endangered species (Labrus viridis). Overall, the study showed that photographic free-diving contest data are a potential tool for determining species richness in littoral systems since contest rules promote competition between participants to obtain maximum fish diversity.

Political making of more-than-fishers through their involvement in ecological monitoring of protected areas,"Quintana, A; Basurto, X; Van Dyck, SR; Weaver, AH","One strategy for ecological monitoring of protected areas involves data collection by local resource users instead of external scientists. Growing support for such programs comes from their potential to both reduce costs and influence how resource users perceive and support protected areas, but their effects on participants are only beginning to be understood. We contribute to this growing research area through an in-depth study of how participants, their close kin, and their peers perceived the individual and community-wide effects of an ecological monitoring program. We examined the case of fishers' involvement in ecological monitoring of a marine protected area network in Baja California Sur, Mexico, organized since 2012 by the Mexican non-governmental organization Niparaja. Based on in-depth interviews and participant observation in 2016 and 2017, we found that the most salient effect of the program was personal growth. Participants described becoming ""more than a fisher"" through newly gained civic and environmental awareness, ecological knowledge, and self-confidence in public speaking skills. Respondents also identified health risks from diving and emotional burdens on participants' families. Overall, other resource users in their communities seem to be supportive through reputational benefits of participants. These effects overlap with but seem more extensive than those documented in other citizen science programs.

Suggestions for fixing top-down coastal fisheries management through participatory approaches,"Lopes, PFM; Rosa, EM; Salyvonchyk, S; Nora, V; Begossi, A","Marine protected areas created in a top-down way can be costly and ineffective due to low compliance of resource users. Conversely, employing users' local knowledge and involving them in decision-making processes could decrease costs and conflicts, in addition to increasing the chances of management success. Here the potential to change conflicting MPAs into conservation areas that take into account fishers' use and knowledge is assessed based on a case study on the Brazilian coast (Paraty town). Fishers (n=206) from 11 villages were interviewed regarding their main fishing targets and gear, and then only the experienced ones (n=41) were interviewed from three main fishing villages about the most important commercial species. Fish landings were sampled for one year in these three villages (n=823), where participatory mapping and group interviews with fishers were also conducted to determine their opinions regarding management and how they thought it should be undertaken. Management measures should not be equivalent across the whole region, as there were clear differences in the target species and gear used. Fishers identified 55 important fishing spots, eight of which were important for more than five villages, while the experts identified 10 important fishing areas for the target species, which was supported by the sampling of fish landings. The fishers were not opposed to management and no-take reserves but would make some changes in the current design of these measures if it were up to them. Based on these data, a few changes were indicated in the design of these areas that would likely reduce the conflict between fishers and enforcement agencies. This kind of approach could be used as a framework for adapting conflictive MPAs or to support the establishment of new ones where fisheries are relevant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the impact of MPAs on artisanal fishing communities is still poorly understood. In this research, we sought to understand the perceptions of artisanal fishers living around the Arvoredo Biological Reserve, a no-take MPA located in southern Brazil, and their relationship with the MPA. The fishing communities in this study are located in Tijucas Bay, an estuary located within the buffer zone of this MPA but outside its boundaries. Data collection was conducted using interviews and participatory mapping with artisanal fishers. The results show that fishers have detailed knowledge about different species, the bay, and the connections between the bay and the MPA. The fishers noted that the proper functioning of the MPA relies on avoiding industrial fishing in its borders and to limit trawling within the bay. Such measures are already in the MPA management plan, but lack of compliance is a perceived constraint. Data also show that local ecological knowledge is important to support the monitoring and evaluation of MPAs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Experiences With Governance in Three Marine Conservation Zoning Initiatives: Parameters for Assessment and Pathways Forward,"Muhl, EK; Dias, ACE; Armitage, D","In this perspective paper, we examine the challenges of governance in three marine conservation settings where rights, access to resources and zoning intersect with changing social and ecological conditions: (1) Tsitsikamma Marine Protected Area in South Africa; (2) Marine Protected Area of the Northern Coast of SAo Paulo (APAMLN) in Brazil; and (3) Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area Reserve in Canada. Many MPAs and related zoning initiatives are located adjacent to coastal communities that rely on marine and coastal resources for their livelihoods. Thus, processes of zoning must often address local use of natural resources which can be perceived by decision -makers and regulators as problematic.

Regular monitoring and targeted removals can control lionfish in Mediterranean Marine Protected Areas,"Kleitou, P; Rees, S; Cecconi, F; Kletou, D; Savva, I; Cai, LL; Hall-Spencer, JM","1. A lack of biosecurity in the Suez Canal has combined with global warming and other human pressures to cause abrupt changes in the Mediterranean Sea. Throughout this region an influx of species is influencing the outcome of efforts to protect and restore nature.2. Despite calls for targeted removals of invasive species from protected areas, there is limited information about the effectiveness of this course of action from both an ecological and a socio-economic perspective. In this study, coordinated removals of lionfish (Pterois miles) by volunteers/scuba divers at three marine protected sites in Cyprus were conducted.3. The removal efficiency was monitored using visual-census surveys and citizen science data. Removals significantly decreased lionfish numbers but long-term suppression of lionfish would require monitoring and repetition of removals when necessary, since population recovery was sometimes rapid.4. Citizen science yielded the data needed to understand lionfish population changes and guide the timing of removal events, but was characterized by large variation and potential outliers, highlighting the need for large sample sizes.5. Questionnaire surveys were used to assess the social impact of participation in lionfish removals; these showed that involvement had a strong positive impact on knowledge about lionfish and motivation to support marine conservation activities - the divers were even willing to pay extra to remove lionfish.6. Management reforms would be needed to capitalize on this societal motivation, and enable effective lionfish removals by scuba divers, coordinated by competent authorities. The EU aims to protect at least 30% of the marine waters by 2030. Removal events could help shield selected conservation sites from the adverse effects of lionfish and at the same time help establish links with local communities, strengthening the sustainable use of marine systems both at corporate and at societal levels.",2021,,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,31,10,2870-2882,WOS:000675256100001,10.1002/aqc.3669,,#19325,Kleitou 2021,,
"Age and growth of the Critically Endangered flapper skate, Dipturus intermedius","Regnier, T; Dodd, J; Benjamins, S; Gibb, FM; Wright, PJ","Knowledge of vital data such as growth and age at maturity is necessary to develop effective management strategies for endangered species. The Critically Endangered flapper skate (Dipturus intermedius) is the largest skate in the North Atlantic and growth information, necessary to assess key life-history traits, populations' growth rates and anticipate their response to management measures, is still lacking. While classical age estimation methods used in fish generally require the analysis of calcified structures, destructive methods are incompatible with conservation objectives for this species. Taking advantage of the high recreational value of the flapper skate, this study uses citizen-science data originating from photo-identification of trophy pictures and tag-recapture data supported by anglers to estimate growth in this Critically Endangered species. Using the growth increments measured between recapture events, an individual-based Von Bertalanffy growth model was fitted to the data using Bayesian inference. The results confirm that the flapper skate is a long-lived species with ages estimated as >40 years for the largest individuals captured. Despite this longevity, the model reveals a relatively fast initial growth but relatively late ages at maturity and significant sex-related differences in both growth rate and maximum size. These results suggest that population growth rate, and therefore recovery, might be much slower than previously reported. By using citizen science this study provides the necessary information to begin understanding population dynamics and monitor the recovery of an iconic Critically Endangered species.",2021,,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,31,9,2381-2388,WOS:000667841100001,10.1002/aqc.3654,,#19326,Regnier 2021,,
Improving marine protected area governance through collaboration and co-production,"Di Franco, A; Hogg, KE; Calo, A; Bennett, NJ; Sevin-Allouet, MA; Alaminos, OE; Lang, M; Koutsoubas, D; Prvan, M; Santarossa, L; Niccolini, F; Milazzo, M; Guidetti, P","Marine protected areas (MPAs) socio-ecological effectiveness depends on a number of management and governance elements, among which stakeholder engagement and community support play key roles. Collaborative conservation initiatives that engage stakeholders in action research and knowledge co-production processes can enhance management and governance of MPAs. To design effective strategies aimed at reconciling biodiversity conservation and management of sustainable human uses, it is key to assess how local communities respond to such initiatives and identify the set of contextual factors, institutional, local and individual, potentially affecting these responses. This paper presents the approach and results of one such initiative, spanning 6 EU countries and 11 MPAs in the Mediterranean Sea, focusing on small-scale fishers as key MPA users. Through a collaborative project, managers and fishers agreed upon specific governance interventions (e.g. increasing stakeholder engagement, engaging fishers in monitoring activities, reducing fishing efforts) to be implemented in each MPA for one year. Structured surveys queried: MPA managers on the MPA context, governance structure, feasibility and effectiveness of the tested interventions; and small-scale fishers on their perceptions of the impact of the tested interventions on a set of 9 socio-ecological variables (e.g. amount of fish caught, level of participation in decision-making, support for the MPA). Results revealed that the interventions tested were relatively feasible, effective and cost-effective. Fishers reported positive perceptions of the interventions for the 9 variables considered, especially for level of support for the MPA and for those associated with aspects of governance. Proportional odds models highlighted perceived effects are maximized under certain institutional, local and individual circumstances (e.g. old MPAs, small fisher communities, and fishers with a high proportion of income from fisheries). Findings highlight that employing good governance processes involving stakeholders may rapidly generate improved local support for conservation and provide insights for potential leverage points upon which to act to maximize perceived effectiveness and enhance support toward MPAs.",2020,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,269,,,WOS:000541757200035,10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110757,,#19328,DiFranco 2020,,
Underwater photo contests to complement coastal fish inventories: results from two Marine Protected Areas in the Mediterranean,"Tiralongo, F; La Mesa, G; De Mendoza, FP; Massari, F; Azzurro, E","Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are particularly useful to assess fish assemblages and to obtain reliable fish inventories. In this study we demonstrate the value of underwater photo contests as complementary tools to achieve these goals. We examined 3513 underwater pictures taken by free divers and scuba divers participating in two photo contests organized by the Italian Federation of Sport Fishing and Underwater Activities (FIPSAS). The competitions were held in the Italian MPAs of Punta Campanella (Tyrrhenian Sea; 2017) and Capo Rizzuto (Ionian Sea; 2018). Altogether, 97 fish species, 89 at Punta Campanella and 75 at Capo Rizzuto, were identified in different coastal habitats (depth range, 0-19 m). Their number was considerably higher than the one obtained with other census techniques and was close to the maximum number of species described at the two locations, as shown by accumulation curves. Significant differences in species richness were demonstrated at the level of both location and habitat type. The reasons for such differences are discussed along with the advantages and limitations of underwater photo contests as a participatory tool to obtain regular updates on coastal fish inventories in MPAs and in wider areas.",2021,,MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE,22,2,436-445,WOS:000683111100018,10.12681/mms.26176,,#19330,Tiralongo 2021,,
Utilizing Fishermen Knowledge and Expertise: Keys to Success for Collaborative Fisheries Research,"Yochum, N; Starr, RM; Wendt, DE","Collaborative fisheries research provides a mechanism for integrating the unique knowledge, experience, and skills of fishermen and scientists. It is a joint intellectual endeavor that begins with the inception of a project and continues until its final stages, with each group having mutual investment in-and ownership of-the project. Collaborative fisheries research promotes communication and trust among fishermen, scientists, and managers and can provide much-needed scientifically valid data for fisheries management. It can enhance federal and state management data collection programs, which span broad sections of coastline, by increasing the ability to detect changes in local metapopulations that may be over-fished or underutilized. We describe a methodology for conducting collaborative fisheries surveys and apply it to marine protected areas along the central California coast. During a series of workshops in 2006, attended by members of the fishing, academic, environmental, and management communities, protocols were established for conducting hook-and-line surveys collaboratively with commercial passenger fishing vessel captains and volunteer recreational anglers. The protocols have been implemented annually since 2007.

Cetacean Research and Citizen Science in Kenya,"Mwango'mbe, MG; Spilsbury, J; Trott, S; Nyunja, J; Wambiji, N; Collins, T; Gomes, I; Perez-Jorge, S","In 2011, several non-governmental and government agencies established the Kenya Marine Mammal Network (KMMN) to provide a platform for the consistent collection of data on marine mammals along the Kenyan coast, identify areas of importance and engage marine users and the general public in marine mammal conservation. Prior to the KMMN, relatively little was known about marine mammals in Kenya, limiting conservation strategies. The KMMN collects data nationwide through dedicated surveys, opportunistic sightings and participative citizen science, currently involving more than 100 contributors. This paper reviews data on sightings and strandings for small cetaceans in Kenya collated by the KMMN. From 2011 to 2019, 792 records of 11 species of small cetaceans were documented. The most frequently reported inshore species were the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin and Indian Ocean humpback dolphin. Offshore species, included killer whales, short-finned pilot whale and long-snouted spinner dolphin. Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, long-snouted spinner dolphins, striped dolphins and Risso's dolphins were recorded through stranding reports. The efforts of the KMMN were disseminated through international meetings (International Whaling Commission, World Marine Mammal Conference), national status reports, outreach and social media. Data has also supported the identification of three IUCN Important Marine Mammal Areas and one Area of Interest in Kenya. Further research is needed to improve estimates of cetacean abundance and distribution, particularly in unstudied coastal areas, and to assess the extent of anthropogenic threats associated with fisheries, coastal and port development, seismic exercises and unregulated tourism. The expansion of the network should benefit from the participation of remote coastal fishing communities, government research agencies, tourism and seismic operations, among others. The KMMN demonstrated the value of dedicated and citizen science data to enhance marine mammal conservation strategies to boost awareness and eco-tourism and to bring the public and science closer together, promoting research and effective conservation efforts.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000664161100001,10.3389/fmars.2021.642399,,#19337,Mwango'mbe 2021,,
Identifying spatial conservation priorities using Traditional and Local Ecological Knowledge of iconic marine species and ecosystem threats,"Noble, MM; Harasti, D; Fulton, CJ; Doran, B","Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can be an effective spatial approach to conservation, especially when they involve genuine consultation that considers the diversity of stakeholders. Participatory mapping and semi structured interviews were conducted with 52 stakeholders and 22 managers and scientists to identify ecological priorities and concerns across a large temperate MPA in Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park, Australia. There were 19 iconic species of fish, dolphins, whales, and sea turtles that were the focus of ecological priorities and stakeholder interactions with the marine environment. Effectiveness of the current MPA management plan for addressing stakeholder priority and concerns, was assessed using GIS spatial modelling that created fuzzy-set species distribution models (SDMs) based on Traditional and Local Ecological Knowledge as well as scientific and citizen-science survey data. These spatial models for the iconic species across the MPA were then overlaid with ecological concerns of the stakeholders to create a spatial understanding of local threats, and priority areas for targeted management. Poor water quality from terrestrial primary sources was the main concern of stakeholders, more so than in-water threats such as poor fishing practices or impacts to iconic species. While local managers and scientists were relatively reluctant to answer interview questions, there was a general misalignment in approaches to iconic species management, especially for mobile and migratory species, and misunderstanding of stakeholder perceptions of threats. Participatory mapping of social-ecological values provides a method for stakeholders and decision-makers to better understand, discuss, and adapt marine spatial management approaches that support a diversity of conservation and management priorities.",2020,,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,249,,,WOS:000567872700004,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108709,,#19340,Noble 2020,,
"Regional Assessment of the Conservation Status of Snubfin Dolphins (Orcaella heinsohni) in the Kimberley Region, Western Australia","Bouchet, PJ; Thiele, D; Marley, SA; Waples, K; Weisenberger, F; Rangers, B; Rangers, BJ; Rangers, D; Rangers, NBY; Rangers, NN; Rangers, U; Raudino, H","Implementing conservation measures for data-limited species is a fundamental challenge for wildlife managers and policy-makers, and proves difficult for cryptic marine animals occurring in naturally low numbers across remote seascapes. There is currently scant information on the abundance and habitat preferences of Australian snubfin dolphins (Orcaella heinsohni) throughout much of their geographical range, and especially within the Kimberley region of northern Western Australia. Such knowledge gaps curtail rigorous threat assessments on both local and regional scales. To address this and assist future conservation listings, we built the first comprehensive catalog of snubfin dolphin sightings for the Kimberley. We used these data to estimate the species' extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) along the region's 7,000 km coastline, following a simple Bootstrap bivariate kernel approach to combine datasets of varying quality and quantify uncertainty. Our catalog consists of 1,597 visual detections of snubfin dolphins made over a period of 17 years (2004-2020) and collated from multiple sources, including online biodiversity repositories, peer-reviewed scientific articles, citizen science programs, as well as dedicated marine wildlife surveys with local Indigenous communities and Ranger groups. Snubfin dolphins were consistently encountered in shallow waters (<21 m depth) close to (<15 km) freshwater inputs, with high detection rates in known hotspots (e.g., Roebuck Bay, Cygnet Bay) as well as in coastal habitats suspected to be suitable (e.g., Prince Regent River and surrounds, King Sound, Doubtful Bay, Napier Broome Bay and the upper Cambridge Gulf). Bootstrap estimates of EOO and AOO were 38,300 (95% CI: 25,451-42,437) km(2) and 700 (656-736) km(2) respectively, suggesting that snubfin dolphins in the Kimberley are likely Vulnerable under IUCN criteria B2 at a regional scale, in keeping with their global classification.

"Community-based management fails to halt declines of bumphead parrotfish and humphead wrasse in Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands","Hamilton, RJ; Hughes, A; Brown, CJ; Leve, T; Kama, W","Community-based fisheries management that integrates local knowledge and existing user rights is often seen as a solution to the failures of top-down fisheries management in the Pacific. In Roviana Lagoon, Western Solomon Islands, a network of community-based marine protected areas (MPAs) was established in the early 2000s to conserve declining populations of bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum) and other locally valuable fish species such as humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus). We aimed to evaluate the success of these protected areas at preventing declines of B. muricatum and C. undulatus. We conducted 27 underwater visual census (UVC) surveys at permanent passage and outer reef monitoring sites in Roviana Lagoon in 2018 and compared our findings with results from 72 UVC surveys that we had conducted at the same sites 18yrs earlier. We also interviewed Roviana spearfishers about their maximum nightly B. muricatum catches from 2018, the early 2000s and the 1980s. Abundances of all B. muricatum and C. undulatus sighted on UVC surveys declined by 62% and 57%, respectively, between 2000 and 2018, and abundances of adult B. muricatum and C. undulatus declined by 78% and 72%, respectively, over the same period. Using a joint model of B. muricatum abundance and its reported maximum catch, we estimated that in 2018 the population of B. muricatum was 8% of its 1980's abundance. By modelling projected rates of decline over three generations, we show that populations of B. muricatum and C. undulatus in Roviana Lagoon meet the IUCN Red List thresholds for Critically Endangered (CR). The probable causes of these declines are sustained fishing pressure, poor enforcement of community-based management measures and loss of fish nursery habitats due to logging. Our findings suggest urgent co-management of the ridge-to-reef system is needed to prevent further fish population declines in Roviana Lagoon.",2019,,CORAL REEFS,38,3,455-465,WOS:000469356900007,10.1007/s00338-019-01801-z,,#19364,Hamilton 2019,,
"Fishing in the dark-local knowledge, night spearfishing and spawning aggregations in the Western Solomon Islands","Hamilton, RJ; Giningele, M; Aswani, S; Ecochard, JL","Within the marine conservation community there is considerable interest in combining local knowledge and science to achieve management objectives. Yet there remain few studies which have examined the merits and caveats of local knowledge, or shown how combining both knowledge systems has resulted in better management outcomes. This study outlines collaborative efforts to conserve fish spawning aggregations (FSAs) in Roviana Lagoon, Western Solomon Islands. Baseline information on FSAs was obtained through local knowledge and spearfishing creel surveys. This information provided the starting point for establishing a 2-year community-based underwater monitoring program at the largest known FSA in Roviana Lagoon, where the brown-marbled grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus), camouflage grouper (Epinephelus polyphekadion) and squaretail coralgrouper (Plectropomus areolatus) co-aggregate. This participatory research shows that local knowledge on FSAs is utilised to maximise returns from fishing, with spearfishermen targeting aggregations at night during the lunar periods when abundances peak. Because of its shallow distribution P. areolatus is the most vulnerable of the three groupers to nighttime spearfishing, with two fishermen capable of removing 15-30% of the total spawning biomass in two nights. Underwater monitoring demonstrates that while fishermen provided accurate information on many aspects of FSAs, their knowledge on spawning seasons was inaccurate for the FSA reported on here. Peak aggregations occurred from December to April each year, which differs from the traditionally recognised grouper season of October to January. A combination of local knowledge and science was used to develop appropriate management measures for this FSA, with the aggregation declared a community-based marine protected area (MPA) in 2006.

Local ecological knowledge and the management of marine protected areas in Brazil,"Gerhardinger, LC; Godoy, EAS; Jones, PJS","This manuscript discusses the role of fishers' Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) in the management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Brazil. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken at nine MPAs to investigate MPA managers' (n=9) and higher governmental level authorities' (n=5) perceptions on these. Varying levels of MPA governance approaches were assessed, from government-led centralized top-down (e.g. marine biological reserves) to community-based bottom-up MPA categories (e.g. marine extractive reserves). The use of fishers' LEK was found to be an essential means of achieving a broader and more diverse knowledge basis for MPA management, though most of the management current in place is still science-driven in Brazil. The full engagement of local knowledge can also be regarded as a means of empowering local communities and promoting responsibility, but only if a more inclusive praxis of participation is put to work. Different meanings for 'Local Knowledge Use' in MPA management were outlined and described for different management approaches (top-down vs. bottom-up). It was noted that each of these meanings brings different outcomes in terms of stakeholder participation and empowerment. It is also suggested that MPA co-management schemes might benefit from the adoption of a 'knowledge-building' instead of 'knowledge-using' approach during a 'problem-solving' instead of 'decision-making' management process. Finally, it is concluded that it will be an enormous challenge to put LEK to work in the benefit of MPAs in the country amidst so many priority actions brought by the problems affecting the Brazilian National System of MPAs. Government must open up the agenda to deliberatively discuss the roles of local knowledge in MPA management, whilst local communities organise themselves and increase the demand for participation with responsibility.

"Spatiotemporal Trends Observed in 20 Years of Posidonia oceanica Monitoring along the Alicante Coast, Spain","Blanco-Murillo, F; Jimenez-Gutierrez, S; Martinez-Vidal, J; Guillen, JE; Sanchez-Lizaso, JL","Posidonia oceanica meadows, known to be valuable marine ecosystems, have been reported to be in decline as a result of human activities in recent decades. However, it is still controversial if this decline is a global phenomenon or it is caused by specific disturbances related to human development at a local scale. In order to evaluate changes in P. oceanica meadows, in this study, monitoring data obtained at 14 stations along the Mediterranean coast near Alicante, Spain, over a 20-year period were analyzed. Field data were obtained through the citizen science project POSIMED, which had the aim of carrying out annual monitoring of both shallow and deep P. oceanica meadows along the coast near Alicante and determining whether their ecological status was changing over time. The percentage cover of living P. oceanica and dead matte and shoot density data were used to assess the ecosystem status and to determine whether there had been an overall regional decline in seagrass over the 20-year period. Both cover and density data showed a significant positive trend at most locations. However, the amount of dead matte was noted to slightly increase with time while six shallow and one deep station showed a negative P. oceanica cover trend, indicating that in certain locations meadow regression might be taking place. Shoot density decreased with depth and increased with the amount of rock cover; its correlation with the dead matte percentage was unclear, which probably means that a range of different factors can result in the presence of dead plants. These results support the idea that local disturbances are the cause of seagrass decline in the Mediterranean, thus demonstrating the need for management plans that focus on local stressors of P. oceanica meadows at specific locations. Long-term, large-scale monitoring allows the ecosystem status in the western Mediterranean to be assessed; however, local disturbances can also affect specific locations.",2022,,WATER,14,3,,WOS:000754630700001,10.3390/w14030274,,#19373,Blanco-Murillo 2022,,
Engaging 'the crowd' in remote sensing to learn about habitat affinity of the Weddell seal in Antarctica,"LaRue, MA; Ainley, DG; Pennycook, J; Stamatiou, K; Salas, L; Nur, N; Stammerjohn, S; Barrington, L","Satellites Over Seals (SOS), a project initiated in late 2016, is a crowdsourced method to determine factors behind the presence/absence patterns and to ultimately determine the global population of the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii). An iconic species, the Weddell seal is proposed to be part of the Antarctic Research and Monitoring Program required in the newly designated Ross Sea Region Marine Protected Area. This species is easy to detect via satellite imagery, due to its large size (3-4 m long, 1 m wide) and its dark color contrasting with the Antarctic coastal fast ice, where it aggregates on during breeding season. Using very high-resolution satellite imagery (VHR; 0.31-0.60 m resolution) and the online platform Tomnod, we used VHR images from November 2010 and 2011 to cover the entirety of available fast ice around Antarctica. Before correcting for time of day or date, we searched for the presence/absence to identify a subset of where abundance estimates should be concentrated. More than 325 000 citizen scientists searched 790 VHR images, covering 268 611 km(2) of fast ice, to determine the locations of seals. Algorithms ranked searchers to the degree their votes corresponded with others, a measure of searcher relative quality that we used to filter out unreliable searchers. Seal presence was detected on only 0.55% of available maps (total n = 1 116 058) within fast ice, revealing a sparse, irregular distribution. The rate of false-negative detections was 1.7%, though false positives were high (67%), highlighting the importance of training for image interpretation to ensure differentiation between seals and landscape features (such as large rocks, ice chunks or depressions/holes in the ice). This approach not only allowed us to assess image resolution and quality, but also training, outreach and the effectiveness of this platform for introducing citizen scientists to the ecology of the Southern Ocean.",2020,,REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,6,1,70-78,WOS:000519756100005,10.1002/rse2.124,,#19377,LaRue 2020,,
Stakeholder analysis for marine conservation planning using public participation GIS,"Brown, G; Strickland-Munro, J; Kobryn, H; Moore, SA","Stakeholders are presumed to represent different interests for marine and coastal areas with the potential to influence marine protected area planning and management. We implemented a public participation GIS (PPGIS) system in the remote Kimberley region of Australia to identify the spatial values and preferences for marine and coastal areas. We assessed similarities and differences in PPGIS participants (N = 578) using three operational definitions for ""stakeholder"" based on: (1) self-identified group, (2) self-identified future interests in the region, and (3) participant value orientation that reflects a preferred trade-off between environmental and economic outcomes. We found moderate levels of association between alternative stakeholder classifications that were logically related to general and place specific participatory mapping behavior in the study region. We then analyzed how stakeholder classifications influence specific management preferences for proposed marine protected areas (MPAs) in the study region. Conservation-related values and preferences dominated the mapped results in all proposed marine reserves, the likely result of volunteer sampling bias by conservation stakeholder interests participating in the study. However, we suggest these results may also reflect the highly politicized process of marine conservation planning in the Kimberley where conservation efforts have recently emerged and galvanized to oppose a major offshore gas development and associated land-based infrastructure. Consistent with other participatory mapping studies, our results indicate that the chosen operational definition for stakeholder group such as group identity versus interests can influence participatory mapping outcomes, with implications for MPA designation and management. Future research is needed to better understand the strengths and limitations of participatory mapping that is framed in stakeholder perspectives, especially when sampling relies heavily on volunteer recruitment and participation methods that appear predisposed to participatory bias. In parallel, practical efforts to ensure that social research efforts such as this are included in MPA planning must remain of the highest priority for scientists and managers alike.

Assessing ecological changes in and around marine reserves using community perceptions and biological surveys,"Yasue, M; Kaufman, L; Vincent, ACJ","1. Well-enforced partial or total no-fishing zones (collectively known as marine protected areas, or MPAs) can help restore degraded coral reefs and enhance fish populations.2. A comparison was made of community perceptions of ecological changes in an MPA with concurrent scientific data on these changes in the same MPA. Such analyses are particularly important in community-based MPAs where local support is a key determinant of ecological success.3. The no-take MPA in question was initially launched in partnership with the community in 1995 and formalized in 1998. The perceptions data come from interviews with community members in 1999 and 2004, the biological data come from underwater visual censuses of the MPA from 1998 to 2004.4. Community members perceived more fish within the MPA and slight increases in catch outside the MPA. In contrast, fish censuses showed a high degree of stochastic variation and only minor increases in fish abundance, size and diversity in and around the MPA between 1998 and 2004.5. Possible explanations for these discrepancies include different temporal, spatial or species frames of reference and/or limitations to the biological survey technique. Other options include wishful thinking, external influences, a desire to please, or confounding with other benefits.6. This study demonstrates some of the strengths and weaknesses of community perceptions and biological data. In order to improve our understanding about the changes that occur over time in an MPA and engender community support for the long-term viability of MPAs, it is important to develop diverse and efficient monitoring schemes.

"Exclusionary decision-making processes in marine governance: The rezoning plan for the protected areas of the 'iconic' Galapagos Islands, Ecuador","Burbano, DV; Meredith, TC; Mulrennan, ME","The number of marine protected areas (MPAs) has increased twenty-fold since 1993, and there are ambitious targets for further expansion set by international conservation agencies. This expansion has been accompanied by claims that only No-take MPAs (NTMPAs) can effectively ensure biodiversity conservation, and the international marine conservation community has become increasingly active and influential in promoting them. However, NTMPAs clearly have consequences for resource users whose livelihoods are impacted by restricted access to natural resources. Since these consequences can trigger social conflicts that impeded progress towards conservation goals, there have been concerted efforts to find collaborative and inclusive approaches to MPA planning and management. This paper assesses stakeholder engagement in decision-making processes related to marine conservation planning and management in the Galapagos Marine Reserve, and examines how these have been influenced by shifting narratives of biodiversity conservation in the lead up to, and the execution of, the 2016 rezoning process. A dramatic shift in the rezoning process, a top-down declaration of a no-take MPA, fostered social conflicts that have delayed the full-implementation of the new zoning plan even three years after its official declaration. Through a mixed-methods approach we contrast perceptions, expectations and experiences of key actors in three stakeholder groups: the small-scale fisheries sector, the scientific research community, and the conservation management sector. This study illustrates challenges associated with rushed conservation initiatives, promoted and supported by large external conservation NGOs, and it demonstrates how a ""back to the barriers"" approach to conservation can undermine acceptance of conservation practices and jeopardize the success of MPAs.",2020,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,185,,,WOS:000510533000022,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.105066,,#19396,Burbano 2020,,
Combining Natural History Collections with Fisher Knowledge for Community-Based Conservation in Fiji,"Golden, AS; Naisilsisili, W; Ligairi, I; Drew, JA","Harnessing the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of local communities has the potential to enhance conservation planning in developing regions. Marine protected areas (MPAs) that incorporate traditional beliefs about reef tenure are generally more successful in reaching conservation goals and ensuring the participation of local fishermen on vulnerable tropical reef systems. Fiji possesses a unique system of traditional reef management in which local clans or villages, called mataqali, control individual units of a reef, known as qoliqoli, and make independent management decisions based on traditional beliefs and conservation concerns. This is an example of a system, known as customary marine tenure, which has attracted interest from conservation scientists hoping to set up MPAs in vulnerable regions. As one example of this grassroots participation, Nagigi village on the Fijian island of Vanua Levu has expressed interest in setting up an MPA in part of its qoliqoli because of concerns about overfishing. In response to this interest, we took a two-pronged approach to assessing Nagigi's fishery status and conservation needs, first conducting a fishery-independent species survey using destructive sampling and then focusing on fisheries targets identified through fisher interviews. These interviews allowed us to identify heavily targeted species, assess villagers' understanding of reef dynamics over 30 or 40 years of fisheries expansion, and evaluate village support and expectations for a proposed conservation program. Based on our findings we recommend a temporary closure to be in effect for at least three years, allowing one of the more important fishery targets, Lethrinus harak (Forsskal, 1775; Lethrinidae), to complete at least one generation within the reserve. The methodology of matching the proposed marine protected area with the life histories and ecologies of heavily targeted species identified through fisherman and -woman interviews can offer a template for future conservation projects that seek to synthesize indigenous peoples' needs and knowledge with ecological data.",2014,,PLOS ONE,9,5,,WOS:000336730600079,10.1371/journal.pone.0098036,,#19397,Golden 2014,,
MedSens index: The bridge between marine citizen science and coastal management,"Turicchia, E; Cerrano, C; Ghetta, M; Abbiati, M; Ponti, M","Citizen science (CS) projects may provide community-based ecosystem monitoring, expanding our ability to collect data across space and time. However, the data from CS are often not effectively integrated into institutional monitoring programs and decision-making processes, especially in marine conservation. This limitation is partially due to difficulties in accessing the data and the lack of tools and indices for proper management at intended spatial and temporal scales. MedSens is a biotic index specifically developed to provide information on the environmental status of subtidal rocky coastal habitats, filling a gap between marine CS and coastal management in the Mediterranean Sea. The MedSens index is based on 25 selected species, incorporating their sensitivities to the pressures indicated by the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) and open data on their distributions and abundances, collected by trained volunteers (scuba divers, free divers and snorkelers) using the Reef Check Mediterranean Underwater Coastal Environment Monitoring (RCMed UCEM) protocol. The species sensitivities were assessed relative to their resistance and resilience against physical, chemical, and biological pressures, according to benchmark levels and a literature review. The MedSens index was calibrated on a dataset of 33,021 observations from 569 volunteers (2001-2019), along six countries' coasts. A free and user-friendly QGIS plugin allows easy index calculation for areas and time frames of interest. The MedSens index was applied to Mediterranean marine protected areas (MPAs) and the management and monitoring zones within Italian MPAs. In the studied cases, the MedSens index responds well to the local pressures documented by previous investigations.MedSens converts the data collected by trained volunteers into an effective monitoring tool for the Mediterranean subtidal rocky coastal habitats. MedSens can help conservationists and decision-makers identify the main pressures acting in these habitats, as required by the MSFD, supporting them in the implementation of appropriate marine biodiversity conservation measures and better communicate the results of their actions. By directly involving stakeholders, this approach increases public awareness and the acceptability of management decisions, enabling more participatory conservation tactics.",2021,,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,122,,,WOS:000613233900010,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107296,,#19402,Turicchia 2021,,
Community involvement in management for maintaining coral reef resilience and biodiversity in southern Caribbean marine protected areas,"Camargo, C; Maldonado, JH; Alvarado, E; Moreno-Sanchez, R; Mendoza, S; Manrique, N; Mogollon, A; Osorio, JD; Grajales, A; Sanchez, JA","Climate change is posing new challenges to conservation because management policies on protected coral reefs are less effective than they were before the current ecosystem degradation. Coral reefs, the most diverse and complex marine ecosystem provide economic services for millions, but are seriously threatened worldwide because reef-building corals are experiencing bleaching phenomena and a steady decline in abundance. The resources of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Cartagena, Colombia, are in constant decline, despite a current management plan and on-site staff, urging new conservation actions. A multidisciplinary team gathered to evaluate management effectiveness including biophysical, socioeconomic and governance indicators. Coral cover and fish diversity and abundance were low both inside and outside the MPA, which suggests a limited efficiency of management. Currently, the MPA is a reef with low coral cover and high algae cover as well as large dead coral areas, which are generally signs of highly degraded reef habitats. Live coral cover in the MPA was represented by pioneer coral species such as Agaricia tenuifolia and Porites astreoides. Nonetheless, 35% of the scleractinian species sampled in the area harbored more than one zooxanthellae symbiont, which suggests potential resistance and resilience against coral bleaching. Maintenance of trophic structure and functional diversity is an important endeavor that should be a priority for management in order to allow ecosystem resilience. Social and governance indicators showed low-income levels and few opportunities for communities living in and around the park, low governability, weak communication among stakeholders and with authorities at different levels. As a result, problems related to over exploitation of resources were commonplace in the MPA. These results reflect low adaptive capacity of communities to comply with restrictive conservation rules, showing that establishment of a protected area is a necessary but insufficient condition to guarantee conservation goals. Ignoring the role of local communities only will exacerbate the problems associated with natural resources. Involvement of communities in strategic ecosystems management appears to be a requisite to improve effectiveness of protected areas, and participatory strategies, such as co-management, offer opportunities to improve governability while letting communities adapt to MPA needs.",2009,,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,18,4,935-956,WOS:000264546400011,10.1007/s10531-008-9555-5,,#19404,Camargo 2009,,
Integrating marine biodiversity through Philippine local development plans,"Raquino, ME; Pajaro, M; Watts, P","Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to highlight how data from marine protected area (MPA) surveys can be used to facilitate the development of systematic approaches to monitoring biodiversity within local government development plans and across marine bioregions.Design/methodology/approach-The study focussed on coastal Barangays of the Municipality of San Luis, Aurora Philippines. A Participatory Coastal Resource Assessment (PCRA) was conducted to gather information on corals and reef fishery resources. Resultant Simpson's biodiversity indices were calculated and compared to other MPA sites. Linkages to enhanced marine curriculum in a San Luis high school were evaluated by utilizing cultural consensus theory (CCT) on previously reported local student perception surveys as a further effort on defining pathways for localized transformation.Findings-San Luis MPA biodiversity indices ranged from 0.56-0.8 on a scale of 0-1. This initial analysis demonstrates how local monitoring can be connected to resource assessment through biodiversity considerations and in developing local plans for site improvement linked to local economies. Results are used to demonstrate the potential for further development of an integrated approach to biodiversity monitoring across and between bioregions as a step forward in strengthening science for MPAs and biodiversity conservation for the Philippines.Practical implications-The study could be used to pilot study strengthening of coastal resource management (CRM) at Municipal and Barangay levels and as well through application of CCT to the topics. The results will be used to reinforce the formulation of San Luis local development plans to better consider marine resource assessment.Originality/value-This paper provides a new perspective on the use of quantitative measures of biodiversity to assist with local development plans.

A nationwide assessment of litter on China's beaches using citizen science data,"Chen, HZ; Wang, SM; Guo, HG; Lin, H; Zhang, YB","China is the largest plastic consumer in the world. Despite its plastic waste import ban in 2017, this populous economy inevitably generates a large amount of waste, including plastic waste, a considerable part of which has become marine litter. Data from the 2018 National Coastal Cleanup and Monitoring Project, the largest beach litter monitoring activities using the citizen science approach in China, have been retrieved and analyzed to understand spatial patterns, composition, and original usage of marine litter. Within this project, 24 beaches were surveyed every two months. As a result, the mean density was 3.85 +/- 5.39 items m(-2), much higher than that reported by previous studies in China. There were great differences in the spatial distribution of litter. The highest densities appeared in the runoff-affected area of the Yangtze River, which was another difference from previous studies. Low-density, easy-to-transport foamed plastics were the major contributor to marine litter in these areas. Along China's coast, approximately 90% of litter was from land-based sources, and over half of that originated from domestic sources. Including foamed plastic products, plastic litter with low recycling value dominated. Both natural and human factors influencing the spatiotemporal distribution and composition of litter are discussed. Socioeconomic factors, such as the lifestyle and consumption levels of citizens and local waste management systems, are possible explanations for the low-value characteristic of marine litter. The deviation between previous data and citizen science data in this study may be caused by many factors. Based on the discussion on these factors, some suggestions for citizen science research in China are also put forward. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Shifting elasmobranch community assemblage at Cocos Islandan isolated marine protected area,"White, ER; Myers, MC; Flemming, JM; Baum, JK","Fishing pressure has increased the extinction risk of many elasmobranch (shark and ray) species. Although many countries have established no-take marine reserves, a paucity of monitoring data means it is still unclear if reserves are effectively protecting these species. We examined data collected by a small group of divers over the past 21 years at one of the world's oldest marine protected areas (MPAs), Cocos Island National Park, Costa Rica. We used mixed effects models to determine trends in relative abundance, or probability of occurrence, of 12 monitored elasmobranch species while accounting for variation among observers and from abiotic factors. Eight of 12 species declined significantly over the past 2 decades. We documented decreases in relative abundance for 6 species, including the iconic scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) (-45%), whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus) (-77%), mobula ray (Mobula spp.) (-78%), and manta ray (Manta birostris) (-89%), and decreases in the probability of occurrence for 2 other species. Several of these species have small home ranges and should be better protected by an MPA, which underscores the notion that declines of marine megafauna will continue unabated in MPAs unless there is adequate enforcement effort to control fishing. In addition, probability of occurrence at Cocos Island of tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier), Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), and whale (Rhincodon typus) sharks increased significantly. The effectiveness of MPAs cannot be evaluated by examining single species because population responses can vary depending on life history traits and vulnerability to fishing pressure.Modificacion del Ensamble de Comunidades de Elasmobranquios en la Isla de Cocos, un area Marina Protegida Aislada La presion de la pesca ha incrementado el riesgo de extincion de muchas especies de elasmobranquios (tiburones y rayas). Aunque muchos paises han establecido areas de no-pesca, una escasez de datos de monitoreo implica que todavia no esta claro si estas reservas estan protegiendo efectivamente a estas especies. Examinamos datos colectados por un pequeno grupo de buzos a lo largo de los ultimos 21 anos en una de las areas marinas protegidas (AMP) mas vieja del mundo: Parque Nacional Isla de Cocos, Costa Rica. Usamos modelos de efectos mixtos para determinar tendencias en la abundancia relativa, o probabilidad de caso, de doce especies monitoreadas de elasmobranquios compensando la variacion entre observadores y de factores abioticos. Ocho de las doce especies declinaron significativamente a lo largo de las ultimas dos decadas.

Muchas de estas especies tienen extensiones de habitat pequenas y deberian estar mejor protegidas por una AMP, lo que enfatiza la nocion de que las declinaciones de megafauna marina continuaran sin cesar en las AMP a menos de que exista un esfuerzo adecuado de control de pesca. Ademas de esto, la probabilidad de ocurrencia en la Isla de Cocos de de los tiburones tigre (Galeocerdo cuvier), de las Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis), de punta negra (Carcharhinus limbatus) y ballena (Rhincodon typus) incremento significativamente.

"Using citizen science and survey data to determine the recruitment envelope of the giant clam, Tridacna gigas (Cardiidae: Tridacninae)","Requilme, JNC; Conaco, C; Sayco, SLG; Roa-Quiaoit, HA; Cabaitan, PC","Restocking of giant clams, particularly Tridacna gigas, aims to reestablish breeding populations that have long been decimated by overexploitation. In Camiguin, southern Philippines, T. gigas juveniles that were restocked in 2001 have reached reproductive maturity and recruits have been observed on the reefs. To help document T. gigas recruits in Camiguin, the Cantaan Centennial Multi-purpose Cooperative (CCMPC) initiated a program to encourage local fishers to report any sightings of giant clams, in the surrounding reefs. The fishers would mark the location of any giant clam recruits they encountered during their regular fishing trips using makeshift buoys. Personnel from CCMP would then visit the marked sites to collect GPS data. The giant clams would later be relocated to an ocean-based nursery at the CCMP marine protected area (MPA) to ensure their protection. A total of 26 T. gigas recruits with a mean shell length of 17.8 +/- 1.5 cm were found 0.2 km-2.3 km away from the restocking site between 2015 and 2017. Twenty-three of these individuals were reported by fishers while 3 were encountered during field surveys. It is highly probable that these T. gigas recruits are the progeny of the restocked individuals because there are no local populations of wild T. gigas in the area and no artificial spawning events had been conducted at the site. These results suggest that the reefs near Camiguin are suitable for giant clam recruitment and indicate that the recruitment envelope of T. gigas can extend up to several kilometers. Importantly, these findings highlight the value of a strong commitment by local organizations and collaboration with fishers as citizen scientists to enhance the sustainability of giant clam conservation efforts.",2021,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,202,,,WOS:000626147200011,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105515,,#19416,Requilme 2021,,
Global evaluation of shark sanctuaries,"Ward-Paige, CA; Worm, B","Due to well-documented declines in many shark populations there is increasing pressure to implement new management and rebuilding strategies at the national and international scale. Since 2009, fifteen coastal countries in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans have opted to ban commercial shark fishing altogether, and have laws that prohibit the possession, trade or sale of sharks and shark products. These 'shark sanctuaries' collectively cover > 3% of the world's oceans, a similar coverage as all currently established marine protected areas combined. Despite their prominence, and an intense scientific debate about their usefulness, the condition of shark sanctuaries has not yet been empirically evaluated. Here, we report results from a global diver survey used to set baselines of shark populations, human use patterns, public awareness and threats in all 15 shark sanctuaries, and contrasted with observations from 23 non-sanctuary countries. Specific results varied by country, but there were some general trends: i) shark sanctuaries showed less pronounced shark population declines, fewer observations of sharks being sold on markets, and lower overall fishing threats compared to non shark sanctuaries, ii) bycatch, ghost gear, marine debris and habitat destruction are significant threats that are often not addressed by sanctuary regulations and need to be resolved in other ways, and iii) participants in sanctuaries were more optimistic about the survival of shark populations in local waters, but also highlighted the need for further conservation efforts. These results suggest that shark sanctuaries, as seen through the lens of local experts, may be a helpful conservation tool but likely not sufficient in isolation. There is an urgent need for higher-resolution data on shark abundance, incidental catch, and markets to direct priority conservation needs and optimize the conservation benefits of existing and future shark sanctuaries.",2017,,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,47,,174-189,WOS:000418392300017,10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2017.09.005,,#19419,Ward-Paige 2017,,
Traditional Ecological Knowledge and the mapping of benthic marine habitats,"Teixeira, JB; Martins, AS; Pinheiro, HT; Secchin, NA; de Moura, RL; Bastos, AC","Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) is the empirically accumulated knowledge of local communities whose livelihoods depend directly on natural resources. TEK has a considerable potential as a reliable, rapid and low cost information source. However, its use for decision making in environmental management is frequently challenged due to the lack of scientific validation and the multiple and poorly understood biases deriving from measurement and analytical errors, as well as from political, cultural and religious sources. During the planning stage of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Southeastern Brazil we assessed fisherfolk TEK regarding seabed features, comparing it with results from a conventional oceanographic assessment. TEK was acquired and synthesized during a survey involving 19 fishing villages and a consensus analysis that minimized variation among individual fisherfolks and communities. The oceanographic survey included high resolution benthic habitat mapping tools such as sidescan sonar and ground-truthing with SCUBA near the interfaces of benthic features identified by fisherfolk. Nearly 3000 km(2) of seafloor were mapped by local fisherfolk as ""gravel"", ""sand"", ""mud"" and ""reef structures"", while side-scan sonar surveys covered approximately 360 km with an average 400 m swath. Analyses of overlap and proximity showed that TEK is relatively cost-effective and accurate for large-scale benthic surveys, especially as a starting point for planning oceanographic surveys. Moreover, including TEK in the planning stage of MPAs may increase communities' participation and understanding of the costs and benefits of the new access and fishing effort regulations.

The results show that most fishers and managers agreed on the need to include seagrasses specifically in future management. There was further agreement on dragnets being the most destructive gears, and the use of dragnets being a major threat to local seagrass ecosystems. Gear restrictions excluding illegal dragnets were the favored management measure among fishers. Differences between fishers and managers were found concerning seaweed farming, eutrophication and erosion being potential threats to seagrass meadows. A majority of the interviewed fishers were willing to participate in monitoring and controls, and most fishers thought that they themselves and their communities would benefit the most from establishing seagrass management.

Managing Marine Protected Areas in Remote Areas: The Case of the Subantarctic Heard and McDonald Islands,"Brooks, CM; Epstein, G; Ban, NC","Large marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being established to contribute to global conservation targets but present an immense challenge for managers as they seek to govern human interactions with the environment over a vast geographical expanse. These challenges are further compounded by the remote location of some MPAs, which magnify the costs of management activities. However, large size and remoteness alone may be insufficient to achieve conservation outcomes in the absence of critical management functions such as environmental monitoring and enforcement. The Australian subantarctic Heard Island and McDonald Islands (HIMI) Marine Reserve is among the world's most remote MPAs with notoriously harsh oceanographic conditions, and yet the region's rich mammal and fish resources have been exploited intermittently since the mid-1800s. More recently, the development of lucrative international markets for Patagonian toothfish, sold as Chilean seabass, led to the growth in both legal and illegal fishing. In 2002, to conserve the unique ecology and biodiversity in the area, Australia declared a 65,000 km2 MPA around HIMI. Worldwide, government agencies have, however, struggled to develop cost-effective institutional arrangements for conservation. This paper therefore draws upon the social-ecological systems meta-analysis database (SESMAD) to characterize the structure of conservation governance and outcomes in the HIMI Marine Reserve. The Marine Reserve has generally been successful in supporting a sustainable fishery while addressing threats to biodiversity. The remote and isolated nature of the Marine Reserve was critical to its success, but also benefited greatly from collaborations between managers and the fishing industry. Commercial fishers keep watch over the Reserve while fishing, report any observations of illegal fishing (none since 2006/07), and have at times been asked to verify remote observation of potential illegal fishing vessels. The industry also undertakes annual ecological surveys in the MPA, allowing managers to track environmental trends. The fishing industry itself highlights the importance of industry participation in conservation planning, strengthened by secure access to resources via statutory fishing rights, which provide critical incentives to invest in conservation. We therefore reflect on the potential application of this case to other remote large MPAs, highlighting potential directions for future research.",2019,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,6,,,WOS:000490150000001,10.3389/fmars.2019.00631,,#19446,Brooks 2019,,
How effective are marine parks in protecting their coral reef ecosystem? A study case in the Mexican Caribbean,"Diaz-Osorio, AC; Schmitter-Soto, JJ; Vega-Zepeda, A; Espinoza-Tenorio, A","In the Mexican Caribbean, marine protected areas have been established to tackle marine ecosystem degradation caused by the coastal development that started in Cancun in the 1970s and extended south to the border with Belize in the 1990s. It is crucial to assess their effectiveness for conservation of the reef ecosystem, but also the perception of stakeholders, because the objective would be unattainable without their participation. This study evaluated the conservation status and the management effectiveness of National Park Xcalak Reefs (PNAX), in the southernmost Mexican Caribbean. In addition to interviewing local stakeholders to recognize issues related to the administration and functioning of PNAX, four zones with different use restrictions inside the park were evaluated, using ecological indicators (diversity and abundance of fishes, coral diversity and cover, and macroalgal cover) and ecological knowledge by interviewing local stakeholders, mostly fishers and conservation personnel. The results suggest that one of the restricted-use zones is in good condition, with a higher abundance of fishes and coral cover, and a lower cover of fleshy macroalgae and turf, compared with the other zones in the protected area. On the other hand, the core area presents bad indicators, such as a higher macroalgal cover and lower abundance of fishes, suggesting poor management or insufficient enforcement. Although mistrust and lack of communication between fishers and conservation authorities may limit the achievement of conservation goals, some programmes involving active participation of local people, for example lionfish culling and coastal vegetation restoration, have had a good impact on the coral reef community.",,,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,,,,WOS:000782296900001,10.1002/aqc.3820,,#19454,,,

Using underwater visual census (UVC) and photo-identification (photo-ID) techniques, we estimated the abundance, residency and site fidelity of the dusky grouper, Epinephelus marginatus, at two protected sites within the Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Protected Area (Sardinia, Italy) in the summers of 2017-2018. The scope and spatio-temporal resolution of the study was extended by involving volunteer recreational divers in the photo collection. Grouper mean densities varied significantly across sampling dates, with a significant variability between the 2 years and the two investigated sites. At least 94 grouper visited the study sites in the summers of 2017-2018 based on the analysis of 968 high-quality photos using a semi-automated software to photo-identify individuals. Overall, the most frequently sighted grouper was recorded on 32 different days and 21 individuals (22%) identified in 2017 were re-sighted in 2018. The participation of volunteer recreational divers helped detect the inter-site (3.5-4 km apart) movements of a female and a male, supporting previous findings regarding the occurrence of reproduction-related movements. This study provides novel insights into the residency and site-fidelity patterns of the dusky grouper, and its small-scale movements probably related to reproduction.

Community-based monitoring detects catastrophic earthquake and tsunami impacts on seagrass beds in the Solomon Islands,"Moseby, KE; Daniels, A; Duri, V; Tropa, W; Welma, S; Bero, A; Soapi, K","Tetepare Island in the Solomon Islands is the largest uninhabited island in the South Pacific and supports seagrass beds inside fringing reefs along its coastline.

Both seagrass cover and diversity declined after the tsunami and had not reached pre-Tsunami levels after 8 years. Seagrass cover declined the fastest at sites on Rendova, closest to the epicentre, declining from 50% to < 10% cover within 12 months of the earthquake. At sites within the Tetepare MPA, seagrass cover took longer to decline and dropped from an average of 50% to < 10% within 2 years and became dominated by Halophila ovalis. Species richness declined from 9 to 4 species with some species such as Syringodium isoetifolium disappearing from monitoring sites.

Engaging Recreational Fishers in Management and Conservation: Global Case Studies,"Granek, EF; Madin, EMP; Brown, MA; Figueira, W; Cameron, DS; Hogan, Z; Kristianson, G; De Villiers, P; Williaims, JE; Post, J; Zahn, S; Arlinghaus, R","Globally, The number of recreational fishers is sizeable and increasing in many countries. Associated with this trend is the potential for negative impacts on fish stocks through exploitation or management measures such as stocking and introduction of non-native fishes. Nevertheless, recreational fishers call be instrumental in successful fisheries conservation through active involvement in, or initiation of, conservation projects to reduce both direct and external stressors contributing to fishery declines. Understanding fishers' concerns for sustained access to the resource and developing methods for their meaningful participation can have positive impacts on conservation efforts. We examined a suite of case studies that demonstrate successful involvement of recreational fishers in conservation and management activities that span developed and developing countries, temperate and tropical regions, marine and freshwater systems, and open- and closed access fisheries. To illustrate potential benefits and challenges of involving recreational fishers in fisheries management and conservation, we examined the socioeconomic and ecological contexts of each case study. We devised a conceptual framework for the engagement of recreational fishers that targets particular types of involvement (enforcement, advocacy, conservation, management design [type and location], research, and monitoring) on the basis of degree of stakeholder stewardship, scale of the fishery, and source of impacts (Internal or external). These activities can be enhanced by incorporating local knowledge and traditions, taking advantage of leadership and regional networks, and creating collaborations among various stakeholder groups, scientists, and agencies to maximize the probability of recreational fisher involvement and project success.",2008,,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,22,5,1125-1134,WOS:000260252000008,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00977.x,,#19487,Granek 2008,,REVIEW ARTICLE
Science-based coastal management in Fiji: Two case studies from the NGO sector,"Hastings, JG; Gruby, RL; Sievanen, LS","The effectiveness of coastal management in developing countries is widely perceived to be inhibited by a lack of scientific data on the coastal zone. To try to fill this need for information, donors and big international non-governmental organizations are increasingly initiating large-scale, science-driven conservation programs, with the goal of creating and using management relevant transdisciplinary datasets. In Oceania, these programs are entering a context where local ecological knowledge is already informing existing community-based approaches to coastal management. This paper examines two large-scale programs in Fiji, the Marine Management Area Science initiative and the Vatu-i-Ra and Cakau Levu Reefs Seascape Project, and offers insight relevant to the planning and implementation of similar programs where local management systems are already in place. Research methods used to examine the programs included document analysis, direct observation, and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders over multiple field visits to Fiji in 2009 and 2010. Results suggest that as donors, non-governmental organizations, and partners move forward in implementing these programs, there must be active steps taken to bridge boundaries between disciplines and among knowledge systems, evaluate the added value of science for all stakeholder groups, and build opportunities for datasets to be used after donor funding ends.

Expanding the role of participatory mapping to assess ecosystem service provision in local coastal environments,"Burdon, D; Potts, T; McKinley, E; Lew, S; Shilland, R; Gormley, K; Thomson, S; Forster, R","There has been increasing international effort to better understand the diversity and quality of marine natural capital, ecosystem services and their associated societal benefits. However, there is an evidence gap as to how these benefits are identified at the local scale, where benefits are provided and to whom, trade-offs in development decisions, and understanding how benefits support well-being. Often the benefits of conservation are poorly understood at the local scale, are not effectively integrated into policy and are rarely included meaningfully in public discourse. This paper addresses this disjuncture and responds to the demand for improving dialogue with local communities and stakeholders. Participatory GIS mapping is used as a direct means of co-producing knowledge with stakeholder and community interests. This paper drives a shift from development of participatory approaches to adaptive applications in real-world case studies of local, national and international policy relevance. The results from four sites along the UK North Sea coast are presented. This paper showcases a robust stakeholder-driven approach that can be used to inform marine planning, conservation management and coastal development.

Fishers as advocates of marine protected areas: a case study from Galicia (NW Spain),"de Oliveira, LP","After years of facing problems such as overfishing, illegal fisheries and the consequences of the Prestige oil spill, the fishermen's association (cofradia) of Lira, a small town in the coast of Galicia (NW Spain), has pioneered a co-management initiative in the region by proposing the creation of a marine reserve. The proposal was designed and developed by the fishers in partnership with biologists and social scientists, environmentalists and members of the autonomous government of Galicia in a highly participatory process. The views of different stakeholders on the implementation process for the marine reserve were assessed through a programme of semi-structured interviews. These findings were also used to analyse issues related to the implementation process employing a governance analysis framework. It was observed that the inclusion of fishers in the decision-making and the use of their traditional ecological knowledge in the design of the reserve promoted a better understanding of its benefits and an improved compliance with the fishing regulations. The effectiveness of the marine reserve was very high during the first years but it has been recently undermined due to the reduction of financial state support for enforcement in the light of the current economic recession. Whilst this marine reserve was driven by the stakeholders, the prospects depend on an adequate state enforcement capacity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Stakeholders perceptions of local environmental changes as a tool for impact assessment in coastal zones,"Mani-Peres, C; Xavier, LY; Santos, CR; Turra, A","Through history, population growth and anthropic activities have pressed and affected marine environments, causing impacts that were not always studied or reported. In this context, evaluate stakeholders perceptions of a particular region in Coastal Zones (CZs) can be useful for identifying environmental impacts that occurred in the past, especially in the absence of preterit data and effective monitoring. Engaging stakeholders in the discussion of local transformations may also contribute to the development of shared local management strategies regarding the knowledge and opinions of stakeholders about the place they live in. Thus, considering Araca Bay as a case of study, this research aimed to understand preterit and present transformations on the Bay, through the perception of the people who live and visit the region for a long period of time. Data collected with interviews enabled the identification of events and factors that have induced changes in the region, mainly related to large enterprises and buildings that occurred from the second half of the twentieth century. Major impacts perceived by interviewees were changes in spatial configuration of the Bay, changes in hydrodynamic and sedimentary patterns, reduction of coastal vegetation areas and increased pollution. Some of these changes were also pointed by scientific studies or observed in historic aerial photographs, and were no totally predicted by EIA of related enterprise. Considering the importance of communities' perception and its use to better understand historical facts, preterit and present impacts derived from local human interventions, it is concluded that they are an important qualitative database and can be useful for the development of management strategies and for EIA analysis.

Despite extensive conservation and restoration effort, evidence of successful population recovery is rare. In this work, we document mass mortality events of pink and green abalone (Haliotis corrugata and Haliotis fulgens) in 2009-2010, and their subsequent rapid recovery following the continued enforcement and monitoring of two voluntary no-take reserves by the local fishing cooperative (2006-present) and a 6-year fishing closure (2012-2017) around Isla Natividad, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Age data collected from harvested abalone in 2019 suggest recruitment was maintained throughout the years when abundance was lowest following mass mortalities. The observed 6 to 8-year time frame for recovery is consistent with scenarios presented in previous modeling studies, where marine reserves and other measures aimed at protecting large spawners predicted the potential for rapid recovery of abalone populations. This case study supports the effectiveness of a portfolio of resilience strategies, which include combining climate refugia and marine reserves, adherence to conservative annual fishing quotas, fishing closures, minimum size limitations, and ecological monitoring. Importantly, this example showcases how close collaboration between fishers, resource managers, scientists, and non-governmental organization (NGOs) is critical for designing, implementing, and learning from conservation and management interventions to reverse marine population and ecosystem decline, reinforcing the legacy of Dr. Pete Peterson's life work on fully integrating ecology with marine management and restoration.",2022,,ECOSPHERE,13,3,,WOS:000776290300021,10.1002/ecs2.4002,,#19514,Smith 2022,,
"Using local user perceptions to evaluate outcomes of protected area management in the Sagay Marine Reserve, Philippines","Webb, EL; Maliao, RJ; Siar, SV","Local user perceptions of resource trajectory and indicators of protected area outcomes can be useful in the assessment of integrated conservation projects, both marine and terrestrial. In-depth stakeholder surveys using 12 performance indicators were used to evaluate the perceived outcomes of the Sagay Marine Reserve (SMR), the Philippines. These indicators were a measure of whether the SMR had achieved its management objectives in the recent past and what local stakeholders expected in the future. The respondents' contextual situation could be correlated with their perceptions of SMR indicators. There was a generally high level of perceived equity and efficiency of SMR management outcomes, but the sustainability of the SMR, particularly the condition of the fisheries, had been poor over the previous 10 years. Few anticipated an improvement in sustainability indicators over the next 10 years. Respondents from an island village within the SMR had more negative (or less positive) perceptions of SMR outcomes because of their high dependence on the degraded resource, combined with physical and economic isolation. Specific remedies to enhance island villagers, satisfaction, such as greater participation, empowerment, alternative economic opportunities and fisheries protection, and replenishment, are necessary. This research serves as an example of how indicators perceived by local resource-accessing stakeholders can and should be main components of both marine and terrestrial protected area assessment.",2004,,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,31,2,138-148,WOS:000223385000006,10.1017/S0376892904001377,,#19521,Webb 2004,,

This study outlines collaborative efforts with Mayan lobster diver-fishers, who participated voluntarily as citizen scientists in surveys, to detect and monitor the invasive red lionfish, Pterois volitans, in a marine protected area off the northern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We engaged these fishers by building local capacity and awareness of the threats of the lionfish invasion on the fishery resources of the area. During the lobster fishing season (July 2010-February 2011), 30 fishers collected 248 red lionfish (9-29 cm TL) and recorded ancillary data (day, month, depth, and approximate coordinates of capture site). This collaboration not only allowed the first lionfish detection in the Parque Nacional Arrecife Alacranes in 2010, but the volunteer-based monitoring effort revealed that the invasion reached levels from intermediate to advanced, with more than 200 specimens captured in less than a year.

"THE RECOVERY OF A TROPICAL MARINE MOLLUSK FISHERY: A TRANSDISCIPLINARY COMMUNITY-BASED APPROACH IN NAVAKAVU, FIJI","Thaman, B; Thaman, RR; Balawa, A; Veitayaki, J","This paper presents findings from a species-by-species assessment of the collapse and recovery of a tropical mollusk fishery in Navakavu, Fiji. The results are based on field surveys, photo documentation, collection of voucher specimens, participant observation, and testimonies of past and current generations of female and male fishers. The results show the degradation of fisheries resources at almost all trophic levels over the past 40 years due to overfishing, destructive fishing techniques, and environmental degradation, as well as the positive impacts of the establishment of a locally managed marine area (LMMA) and associated marine protected area (MPA), known locally as ""Vueti Navakavu.'' Since its establishment in 2002, nearly 300 mollusk species, including gastropods, bivalves, and cephalopods, are either being seen for the first time in over 40 years or are clearly increasing in abundance and/ or size class. There has been a particularly dramatic increase in the abundance of a wide range of cone shells (Conus spp.), cowries (Cypraea spp.), conches (Strombidae), murexes (Muricidae), auger shells (Terebridae), and turban snails (Turbanidae), as well as octopus, squid, and seahare, all of which are of economic, cultural, and ecological importance. The results show that sustained effective marine conservation can, in general, lead to the recovery of seriously degraded fisheries and, in particular, of tropical mollusk fauna.

Use of community perceptions to evaluate and adapt coastal resource management practices in the Philippines,"Mudge, L","Coastal resource management (CRM) programs have been implemented in the Philippines since the 1980s with the specific intent to protect and rehabilitate coastal habitats and enhance the sustainability of coastal communities. However, the implementation of these programs alone does not guarantee the success of program objectives. Monitoring and evaluation of program outcomes is essential for determining if programs are effective in reaching management goals. The purpose of this research was to evaluate long-term CRM programs using community perceptions of coastal resource condition, management practices, and program outcomes. Coastal residents in Baybay City, Leyte were surveyed and asked to rank a series of questions related to resource condition and 20 previously described management performance indicators. Respondents reported a decline in coastal resource condition over the past decade, even though they perceive positive outcomes of management programs aimed at enhancing resource condition. The sustainability and efficiency of management outcomes were perceived positively, with mixed views on equity outcomes. Results suggest that lack of full inclusion, low management oversight, and threat to coastal resources are concerns of the coastal community. Socioeconomic data collected from respondents, yielded a pattern indicating that gender, self-reported level of environmental knowledge, and management cluster were significant contextual variables associated with perceptions of respondents. Overall, CRM programs are perceived to have a positive impact and there is a high level of interest for participating in future management activities.

The research was conducted in the context of licensing decisions for offshore wind farms in the North Sea (Scotland, UK).A set of linked, modular participatory processes were developed to foster cross-sector stakeholder engagement. It employed an exchange of ecological, legal, social, economic and cultural knowledge around marine ecosystem services. Workshop exercises included participatory mapping, benefit identification, and developing an understanding of linkages between ecosystem services, benefits, stakeholders' activities and policy drivers through co-development of conceptual systems maps of the study area.The participatory exercises fostered meaningful dialogue across sectors and an ability to participate equally, despite initial differences in knowledge about ecosystem services. The development of conceptual systems maps facilitated productive discussion about trade-offs in relation to different policies. Reflective discussion identifies ways in which the developed processes could be integrated into future decision making.An assessment of the approach revealed that it operationalised a post normal science framework in terms of process oversight, multiple knowledge claims, and managing uncertainty. It developed a process that linked understanding of ecosystem functioning with the creation and implementation of policy thereby creating an ecosystem approach to marine spatial planning and licensing decisions, as required by law.This approach has extensive transferability to situations where stakeholder engagement is required to develop policy and provide feedback as part of a decision-making process.

Combining Knowledge Systems Helps Understand the Spatial Dynamics of Data-Limited Small-Scale Fisheries Systems in Brazil: A Methods Analysis,"Borges, R; Eyzaguirre, IAL; Barboza, RSL; Boos, K; Glaser, M; Lopes, PFM","Mangrove habitats provide nursery, shelter, and feeding sites for many economically relevant fish, and invertebrates, such as crabs. Given the highly artisanal character and the patchy spatial distribution of small-scale fishing in mangroves, there is often little data available to inform management, potentially threatening the sustainability of this livelihood-supporting activity. This study assesses the combination of different data collection methods and of including published data in the analysis of the spatial dynamics. We examine crab fisheries in two sustainable-use protected areas as a case study to understand use patterns as indicated by a specific combination of mapping methods. Mangrove crab fishing grounds were mapped by overlaying crab gatherers' tracked routes with maps produced during participatory-mapping-centered interviews. Information from the literature was used to spatialize crab carapace width and relate it to distance traveled by fishers. Results show that crabs tended to be larger if caught farther from the villages where fishers live. In terms of collection methods, even though GPS tracking is relatively time- and resource-consuming, incorporating some GPS tracking into participatory mapping helps overcome a downside of this type of mapping (e.g., lack of geographical precision) and identifies information that can be accessed through participatory techniques.

"Risk-based approaches to deal with uncertainty in a data-poor system: Stakeholder involvement in hazard identification for marine national parks and marine sanctuaries in Victoria, Australia","Carey, JM; Beilin, R; Boxshall, A; Burgman, MA; Flander, L","Management responsibilities for the system of marine national parks and sanctuaries declared in Victoria, Australia in 2002 have created imperatives for robust, scientifically defendable approaches to identifying threats to valued ecological attributes of the parks, setting management priorities, and developing monitoring systems. We are developing a protocol for ecological risk assessment in the parks that has due regard for the perception of risks by individuals, and ensures that stakeholder values are an intrinsic part of decision making. The inclusive and transparent protocol provides an opportunity for stakeholder involvement in the identification of valued attributes, as well as in the assessment of associated risks. Our approach brings together ideas about how science enters the community engagement domain in ways that promote collaboration and transparency in decision making. A series of stakeholder workshops across the state drew on the expertise of agency staff, community groups, fishers, industry representatives, academics, and knowledgeable park neighbors to identify hazards of major concern in the parks. Many hazards involved predictable, tangible threats like pollution and exotic species, but the approach also identified a number of less obvious threats related to governance issues and the knowledge-base for the parks. Importantly, the workshops with their broad range of stakeholders identified threats not previously considered by the management agency in its internal assessments, and several of these ""new"" threats are already the subject of action by the agency. The deliberate incorporation of local knowledge and local networks in the risk assessment process also provided opportunities for greater engagement of stakeholders with the management agency.",2007,,RISK ANALYSIS,27,1,271-281,WOS:000244798100022,10.1111/j.1539-6924.2006.00875.x,,#19553,Carey 2007,,
Paddle surfing for science on microplastic pollution,"Camins, E; de Haan, WP; Salvo, VS; Canals, M; Raffard, A; Sanchez-Vidal, A","Microplastics have pervaded all oceans on Earth and their impact on marine ecosystems is a matter of debate. However, there is a lack of information from a few meters from the coastline even though monitoring the nearshore is absolutely needed to fully understand the paths and magnitude of microplastic pollution, including its implications for coastal management and water quality. Traditional scientific data acquisition using conventional platforms such as research vessels or small boats is expensive and hampered by numerous limitations in the nearshore zone, ranging from too shallow (and risky) depths to the presence of swimmers. Here, we provide the scientific community with an affordable and easy to use manta trawl called paddle trawl to be attached to a paddle surf board to acquire scientific samples in the nearshore within the frame of a citizen science monitoring project with the Spanish delegation of the non-governmental organization Surfrider Foundation Europe. Our results show, as a proof of concept, that a lightweight and low-cost paddle trawl towed behind paddle surfers allows obtaining samples for microplastic characterization and quantification while raising awareness of pollution by the allochtonous particles. An average of 11.7 x 10(4) items km(-2) was found in the nearshore, similar to those found offshore in the Mediterranean Sea. However, a comparison with offshore data obtained with a standard manta trawl shows differences in plastic size distributions. Whereas microplastics dominated in offshore waters mesoplastics and macroplastics prevailed in the nearshore. A larger variety of polymers, including high-density ones and higher average lengths nearshore shows that this area is likely to produce and export microplastics towards offshore waters.

Selective commercial line fishing and biodiversity conservation co-exist on seamounts in a deepwater marine reserve,"Williams, A; Upston, J; Green, M; Graham, K","Enhanced socio-economic and conservation outcomes for both an existing fishery and a new deep-water marine reserve off eastern Australia were achieved by research that identified additional options for conservation managers. Commercial power hand-line fishing was permitted to continue on productive seamount fishing grounds within the reserve because new information enabled boundaries and zoning proposed in the reserve's draft Management Plan to be revised and consistent fisheries regulations to be formulated. The draft plan would have removed access to fishing grounds that provide approximately 25% of the annual regional Australian total allowable catch of the premium fishery species, Blue-eye Trevalla (Hyperoglyphe antarctica). Day-time power handline fishing in 280-550 m depths on Taupo and Barcoo Seamounts avoided Harrisson's Dogfish (Centrophorus harrissoni) - the primary species of conservation concern - because the shark is a diel vertical migrator, residing deeper than Blue-eye during the day before ascending to shallower depths at night to feed on micronekton. Harrisson's Dogfish occurs on several other seamounts where it was previously unrecorded. These results, together with expectation of low mortality of any incidental dogfish bycatch and low impacts on benthic habitats, supported changes to management arrangements which preserve the seamount Blue-eye fishery worth approximately A$1M annually whilst protecting more seamounts and greater areas of benthic habitat in the restricted 200-700 m depth range. Research uptake was facilitated by clarifying policy options at a critical stage in the planning process. This required having clearly articulated management objectives that aligned conservation and fishery imperatives, involving, knowledgeable fishers in making robust field observations to address specific knowledge gaps and management needs, and identifying the requirements for ongoing fishery monitoring that addresses remaining management uncertainties. This potential to identify win-win outcomes in the Australian marine planning process provides some general signposts for future policy decisions as marine reserve networks are implemented and reviewed, and for scientists wanting to effectively engage in decision-making processes.

Artisanal fishing communities elicit how contamination from industrial aquaculture is causing natural shellfish banks, fish populations and endangered cold corals to diminish. While fisheries and aquaculture governance are nominally governed by the same body, the ideological concerns of decision makers have not left space for the original users or ecological health. The right to good water quality and ecological health of artisanal fisher, original people and the broader coastal community are highlighted.

Diving in the contaminated areas confirmed the impacts using comparison with control sites. The article shows how new laws are need to assess nutrient loading, antibiotics and invasive species introduction. It links these impacts to literature in other countries where harmful algal blooms result from eutrophication from aquaculture contamination. It shows how the privatisation of space has left marine governance unable to take adequate enforcement.

The project focuses on the key points of OL and MCS, promoting a gradual implementation of scientific literacy in marine biology and coastal monitoring techniques in school curricula during a period of vertical and incremental long-lasting training, from kindergarten to university. ""Percorsi nel Blu"" harmonises the existing educational plans with the last recommendations of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda in order to improve the teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM disciplines). The OL process follows the complete educational path, actively involving students in the recognition of marine flora and fauna during research activities on the beach and scuba surveys in research campaigns. The great impact on the community, the remarkable number of participants and the relevant scientific results of the first records of alien and native species increase students' interest in STEM disciplines and marine sciences and encourage them to disseminate their experiences, thus creating the awareness of global citizenship, which includes the whole community, both inside and outside school.",2022,,MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE,23,2,405-416,WOS:000782845600001,10.12681/mms.27152,,#19575,Mioni 2022,,
An interdisciplinary evaluation of community-based TURF-reserves,"Villasenor-Derbez, JC; Aceves-Bueno, E; Fulton, S; Suarez, A; Hernandez-Velasco, A; Torre, J; Micheli, F","Coastal marine ecosystems provide livelihoods for small-scale fishers and coastal communities around the world. Small-scale fisheries face great challenges since they are difficult to monitor, enforce, and manage, which may lead to overexploitation. Combining territorial use rights for fisheries (TURF) with no-take marine reserves to create TURF-reserves can improve the performance of small-scale fisheries by buffering fisheries from environmental variability and management errors, while ensuring that fishers reap the benefits of conservation investments. Since 2012, 18 old and new community-based Mexican TURF-reserves gained legal recognition thanks to a regulation passed in 2012; their effectiveness has not been formally evaluated. We combine causal inference techniques and the Social-Ecological Systems framework to provide a holistic evaluation of community-based TURF-reserves in three coastal communities in Mexico. We find that, overall, reserves have not yet achieved their stated goals of increasing the density of lobster and other benthic invertebrates, nor increasing lobster catches. A lack of clear ecological and socioeconomic effects likely results from a combination of factors. First, some of these reserves might be too young for the effects to show (reserves were 6-10 years old). Second, the reserves are not large enough to protect mobile species, like lobster. Third, variable and extreme oceanographic conditions have impacted harvested populations. Fourth, local fisheries are already well managed, and while reserves may protect populations within its boundaries, it is unlikely that reserves might have a detectable effect in catches. However, even small reserves are expected to provide benefits for sedentary invertebrates over longer time frames, with continued protection. These reserves may provide a foundation for establishing additional, larger marine reserves needed to effectively conserve mobile species.",2019,,PLOS ONE,14,8,,WOS:000485041400065,10.1371/journal.pone.0221660,,#19577,Villasenor-Derbez 2019,,
Volume-based assessment of coastal litter reveals a significant underestimation of marine litter from ocean-based activities in East Asia,"Schneider, F; Lin, HT; Hu, CS; Hsu, CH; Yen, N","Most marine litter monitoring surveys are based on item count, leading to an underrepresentation of larger litter. To better understand significant sources, this study conducted a volume-based marine litter survey in 2020, covering 1% of Taiwan's 1680 km coastline. In four monitoring periods, a total of 636 m3 of marine litter was detected from which similar to 70% stemmed from derelict fishing gear (DFG), similar to 20% from plastic bottles and similar to 10% from other waste. Survey pictures revealed 66 types of DFG which were compiled into an index. The most frequent items were hard plastic buoys from China and Taiwan. At an average concentration of 877 dm(3)/100 m, Taiwan showed an extremely high level of DFG pollution.

Participatory mapping and fishers' knowledge about fish and shrimp migration in a subtropical coastal ecosystem,"Nunes, MUS; Cardoso, OR; Silvano, RAM; Favaro, LF","Fishers' ecological knowledge (FEK) has contributed to studies on the reproduction and migration of fish and marine invertebrates. With increasing accessibility to information technologies, several surveys have begun to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to access FEK through participatory mapping. Scientific knowledge on migration of fishery resources is fundamental to properly support initiatives for fisheries management. However, the technologies available to study migration are usually expensive and require several years of sampling. Our objective was to use GIS to access FEK and to identify the migration patterns of five fishery resources in a subtropical coastal ecosystem of the Southern Atlantic Ocean: the white catfish - Genidens barbus, the fat snook Centropomus parallelus, the common snook - Centropomus undecimalis, the Atlantic spadefish - Chaetodipterus faber and the white shrimp - Litopenaeus schmitti. We interviewed 132 fishers in the Paranagu ' a estuarine complex and its adjacent coastal zone, Brazil. Of these fishers, 39 participated in the participatory mapping process. Our results based on FEK indicated that the migration of fishery resources is reproductive and occurs mainly in the later spring and summer when the species enter or exit the estuarine complex from coastal zone. The participatory mapping results indicated that G. barbus and C. faber migrate from the coastal zone to the estuary, while Centropomus species and the shrimp L. schmitti exit the estuary towards the coastal zone. The information generated by FEK and the methods used should be considered in future studies on ethno ecological research and to understand reproductive migration of these species. Furthermore, these observations could support fisheries management and environmental impact assessment of infrastructure projects.",2021,,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,258,,,WOS:000677910800002,10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107412,,#19583,Nunes 2021,,
A framework for vulnerability assessment of coastal fisheries ecosystems to climate change-Tool for understanding resilience of fisheries (VA-TURF),"Mamauag, SS; Alino, PM; Martinez, RJS; Muallil, RN; Doctor, MVA; Dizon, EC; Geronimo, RC; Panga, FM; Cabral, RB","Vulnerability assessment (VA) is increasingly developed and utilized in various sectors and fields of society. VA provides a better understanding of the interactions among system, pressures, and threats, which serves as a basis for targeted adaptation strategies. The framework or tool named tool for understanding resilience of fisheries (VA-TURF) was developed to assess the vulnerability of the coastal fisheries ecosystems in the tropics to climate change. VA-TURF has three major components, namely, fisheries, reef ecosystem, and socio-economics. Although each component has intrinsic properties, the three components are strongly interrelated. Indicators associated to sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity were developed for each component of TURF. The exposure variable used was wave. VA-TURF uses information obtained through rapid assessments except for the reef ecosystem component. The analytical approach for integrating scores is straightforward and devoid of highly sophisticated mathematical methods. The utility of VA-TURF primarily considers the fishers of a coastal community (barangay) as the major stakeholder, thereby facilitating familiarization and community ownership of the tool. VA-TURF was demonstrated in all the coastal barangays of two island municipalities (Lubang and Looc, Occidental Mindoro, Philippines) located along the Verde Island Passage, which has the world's highest marine shore fish biodiversity. Local stakeholders such as fishers, barangay leaders, residents, and local executive staff of the two municipalities participated in the process of scoring and determining the vulnerability of the sites during a series of workshops. The local-level fisheries vulnerability assessment framework developed encourages community-level actions and provides opportunities for strategic actions and scaling-up of efforts at various governance levels.

Cetacean biodiversity in the Bay of Biscay: Suggestions for environmental protection derived from citizen science data,"Matear, L; Robbins, JR; Hale, M; Potts, J","Cetacean communities face significant threats from adverse interactions with human activities such as bycatch, vessel collision, and environmental pollution. Monitoring of marine mammal populations can help to assess and safeguard marine biodiversity for future generations. Traditional surveys can be costly and time-consuming to undertake, but we explore the ability of citizen science to inform environmental assessments and subsequent conservation management. We use data collected from platforms of opportunity within the Bay of Biscay to investigate spatial changes in cetacean diversity, with the aim of identifying hotspots which may be suitable for further investigation and conservation. Seventeen species of cetaceans were recorded over a ten year period, many of which are data deficient in European waters (e.g. Bottlenose dolphin, Short-beaked common dolphin, Striped dolphin, Risso's dolphin, Long-finned pilot whale, Killer whale, Northern bottlenose whale, Cuvier's beaked whale, Sowerby's beaked whale and Trues beaked whale). Biodiversity (determined by Simpson's Diversity index) ranged from 0.19 to 0.77. The central and southern areas of the survey area indicated the highest biodiversity (0.65-0.77), and these locations may benefit most from protection as Important Marine Mammal Areas. We present a case for this designation, and discuss the benefits and limitations of citizen science for informing conservation action.",2019,,MARINE POLICY,109,,,WOS:000497592800007,10.1016/j.marpol.2019.103672,,#19590,Matear 2019,,
"""It's About Seeing What's Actually Out There"": Quantifying fishers' ecological knowledge and biases in a small-scale commercial fishery as a path toward co-management","Carr, LM; Heyman, WD","As fishery science continues to make strides toward stakeholder-inclusive, co-management styles of fishery management, there remain concerns on how the participation of commercial fishers affects the direction of regulations, particularly where perceptions of fisher bias and self-interest dominate. Fishers, particularly in small-scale, artisanal fisheries, possess valuable fishers' ecological knowledge (FEK) on the status and trends of their resources and can provide valuable input during regulatory negotiations. FEK provides a second source of ecosystem information, and can be applied to management where other forms of data may be absent or difficult to regularly obtain through traditional research and monitoring approaches. The Q-Method was used to measure the subjective behaviors and biases of 42 commercial fishers and 54 island residents representing other stakeholder groups in St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands. This research shows that commercial fishers possess a unique, biased perspective that is identifiable against other stakeholder groups when issues of how best to manage the island's fishery resources arise. Within the commercial fishing community, a range of perspectives also exist, from those skeptical of management and discount concerns of unsustainable fishing effort to those who recognize the need for locally-appropriate management and consider their own involvement in management meetings to be instrumental in developing any such measures. By tapping into FEK, fishing behavior, and stakeholder biases, management decisions become more informed and opportunities to develop co-management increase. Such engagement efforts are particularly relevant for data-poor fisheries. FEK provides an alternate path from which to more fully understand fishery health and trends, thereby establishing the foundation from which locally appropriate and supported fishery management can form. FEK can also act as a bridge by managers to more fully invest in relationships and partnerships with the fishing community, thereby strengthening the fishers' sense of ""ownership"" of an otherwise common-pool resource, and allowing for the development of adaptive co-management opportunities that address the immediate needs of the fishery.

Patterns in artisanal coral reef fisheries revealed through local monitoring efforts,"Delaney, DG; Teneva, LT; Stamoulis, KA; Giddens, JL; Koike, H; Ogawa, T; Friedlander, AM; Kittinger, JN","Sustainable fisheries management is key to restoring and maintaining ecological function and benefits to people, but it requires accurate information about patterns of resource use, particularly fishing pressure. In most coral reef fisheries and other data-poor contexts, obtaining such information is challenging and remains an impediment to effective management. We developed the most comprehensive regional view of shore-based fishing effort and catch published to date, to show detailed fishing patterns from across the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). We reveal these regional patterns through fisher ""creel"" surveys conducted by local communities, state agencies, academics, and/or environmental organizations, at 18 sites, comprising > 10,000 h of monitoring across a range of habitats and human influences throughout the MHI. All creel surveys included in this study except for one were previously published in some form (peer-reviewed articles or gray literature reports). Here, we synthesize these studies to document spatial patterns in nearshore fisheries catch, effort, catch rates (i.e., catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE)), and catch disposition (i.e., use of fish after catch is landed). This effort provides for a description of general regional patterns based on these location-specific studies. Line fishing was by far the dominant gear type employed. The most efficient gear (i.e., highest CPUE) was spear (0.64 kg h(-1)), followed closely by net (0.61 kg h(-1)), with CPUE for line (0.16 kg h(-1)) substantially lower than the other two methods. Creel surveys also documented illegal fishing activity across the studied locations, although these activities were not consistent across sites. Overall, most of the catch was not sold, but rather retained for home consumption or given away to extended family, which suggests that cultural practices and food security may be stronger drivers of fishing effort than commercial exploitation for coral reef fisheries in Hawai'i. Increased monitoring of spatial patterns in nearshore fisheries can inform targeted management, and can help communities develop a more informed understanding of the drivers of marine resource harvest and the state of the resources, in order to maintain these fisheries for food security, cultural practices, and ecological value.",2017,,PEERJ,5,,,WOS:000417097900003,10.7717/peerj.4089,,#19595,Delaney 2017,,
Ocean-scale footprint of a highly mobile fishing fleet: Social-ecological drivers of fleet behaviour and evidence of illegal fishing,"Collins, C; Nuno, A; Benaragama, A; Broderick, A; Wijesundara, I; Wijetunge, D; Letessier, TB","1. Managing the footprint of highly mobile fishing fleets is increasingly important due to continuing declines in fish populations. However, social-ecological drivers for fisher behaviour remain poorly understood for many fleets globally.2. Using the Sri Lankan fleet as a case study, we explored the role of social, environmental and policy drivers of effort distribution and illegal fishing. We used semi-structured interviews and participatory mapping with 95 fishers, combined with explanatory modelling (GLM) and multivariate statistics, including principal component analysis (PCA).3. Our findings highlighted the broad footprint (similar to 3,800,000 km(2)) of this fleet, with fishing effort expended in high seas (53.9%), domestic (40.9%) and, illegally, in foreign waters (5.2%). Twenty-six per cent of fishers directly admitted to fishing illegally in foreign waters during interviews, whereas 62% of fishers indicated doing so during participatory mapping.4. GLMs explained underlying decisions of where to fish (36% of the total deviance in effort distribution) as a function of social variables (14%), notably distance from landing sites (13%), and environmental variables (11%), notably sea surface temperature (10%).5. Multivariate analysis revealed that individual fisher characteristics associated with illegal fishing, such as a level of reliance on sharks, vary across the fleet. The analysis of qualitative data suggested that the influence of interpersonal and community social networks and perceptions of higher catch value, particularly of sharks, may be important.6. Our approach demonstrated the utility of mixed methods research, including the collection of qualitative data, for creating a detailed understanding of spatial behaviour, including decisions of whether to fish illegally.7. Results highlighted the importance of adopting a social-ecological lens to investigate drivers for human behaviour and non-compliance with rules. We advocate for a nuanced approach to monitoring and managing of fleets, including investigating localised social drivers for illegal fishing and enhancing regional transparency in fleet monitoring.",2021,,PEOPLE AND NATURE,3,3,740-755,WOS:000654251300001,10.1002/pan3.10213,,#19596,Collins 2021,,
How to articulate the multiple value dimensions of ecosystem services? Insights from implementing the PArticulatES framework in a coastal social-ecological system in Portugal,"Lopes, R; Videira, N","Ecosystem services is a value-laden concept, encompassing multiple legitimate views, value systems and potential controversies. On the other hand, it offers a platform to promote participation and to search for new paths of collaborative action. Based on these assumptions this work aims to answer the question ""how to structure a participatory process for the integration and articulation of multiple values of ecosystem services to inform decision-making processes in a coastal social-ecological system?"". This paper outlines a three-stage participatory framework (PArticulatES) that was developed to scope, conceptualize and articulate ecosystem services values. The PArticulatES framework was piloted in a coastal and marine protected area: the Arrabida Natural Park in Portugal. The pilot test results and participants' evaluation on the process allowed the identification of valuable lessons and critical factors for the success of the implementation of the framework. The proposed three-stage process was able to provide a coherent platform for engaging stakeholders in ecosystem services scoping, assessment and decision support. Key outcomes regarding knowledge sharing and co-creation are conducive to social learning about ecosystem services. Ultimately, this framework offers structured guidelines for teasing out multiple value dimensions, which may be applied to different types of decision processes in coastal and marine ecosystems. However, some challenges may arise when implementing this framework. Those include a dependency on a steering team with adequate skills and resources to support each process stage, a sustained level of participants' engagement throughout the sequence of events, and a commitment from decision-makers' regarding the consideration of process outcomes.",2019,,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES,38,,,WOS:000476882200016,10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.100955,,#19601,Lopes 2019,,
Implementing the Western Gulf of Maine Area Closure: The Role and Perception of Fishers' Ecological Knowledge,"Nenadovic, M; Johnson, T; Wilson, J","The debate about the quality of fishers' ecological knowledge (FEK) and its value to fisheries management has long been present in the literature. This study sought to understand the role of FEK in a particular fisheries management decision in the U. S. and to evaluate the extent that different stakeholder groups recognized and used FEK in fisheries policy creation. The 1998 implementation of the Western Gulf of Maine Area Closure (WGoMAC) was a management response to the rapid decline in the Gulf of Maine cod (Gadus morhua) stock. Using structured surveys and semistructured interviews, we collected information from major stakeholder groups that were active during the creation of the area closure: New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) members, Groundfish Advisory Panel members, Groundfish Plan Development Team members, and Maine groundfishers. Results indicated that 95% of respondents believed that fishers possess ecological knowledge that could be useful in the fishery management process. In the case of the WGoMAC creation, 62% of respondents indicated that FEK played a role in the decision, even though 85% recognized obstacles to the use of FEK in the management process. Interviews demonstrated that FEK was able to improve upon the spatial resolution of scientific data by identifying seasonal migration patterns of prespawning cod and behavioral differences between juvenile and adult cod. This information was a product of a peer-reviewed process among groundfishers and it was used to fine-tune the exact location of the closure. These findings suggest that there are ways to incorporate FEK into fishery management for the purposes of stock and habitat conservation. Additionally, the benefit of having ecological information that spans different spatial scales for fishery management was observed in this study. By combining the knowledge systems of fishers and fisheries scientists, managers were able to capture ecological information at a finer scale than the scale at which landings data are reported and fish stocks analyzed.",2012,,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,17,1,,WOS:000302713700001,10.5751/ES-04431-170120,,#19606,Nenadovic 2012,,
"Mapping of ecosystem services flow in Mida Creek, Kenya","Owuor, MA; Icely, J; Newton, A; Nyunja, J; Otieno, P; Tuda, AO; Oduor, N","The concept of ecosystem services (ES) and its application in natural resources management decision making is a new conservation paradigm. A better understanding of ES in resource-rich developing countries can contribute to poverty alleviation and sustainable development, while at the same time conserving natural resources. This study assessed the flow of ES in Mida Creek, a marine reserve in Kenya, with the aim of characterizing land use/land cover (LULC) classes, spatially mapping distribution of ES, identifying important ES, and establishing the opinions of experts on ES flow. A qualitative and quantitative assessment was carried out coupling expert scores and LULC maps in a matrix structure. A participatory approach was used to engage and raise awareness with the community groups who actively participate in conservation activities in the creek, together with researchers/academics/managers who also are involved with the management of the reserve. The study was carried out between July and October 2015 and a total of 65 participants were involved. Datasets were collected using questionnaires in which ecosystem service flow was scored based on expert estimates per LULC class against the selected ES. Data were assessed using statistical and spatial analysis techniques. Results for the flow of provisioning services showed that, while palm trees were the main source of firewood (68%), other vegetation types were also an important source for wood products, including charcoal (46%), construction poles (54%) and fishing gear (68%). There was also a high flow of provisioning services (sea food and bait organisms) from water bodies (82%) and mangroves (80%). Flow for regulating services was mainly from mangroves, and for cultural services from beaches, mangroves and water bodies. Saline bare areas and sand flats scored least for all the ES. There were statistically significant differences in the scoring of the LULC against the different categories of provisioning, regulating and cultural services between the local communities and the other stakeholders. The method shows both the location of the resources utilized by the communities and, also, facilitates communication between these communities and the decision makers, thereby providing an example of a Management strategy at the local scale for other coastal regions of Kenya and elsewhere.

Detecting fisheries trends in a co-managed area in the Kingdom of Tonga,"Webster, FJ; Cohen, PJ; Malimali, S; Tauati, M; Vidler, K; Mailau, S; Vaipuna, L; Fatongiatau, V","Community based and co-management approaches are increasingly used strategies for marine conservation and sustainable management in the tropical Pacific. However, our understanding of the effectiveness of co-management on marine resources and socio economic conditions is relatively limited, often due to insufficient resources to support monitoring based on ecological condition or catch landings data. Monitoring programmes based on the perceptions of resource users are often presented as a cost effective alternative to understanding the status and changes in resource and socio economic conditions. Ecological, catch landings and perception-based data, and their collection methods, have different benefits and limitations for community-based programmes. Here we present a study of the first community-based, co-managed area in the Kingdom of Tonga the small island of 'O'ua. We examine both perception based data from interviews and catch landings data to describe fishing activities, catches and changes in resource status and socio economic conditions since the inception of co-management. Landings data were collected by the community over a five year period; perceptions of change and management performance were collected through structured interviews with fishers based on the same time period. The majority of fishing within the 'O'ua co-managed area was by men, using hand spears in fibreglass vessels <5 m in length powered by an outboard engine. We found that catch per unit effort was high (especially the estimates generated from perception data) compared to other parts of the Pacific. Since the inception of co-management fishers reported improved socio economic conditions, a greater sense of stewardship over resources, active involvement in management and the effective exclusion of 'outside' fishers. We compared catch and catch-per-unit-effort estimates generated from landings and perception data. While fishers perceived that catches had improved since the inception of co-management, landings data suggested that catches were either stable or declining. These differences are important as they would suggest very different management responses. We discuss the trade-offs between the catch landings and perception data in terms of accuracy, precision, participation and cost for the purpose of guiding adjustments to co-management.

Temporal Trends and Potential Drivers of Stranded Marine Debris on Beaches Within Two US National Marine Sanctuaries Using Citizen Science Data,"Uhrin, AV; Lippiatt, S; Herring, CE; Dettloff, K; Bimrose, K; Butler-Minor, C","Marine debris is a threat to our ocean that can be more effectively addressed through monitoring and assessment of items stranded on shorelines. This study engaged citizen scientists to conduct shoreline marine debris surveys according to a published NOAA protocol within the Greater Farallones and Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuaries on the west coast of the United States. Here, we use the results of these multi-year monitoring data to estimate marine debris abundance and temporal trends, and identify drivers of debris loads. Changes in debris counts and composition are shown to reflect seasonal patterns of coastal upwelling and downwelling, but longer temporal trends in overall debris loads depend on the sampling window. Identifying drivers of stranded debris is challenging given the observational nature of the data. A linear increase in total expected debris counts was observed when up to five participants are conducting a survey, suggesting a need to standardize the number of participants and their search pattern for debris in shoreline monitoring efforts.

A framework for mapping small-scale coastal fisheries using fishers' knowledge,"Leopold, M; Guillemot, N; Rocklin, D; Chen, C","Collecting spatial information on fisheries catch and effort is essential to understanding the spatial processes of exploited population dynamics and to manage heterogeneously distributed resources and uses. The use of fishers' knowledge through geographical information systems (GISs) is increasingly considered as a promising source of local information on small-scale coastal fisheries. In this paper we describe the first framework for mapping entire small-scale coastal fisheries using fishers' knowledge on catch size and fishing effort. Four mangrove and coral reef fisheries targeting invertebrates or finfish in New Caledonia (southwest Pacific) were mapped following a five-step framework: (i) stratified random sampling of regular fishers; (ii) collection of fishers' knowledge of fishing areas, fishing effort, and catch size through map-based interviews; (iii) data integration into a spatial geodatabase; (iv) statistical extrapolation of fisher data to the fishery scale; and (v) mapping of catch, effort, and catch per unit effort (CPUE) for each fishery using a GIS overlay procedure. We found evidence that fishers' knowledge supplied precise and accurate quantitative and spatial information on catch size, fishing effort and CPUE for entire fisheries. Fisheries maps captured the fine-scale spatial distribution of fishing activities in a variety of ways according to target taxa, gear type, and home ports. Applications include area-based marine conservation planning and fishery monitoring, management, and governance.

Mixed methods participatory GIS: An evaluation of the validity of qualitative and quantitative mapping methods,"Brown, G; Strickland-Munro, J; Kobryn, H; Moore, SA","Participatory mapping in social research is characterized by methodological pluralism, with two common methods being qualitative mapping using stakeholder interviews and quantitative methods that engage larger public samples through digital, internet mapping. To date, there has been no systematic evaluation of the extent to which mixed methods in participatory mapping yield valid results when applied to the same research setting and research questions. A mixed methods research design (combined exploratory sequential and convergent parallel) was implemented in a large research project to identify marine and coastal values in the Kimberley region of Australia. Qualitative interviews (n = 167) were completed with stakeholders to identify place-based values using polygon mapping methods and internet-based public participation GIS-(PPGIS) methods (n = 578). We defined and operationalized the concepts of concurrent, commensurate, and convergent validity to assess mixed methods research outcomes. We found that qualitative and quantitative methods resulted in moderate to high concurrent validity when assessing the importance of place values in the study area. Convergent validity (spatial) was highly variable by place value, with stronger convergent validity found with mapped aesthetic, recreational fishing, tourism, biodiversity, and Aboriginal culture values, and weakest with existence, therapeutic, and commercial fishing values. Convergent validity was influenced by weak commensurate validity through the use of different geometric features (polygons versus points) for mapping values across a large study area. The utility of mixed methods for planning decision support in a convergent parallel design depends on demonstrating convergence in construct meaning, spatial location, and consistency in values in the sampling populations.

Large-scale monitoring is necessary to understand the effects of anthropogenic threats and environmental change on coral reef habitats and citizen science programs can support this effort. Seventy-two marine taxa found in the Red Sea were surveyed by non-specialist volunteers during their regular recreational dives, using SCUBA Tourism for the Environment (STE) questionnaires. Over a period of 4-years, 7,125 divers completed 17,905 questionnaires (14,487 diving hours). Validation trials were carried out to assess the data reliability (Cronbach's alpha > 50 % in 83.6 % of validation trials), showing that non-specialists performed similarly to conservation volunteer divers on accurate transect. The resulting sightings-based index showed that the biodiversity status did not change significantly within the project time scale, but revealed spatial trends across areas subjected to different protection strategies. Higher biodiversity values were found in Sharm el-Sheikh, within protected Ras Mohammed National Park and Tiran Island, than in the less-regulated Hurghada area. Citizen science programs like STEproject represent novel, reliable, cost-effective models for biodiversity monitoring, which can be sustained and embedded within long-term monitoring programmes, and extended to include a wider geographical scale, while increasing the environmental education of the public.",2015,,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,24,2,319-336,WOS:000348114700007,10.1007/s10531-014-0810-7,,#19624,Branchini 2015,,
Evaluation of the effectiveness of three underwater reef fish monitoring methods in Fiji,"Leopold, M; Cakacaka, A; Meo, S; Sikolia, J; Lecchini, D","Locally based and volunteer-based monitoring approaches have recently received greater attention as a cost-effective way to collect data on the environment and/or involve stakeholders in management. The present study compared three monitoring methods based on an underwater visual census (UVC) of reef fish in a customary area in Navakavu (Viti Levu Island, Fiji). Two non-scientific approaches involved (1) snorkellers from the village using vernacular names for five local focal fish taxa and (2) non-resident volunteers using the Reef Check target list of fish for the Indo-Pacific (nine focal taxa). These approaches were cross-checked with a comprehensive scientific survey (all fish recorded at the species level across 12 families). The three methods were compared in terms of accuracy, precision, and ability to highlight changes in fish abundance between the community-managed no-take zone (NTZ) and the fished area. We found that scientific and volunteer-based data were consistent in terms of means and variance of abundance estimates but that Reef Check focal taxa would not be suitable for monitoring the Navakavu marine area. On the contrary, the locally selected target taxa were appropriate but overestimates and imprecision were noticed in the fish counts made by the community members. Differences in abundance of two major target taxa (Lethrinidae and Mullidae) between the NTZ and the harvest area were not validated by the scientific observations. Calibration of community-based UVC is thus needed especially if information from the local biological monitoring program is used to guide management actions.",2009,,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,18,13,3367-3382,WOS:000271941900003,10.1007/s10531-009-9646-y,,#19632,Leopold 2009,,
"Eliciting local knowledge of ecosystem services using participatory mapping and Photovoice: A case study of Tun Mustapha Park, Malaysia","Lim, VC; Justine, EV; Yusof, K; Ariffin, WNSWM; Goh, HC; Fadzil, KS","Protected areas in Malaysia have always been managed using top-down approach that often exclude the local communities, who are the main users of ecosystem services, from the planning and management. However, a newly established multiple-use marine park in Malaysia, Tun Mustapha Park (TMP), aims for inclusivity in managing the park. This research explores different participatory approaches (i.e. participatory mapping and Photovoice) to understand the ecosystem services and the dynamics surrounding the services in TMP. Community-based organisations and a mariculture farm in TMP were invited to participate in this work. The participants mapped the ecosystem services and provided in-depth qualitative data that supported the maps, besides highlighting ecological, sociocultural and economic issues surrounding the ecosystem services. Furthermore, the participants provided suggestions and recommendations that carry political effects. Therefore, the participatory approaches employed here had provided rich visual and spatial data to enhance the ecosystem-based management of TMP besides empowering the participants to voice out for their communities. The results generated from this work were also further utilised to fill in the gaps of knowledge in a separate ecosystem service assessment matrix. However, the output from participatory approaches should not be considered as the ultimate outcome but rather as supplement to the planning and management of TMP due to potential human errors and biases. Although the participatory approaches came with limitations and challenges that may have affected the findings here, these nonetheless had provided support to the capability of local communities to provide information crucial for management of protected areas as well as room for improvement for further work.",2021,,PLOS ONE,16,7,,WOS:000674301400040,10.1371/journal.pone.0253740,,#19633,Lim 2021,,
"C30-A simple, rapid, scientifically valid, and low-cost method for citizen-scientists to monitor coral reefs","Licuanan, WY; Mordeno, PZB; Go, MV","The extent and speed of recent changes in reef coral abundances due to ocean warming and human impacts require more widespread capability to map and measure these changes, especially in countries like the Philippines. We present ""C30"", a simple, rapid, scientifically valid, and low-cost method for skin divers or freedivers to take random photo-quadrat images within predefined stations on the upper reef slope. C30 yields coral cover data similar to those collected using the more intensive C5 method and can be as powerful in detecting small differences in reef cover. Less time is also needed for training personnel and sampling. However, more photo-quadrat images, better cameras, and closer collaboration with local scientists are required if higher precision data and estimates of coral diversity are needed from C30. C30 is a valuable tool for participatory, community-based citizen science monitoring of coral reefs.

"Marine debris in central California: Quantifying type and abundance of beach litter in Monterey Bay, CA","Rosevelt, C; Los Huertos, M; Garza, C; Nevins, HM","Monitoring beach litter is essential for reducing ecological threats towards humans and wildlife. In Monterey Bay, CA information on seasonal and spatial patterns is understudied. Central California's coastal managers require reliable information on debris abundance, distribution, and type, to support policy aimed at reducing litter. We developed a survey method that allowed for trained citizen scientists to quantify the types and abundance of beach litter. Sampling occurred from July 2009-June 2010. Litter abundance ranged from 0.03 to 17.1 items m(-2). Using a mixed model approach, we found season and location have the greatest effect on litter abundance. Styrofoam, the most numerically abundant item, made up 41% of the total amount of litter. Unexpected items included fertilizer pellets. The results of this study provide a baseline on the types and abundance of litter on the central coast and have directly supported policy banning Styrofoam take out containers from local municipalities.

Distribution and abundance of small plastic debris on beaches in the SE Pacific (Chile): A study supported by a citizen science project,"Hidalgo-Ruz, V; Thiel, M","The accumulation of large and small plastic debris is a problem throughout the world's oceans and coastlines. Abundances and types of small plastic debris have only been reported for some isolated beaches in the SE Pacific, but these data are insufficient to evaluate the situation in this region. The citizen science project ""National Sampling of Small Plastic Debris"" was supported by schoolchildren from all over Chile who documented the distribution and abundance of small plastic debris on Chilean beaches. Thirty-nine schools and nearly 1000 students from continental Chile and Easter Island participated in the activity. To validate the data obtained by the students, all samples were recounted in the laboratory. The results of the present study showed that the students were able to follow the instructions and generate reliable data. The average abundance obtained was 27 small plastic pieces per m(2) for the continental coast of Chile, but the samples from Easter Island had extraordinarily higher abundances (>800 items per m(2)). The abundance of small plastic debris on the continental coast could be associated with coastal urban centers and their economic activities. The high abundance found on Easter Island can be explained mainly by the transport of plastic debris via the surface currents in the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre, resulting in the accumulation of small plastic debris on the beaches of the island. This first report of the widespread distribution and abundance of small plastic debris on Chilean beaches underscores the need to extend plastic debris research to ecological aspects of the problem and to improve waste management.

"A Citizen Science Approach: A Detailed Ecological Assessment of Subtropical Reefs at Point Lookout, Australia","Roelfsema, C; Thurstan, R; Beger, M; Dudgeon, C; Loder, J; Kovacs, E; Gallo, M; Flower, J; Cabrera, KLG; Ortiz, J; Lea, A; Kleine, D","Subtropical reefs provide an important habitat for flora and fauna, and proper monitoring is required for conservation. Monitoring these exposed and submerged reefs is challenging and available resources are limited. Citizen science is increasing in momentum, as an applied research tool and in the variety of monitoring approaches adopted. This paper aims to demonstrate an ecological assessment and mapping approach that incorporates both top-down (volunteer marine scientists) and bottom-up (divers/community) engagement aspects of citizen science, applied at a subtropical reef at Point Lookout, Southeast Queensland, Australia. Marine scientists trained fifty citizen scientists in survey techniques that included mapping of habitat features, recording of substrate, fish and invertebrate composition, and quantifying impacts (e.g., occurrence of substrate damage, presence of litter). In 2014 these volunteers conducted four seasonal surveys along semi-permanent transects, at five sites, across three reefs. The project presented is a model on how citizen science can be conducted in a marine environment through collaboration of volunteer researchers, non-researchers and local marine authorities. Significant differences in coral and algal cover were observed among the three sites, while fluctuations in algal cover were also observed seasonally. Differences in fish assemblages were apparent among sites and seasons, with subtropical fish groups observed more commonly in colder seasons. The least physical damage occurred in the most exposed sites (Flat Rock) within the highly protected marine park zones. The broad range of data collected through this top-down/bottom-up approach to citizen science exemplifies the projects' value and application for identifying ecosystem trends or patterns. The results of the project support natural resource and marine park management, providing a valuable contribution to existing scientific knowledge and the conservation of local reefs.",2016,,PLOS ONE,11,10,,WOS:000385697200043,10.1371/journal.pone.0163407,,#19646,Roelfsema 2016,,
Continental patterns in marine debris revealed by a decade of citizen science,"Gacutan, J; Johnston, EL; Tait, H; Smith, W; Clark, GF","Anthropogenic marine debris is a persistent threat to oceans, imposing risks to ecosystems and the communities they support. Whilst an understanding of marine debris risks is steadily advancing, monitoring at spatial and temporal scales relevant to management remains limited. Citizen science projects address this shortcoming but are often critiqued on data accuracy and potential bias in sampling efforts. Here we present 10-years of Australia's largest marine debris database -the Australian Marine Debris Initiative (AMDI), in which we perform systematic data filtering, test for differences between collecting groups, and report patterns in marine debris. We defined five stages of data filtering to address issues in data quality and to limit inference to ocean-facing sandy beaches. Significant differences were observed in the average accumulation of items between filtered and re-maining data. Further, differences in sampling were compared between collecting groups at the same site (e.g., government, NGOs, and schools), where no significant differences were observed. The filtering process re-moved 21% of events due to data quality issues and a further 42% of events to restrict analyses to ocean-facing sandy beaches. The remaining 7275 events across 852 sites allowed for an assessment of debris patterns atan un-precedented spatial and temporal resolution. Hard plastics were the most common material found on beaches both nationally and regionally, consisting of up to 75% of total debris. Nationally, land and sea-sourced items accounted for 48% and 7% of debris, respectively, with most debris found on the east coast of Australia. This study demonstrates the value of citizen science datasets with broad spatial and temporal coverage, and the im-portance of data filtering to improve data quality. The citizen science presented provides an understanding of debris patterns on Australia's ocean beaches and can serve as a foundation for future source reduction plans. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Involvement of recreational scuba divers in emblematic species monitoring: The case of Mediterranean red coral (Corallium rubrum),"Bramanti, L; Vielmini, I; Rossi, S; Stolfa, S; Santangelo, G","Large-scale monitoring programs are fundamental for the management of overexploited or endangered species. When resources are limited, volunteer data collection is an alternative for researchers needing a large amount of data covering a wide geographic extension. Corallium rubrum is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. Some coastal populations have been deeply studied although there is still lack of knowledge about the distribution or even its presence along Italian coasts. The present work represents cooperation between University of Pisa and SSI-Italy. Recreational scuba divers have been involved in a monitoring project which aims to acquire data on Italian red coral shallow-water populations and increase the awareness of such an emblematic and patrimonial species. During summer 2008 a questionnaire was distributed to recreational divers. The 616 questionnaires analysed, covering more than 1600 km of coasts and 390 h of diving, showed an awareness of recreational divers towards red coral; 80% planned their dive aiming to find red coral and 4% reported colony damage. The same methodology applied in other countries could provide useful and comparable data on this precious marine species. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Since the first apparition of the species in the Strait of Gibraltar in 2015, its fast dispersion along the introduced habitats constitutes a real challenge to develop monitoring strategies that ahead of its impacts. The present study uses three different approaches to address impacts on the benthic ecosystems, at the same time offers relevant data for future management actions in El Estrecho Natural Park (PNE). Information obtained by monitoring permanent sentinel stations revealed a significant loss in resident species coverage after the moment of maximum growth in 2017. Thus, despite coverage of R. okamurae did not strongly varied in the latter years, impacts generated remain high in the habitats studied. Estimations of the invasive species coverage by combining cartographic image analysis and in situ data predicted a major occupation (over 85% coverage) between 10 and 30 m, coinciding with the maximum rocky surface areas (m(2)) mapped on the PNE. Furthermore, a Citizen Science research collaboration evidenced impacts on the benthic seascape through an ad hoc exploration of images that allowed a ""before"" and ""after"" comparison of the invasion process in the same geographic locations. This has made it possible to graphically demonstrate severe changes in the underwater seascape and, therefore, the general impact of this new biological invasion. The spatial colonization estimations combined with the impacts reported by both scientific [Sessile Bioindicators in Permanent Quadrats (SBPQ) sentinel stations] and civilian (Citizen Science) monitoring methodologies claim the urgent development of further studies that allow the design of monitoring strategies against R. okamurae expansion across the Mediterranean and Atlantic waters.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,9,,,WOS:000645110000001,10.3389/fevo.2021.639161,,#19652,Garcia-Gomez 2021,,
USING PHOTOGRAPHIC IDENTIFICATION TO MONITOR SEA TURTLE POPULATIONS AT PERHENTIAN ISLANDS MARINE PARK IN MALAYSIA,"Long, SL; Azmi, NA","Perhentian Islands Marine Park is home to foraging and nesting Green Turtles (Chelonia mydas) and Hawksbill Turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) but little information is available other than nesting trends and hatching success. We used photographic identification (photo-ID) methods to identify individuals and to determine their sex ratios, habitat use, and site fidelity. We collected 1,826 sightings between 2009 and 2015 from conservation projects (998 in-water sightings, 184 nesting sightings) and members of the public (639 in-water sightings, five nesting sightings), and used NaturePatternMatch (NPM) software and manual visual matching to identify individuals. We identified 120 (minimum) to 131 (maximum) individual Green Turtles, including a maximum of 17 males, 58 females and 56 turtles of unknown sex from both in-water and nesting beach sightings. We identified 20 (minimum) to 23 (maximum) individual Hawksbills of unknown sex from in-water sightings. Green Turtles were sighted most frequently at seagrass beds and Hawksbills only among coral reefs. We resighted 47 Greens and eight Hawksbills between one and 144 times (mean = 23.1 times). Nesting Greens also showed strong site fidelity, although the nesting home range for some individuals included different beaches on adjacent islands within approximately 30 km. We identified boat-related injuries in eight turtles and mortalities of two turtles.

Citizen scientists undertook a one-day training program, which addressed data collection skills and academic topics in the national science curriculum. A subset of teachers and corporate sponsor staff participated in an intensive multi-day training program with researchers before venturing into the field. Data collected by citizen scientists were compared with data collected by researchers at nearby locations. We found the citizen science data were of equivalent quality to those collected by researchers, but there were differences among students. Primary school students detected more debris than did older secondary students. Students detected small items (<1 cm(2)), and were as accurate as researchers in identifying debris type and size categories. However, sampling approach was important students detected more debris during quadrat searches than during strip transects. Comparing researcher effort to volunteer-collected data, citizen scientists were often more efficient (per m(2)) than researchers, at collecting marine debris, but the results varied among methods.

New opportunities for conservation of handfishes (Family Brachionichthyidae) and other inconspicuous and threatened marine species through citizen science,"Edgar, GJ; Stuart-Smith, RD; Cooper, A; Jacques, M; Valentine, J","Volunteer divers participating in the Reef Life Survey (RLS) program actively assist species conservation efforts by generating data for threat assessments and population trend monitoring, through in-water restoration efforts, and through outreach of marine conservation messages. Up to 2014, standardised underwater visual survey data provided by RLS divers described densities of 495 cryptic fish species at over 1200 sites distributed around Australia. Each species was recorded on 34 separate transect blocks on average, allowing the first assessments of population trends for many species. These data highlight the threatened and data deficient status of endemic Australian handfish species. At least five shallow-water handfish species are potentially threatened, including the smooth handfish Sympterichthys unipennis, which has not been sighted for over 200 years, but is yet to be included on any threatened species list. RLS divers undertook directed searches at key historical locations for two handfish species, the red handfish Thymichthys politus, now only known from a single reef, and Ziebell's handfish Brachiopsilus ziebelli, with no confirmed sighting for over a decade. From a total of 100 h of underwater search effort, only four red handfish were recorded, all at a site threatened by adjacent human activity. These and other handfish species should be considered for inclusion on the IUCN Red List given that populations are either very small or have vanished, spawning substrates have probably declined, and the species lack a larval dispersal stage. More importantly, the absence of information on the conservation status of the majority of marine species needs urgent attention, including through expanded citizen science efforts, if management intervention is to occur and extinctions minimised.

Rapid survey protocol that provides dynamic information on reef condition to managers of the Great Barrier Reef,"Beeden, RJ; Turner, MA; Dryden, J; Merida, F; Goudkamp, K; Malone, C; Marshall, PA; Birtles, A; Maynard, JA","Managing to support coral reef resilience as the climate changes requires strategic and responsive actions that reduce anthropogenic stress. Managers can only target and tailor these actions if they regularly receive information on system condition and impact severity. In large coral reef areas like the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP), acquiring condition and impact data with good spatial and temporal coverage requires using a large network of observers. Here, we describe the result of similar to 10 years of evolving and refining participatory monitoring programs used in the GBR that have rangers, tourism operators and members of the public as observers. Participants complete Reef Health and Impact Surveys (RHIS) using a protocol that meets coral reef managers' needs for up-to-date information on the following: benthic community composition, reef condition and impacts including coral diseases, damage, predation and the presence of rubbish. Training programs ensure that the information gathered is sufficiently precise to inform management decisions. Participants regularly report because the demands of the survey methodology have been matched to their time availability. Undertaking the RHIS protocol we describe involves three similar to 20 min surveys at each site. Participants enter data into an online data management system that can create reports for managers and participants within minutes of data being submitted. Since 2009, 211 participants have completed a total of more than 10,415 surveys at more than 625 different reefs.

"The role of conservation volunteers in the detection, monitoring and management of invasive alien lionfish","Anderson, LG; Chapman, JK; Escontrela, D; Gough, CLA","Across the Caribbean, targeted fishing is gaining momentum as a cost-effective method to control invasive alien lionfish (Pterois volitans and Pterois miles) by suppressing population numbers below site-specific threshold levels i.e. a population density that is predicted to cause declines in native fish biomass. Yet in marine reserve no take zones (NTZs) or reefs at depths of > 18 m) where commercial fishing is either not permitted or impractical, alternative methods of lionfish control are required. This study evaluates the potential for conservation volunteers to act as citizen scientists monitoring invasive lionfish populations and to support removal efforts in Bacalar Chico Marine Reserve (BCMR), Belize. Two underwater visual census techniques were trialled with conservation volunteers, each with associated benefits and drawbacks. A log of opportunistic lionfish sightings on SCUBA dives has been used to record sightings per unit effort (SPUE) data 2011-2015. In 2014, more rigorous lionfish focused searches (lionfish-adapted belt transects) were introduced. Opportunistic lionfish sightings contributed to a five year SPUE dataset that suggests that lionfish population growth rate has slowed in BCMR, where a lionfish removal program was also carried out by conservation volunteers over the same timeframe. However, lionfish focused searches showed that the mean density in 2014 was high (mean = 27.05 +/- 8.77 fish ha(-1), 1-30 m) relative to lionfish populations in their native ranges, particularly at sites at depths > 18m (mean = 43.39 +/- 13.76 fish ha(-1), 18-30 m).

Improvements in sensors, sampling platforms, information systems, and collaborations among experts and information users now enables more effective and up-to-date information to meet regional and national needs. Specifically, advances in environmental DNA (eDNA)-based assessments of biodiversity, community science data, various underwater imaging devices, and environmental, behavioral, and physiology observations from animal telemetry provide new opportunities to address multiple requirements for reporting status and trends, including insights into life in the deep ocean. Passive and active acoustic sensors help monitor marine life, boat traffic, and noise pollution. Satellites provide repeated, frequent, and long-term records of many relevant variables from global to local scales and, when combined with numerical computer simulations, allow planning for future scenarios. Metadata standards facilitate the transfer of data from machine to machine, thus streamlining assessments and forecasting and providing knowledge directly to the public.

Preliminary insights into the population characteristics and distribution of reef (Mobula alfredi) and oceanic (M. birostris) manta rays in French Polynesia,"Carpentier, AS; Berthe, C; Ender, I; Jaine, FRA; Mourier, J; Stevens, G; De Rosemont, M; Clua, E","In French Polynesia, both currently recognized manta ray species, Mobula alfredi and M. birostris, are observed. Despite being an important cultural asset and generating significant economic benefits through manta ray watching tourism, published data on the ecology and threats to these species in the region are scarce. Based on an 18-year dataset of sighting records collected by citizen scientists and during two scientific expeditions, this study provides the first insights into the population characteristics and regional distribution of the two manta ray species in French Polynesia. A total of 1347 manta ray photographs (1337 for M. alfredi and 10 for M. birostris) were examined for the period January 2001-December 2017, with photo-identification techniques leading to the successful identification of 317 individual M. alfredi and 10 individual M. birostris throughout the Society, Tuamotu and Marquesas Islands. We provide the first confirmation of sympatric distribution of both species in the Society Islands. Our results highlight strong and long-term site fidelity of M. alfredi individuals to certain aggregation sites (> 9 years for 16 individuals) and reveal some degree of connectivity between populations, with 10 individuals recorded moving between islands located up to 50 km apart. Analysis of photographs of individuals bearing sub-lethal injuries (n = 68) suggests that M. alfredi are more likely to be injured at inhabited islands (Maupiti or Bora Bora; 75% of all injured individuals) than at uninhabited islands, with 75% of injuries related to boat propeller strikes and fishing gear entanglements.

Citizens and satellites: Assessment of phytoplankton dynamics in a NW Mediterranean aquaculture zone,"Busch, JA; Price, I; Jeansou, E; Zielinski, O; van der Woerd, HJ","Ocean colour measurements from space are well suited to assess phytoplankton dynamics over broad spatial scales. Closer to the coast however, the quality of these data degrades as a result of the loading of sediments and dissolved matter from terrestrial runoff, the influences of land reflection on atmospheric correction and sea-bottom reflection, which compromise their use in coastal management actions. Recently, the enabling of citizens to provide environmental observations has gained recognition as a way for enhancing the spatio-temporal coverage of satellite observations. In the FP7 funded EU project ""Citclops"" (Citizens' observatory for coast and ocean optical monitoring), a smart phone app for the classification of water colour, simplified to 21 hues of the Forel Ule (FU) scale, is developed.In this study we examine two bays in the Ebro Delta (NW Mediterranean) where satellite data, hyper spectral measurements, and observations with the citizen tool for colour comparison were available. FU values and their corresponding novel colorimetric parameter, the hue colour angle, were derived in the bay at 12 stations with the traditional FU scale and one automated in-situ radiometric system at the Alfacs Bay aquaculture site. Both methods complied well during the study course of May-June 2011. These measurements were further compared to data from Full Resolution MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) satellite images. The quality of the retrieved hue angle varies over the image. For high-quality sites, MERIS hue colour angles and FU values gave a good estimate of seasonal algal dynamics in the bays over the year 2011, while ground measurements revealed colour changes over short space and time frames, which are indicative of the fast dynamics of phytoplankton in the area that could not be fully resolved with MERIS data.The use of FU values and hue colour angle of water will allow a simple integration of data from hyperspectral measurements, MERIS multispectral observations and citizens observations with the (Citclops/EyeOnWater) water colour app. Such observational data can be included to local monitoring efforts, and can also foster an increased interest of the general public to local environmental management and governance issues.

Who cares about dirty beaches? Evaluating environmental awareness and action on coastal litter in Chile,"Kiessling, T; Salas, S; Mutafoglu, K; Thiel, M","Coastal litter is a source of environmental, economic and health-related problems in many parts of the world, but local responses are not necessarily related to the severity of the impacts. In particular, it is unclear how environmental perception of community members and government bodies relate to active engagement on coastal pollution. The present study analyses the coastal litter situation and evaluates the willingness of citizens to engage at four sites (three regions of mainland Chile, and Easter Island; henceforth Rapa Nui) that feature differences in culture, economy sectors and landscape characteristics. Data on coastal litter were obtained from citizen science campaigns and assessments of large litter accumulations on beaches and rocky shores. The willingness to engage was evaluated qualitatively, considering municipal planning documents and the perception of residents on coastal litter and general waste management. We found very large quantities of litter in northern Chile, posing a hazard to marine wildlife and human health, and moderate quantities in the other regions. The region with the most severe case of coastal pollution does not feature the highest engagement, possibly a result of underlying factors such as an unsustainable economy and few possibilities for the population to connect with the natural environment. On mainland Chile, municipal engagement is low to moderate while on Rapa Nui there exist integrated waste-management strategies that address coastal pollution. Inhabitants of Rapa Nui seem to have a better conduct in the coastal environment (picking up litter, littering less), and show more engagement in waste-reduction strategies (recycling, volunteering for beach clean-ups). We suggest that the unique cultural history of the island, a landscape that allows meaningful interaction with nature and an economy based on sustainable tourism and high international visibility facilitates engagement on environmental issues. We advise managers to consider respective underlying variables, to create environments that allow contact with nature (e.g. public access to parks), and to encourage bottom-up initiatives, preferably by local actors (e.g. by promoting already engaged individuals or organisations).

Comparing monitoring data collected by volunteers and professionals shows that citizen scientists can detect long-term change on coral reefs,"Forrester, G; Baily, P; Conetta, D; Forrester, L; Kintzing, E; Jarecki, L","Citizen science is increasing and can complement the work of professional scientists, but the value of citizen data is often untested. We therefore compared the long-term changes to coral reefs that were detected by a professional and volunteer monitoring program, operated by University of Rhode Island (URI) staff and Reef Check volunteers, respectively. Both groups monitored reefs in the British Virgin Islands from 1997 to 2012 but mostly monitored different sites (URI 8 sites and Reef Check 4 sites). When URI staff visited the Reef Check sites to perform a side-by-side to comparison, Reef Check fish density estimates were consistently higher than those made by URI observers but benthic indicators showed better agreement. When long-term trends were compared, the two programs detected qualitatively similar trends in the % cover of live coral and coral rubble, but temporal changes in the cover of other benthic indicators were less consistent. The URI program detected a widespread increase in parrotfish densities and a decline in snappers, whereas the Reef Check surveys detected no consistent changes in any fish density indicators. Overall, site-specific temporal trends revealed by the URI program were more often statistically significant than those from Reef Check (twice as often for benthic taxa, and five times as often for fish taxa), which implies greater precision of the scientists' counts. Nonetheless, volunteers were able to detect important changes in benthic communities and so have a valuable role to play in assessing change on coral reefs. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Community-based mangrove forest management: Implications for local livelihoods and coastal resource conservation along the Volta estuary catchment area of Ghana,"Aheto, DW; Kankam, S; Okyere, I; Mensah, E; Osman, A; Jonah, FE; Mensah, JC","Even though global interest in mangrove research has increased in recent years, unveiling their immense ecological and economic roles, very little work has been done to investigate the primary driving factors motivating long-term community-based mangrove restoration and management on local scales. In Ghana, policy makers and coastal management practitioners have recently embraced the concept of community-based and co-management of coastal and marine resources. Community-based and co-management approaches require that key stakeholders, most notably the resource users themselves, play significant roles and responsibilities in the management process. However, there is little evaluation of the process in Ghana to assess the success or otherwise, particularly of the few and long standing examples of community-based approaches in coastal resource management. With special reference to an over two decade old community-based mangrove forestry programme along the Volta estuary of Ghana, this paper provides concepts for examination of the ecological and socioeconomic factors influencing mangrove restoration and management by fishers, fish mongers, farmers and their socioeconomic groupings. Participatory GIS mapping and the use of orthophotos generated for the period 1974-2011 provided additional information on temporal evolution of the extent of mangrove areas restored and managed by local stakeholders. Socioeconomic assessment of mangrove products utility was done through questionnaire interviews. The results indicate that livelihoods and economic benefits are the primary factors that motivate local stakeholders' participation in mangrove restoration and management. Mangroves provisioning services, markets and low livelihoods diversification are major drivers of mangrove resources exploitation. The study has shown that mangroves resources can be sustainably exploited, restored and managed if local customary rules are enforced and institutional arrangements put in place to mediate mangrove exploitation and regeneration rates. Such an approach if well developed, could promote coastal resources conservation with high economic returns for the users. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Lack of Cross-Scale Linkages Reduces Robustness of Community-Based Fisheries Management,"Cudney-Bueno, R; Basurto, X","Community-based management and the establishment of marine reserves have been advocated worldwide as means to overcome overexploitation of fisheries. Yet, researchers and managers are divided regarding the effectiveness of these measures. The ""tragedy of the commons'' model is often accepted as a universal paradigm, which assumes that unless managed by the State or privatized, common-pool resources are inevitably overexploited due to conflicts between the self-interest of individuals and the goals of a group as a whole. Under this paradigm, the emergence and maintenance of effective community-based efforts that include cooperative risky decisions as the establishment of marine reserves could not occur. In this paper, we question these assumptions and show that outcomes of commons dilemmas can be complex and scale-dependent. We studied the evolution and effectiveness of a community-based management effort to establish, monitor, and enforce a marine reserve network in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Our findings build on social and ecological research before (1997-2001), during (2002) and after (2003-2004) the establishment of marine reserves, which included participant observation in > 100 fishing trips and meetings, interviews, as well as fishery dependent and independent monitoring. We found that locally crafted and enforced harvesting rules led to a rapid increase in resource abundance. Nevertheless, news about this increase spread quickly at a regional scale, resulting in poaching from outsiders and a subsequent rapid cascading effect on fishing resources and locally-designed rule compliance. We show that cooperation for management of common-pool fisheries, in which marine reserves form a core component of the system, can emerge, evolve rapidly, and be effective at a local scale even in recently organized fisheries. Stakeholder participation in monitoring, where there is a rapid feedback of the systems response, can play a key role in reinforcing cooperation. However, without cross-scale linkages with higher levels of governance, increase of local fishery stocks may attract outsiders who, if not restricted, will overharvest and threaten local governance. Fishers and fishing communities require incentives to maintain their management efforts. Rewarding local effective management with formal cross-scale governance recognition and support can generate these incentives.",2009,,PLOS ONE,4,7,,WOS:000268036000009,10.1371/journal.pone.0006253,,#19687,Cudney-Bueno 2009,,

The historical and social context, flexibility of rule-making, monitoring and enforcement, and how community-based organizations are nested within other organizations is described. A comparison of the degree to which these two frameworks contain 10 key design principles thought to be important for successful commons institutions is presented. Finally, recommendations are made for improving co-management in these countries. A principal finding is that both co-management frameworks were developed for other systems (terrestrial and lakes), which creates misfits for how marine systems can be managed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Effectiveness of village-based marine reserves on reef invertebrates in Emau, Vanuatu","Dumas, P; Jimenez, H; Leopold, M; Petro, G; Jimmy, R","Despite the current expansion of community-based marine conservation initiatives in the Pacific, few studies have specifically addressed their ecological efficiency to restore or enhance reef invertebrate resources. This paper investigated the effects of two very small (< 0.05 km(2)) recent village-based marine reserves (tabu areas) located along the shallow fringing reef of Emau island, Vanuatu. Surveys focused on heavily harvested species (namely trochus, giant clams and green snails) and involved both experienced scientists and local villagers. Abundance, density and individual size data were collected by snorkelling along random transect belts located inside and outside the tabu areas, using simple PVC measuring tools specifically developed for participative monitoring. Habitat was assessed using a photographic method to quantitatively describe varied reef substrata. Resource recovery varied between the areas as a result of species-specific responses to contrasted reserve characteristics and local management practices. Fast-growing mobile Trochus niloticus exhibited strong positive abundance and size responses only within the older larger tabu area through the combined effects of protection from harvesting and translocation actions by local fishers. Similar trends were observed to a lesser extent for sessile slow-growing giant clams (Tridacna spp.), but these were not significant after four years of closure. Despite historical evidence of their presence in the area, surveys emphasized the severe population collapse of the heavily targeted green snail (Turbo marmoratus). Under certain conditions, very small-scale reserves, such as those implemented by village-based conservation initiatives, can rapidly and efficiently enhance local reef invertebrate resources. It is still unclear whether the changes are sufficient to restore critical levels of spawning biomass at larger scale and reverse the severe depletion of invertebrate resources occurring in Vanuatu.",2010,,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,37,3,364-372,WOS:000282494600015,10.1017/S0376892910000536,,#19691,Dumas 2010,,
Using ecosystem service assessments to support participatory marine spatial planning,"Friedrich, LA; Glegg, G; Fletcher, S; Dodds, W; Philippe, M; Bailly, D","With growing interest in ocean uses for sustainable economic development, there is an increasing need for cross-sectoral marine spatial planning to balance different resource uses and conservation requirements. Ecosystem service assessments can provide the evidence to inform marine spatial planning decisions. Existing case studies suggest that these assessments can also have positive effects on the engagement of marine stakeholders in management and planning processes. Stakeholder engagement is a central element in marine spatial planning and other area-based management approaches. However, in a marine context, engagement is often difficult due to the lack of clear boundaries in the ocean, traditionally sectoral marine management and limited understanding of marine ecosystems. The study presented here investigated ecosystem service assessments as a tool for improving marine stakeholder engagement. Stakeholder experiences with ecosystem service assessments in six marine management and planning case studies were analysed to identify why, how and under what conditions ecosystem service assessments can support effective engagement. The findings show that under the right conditions, ecosystem service assessments can provide an inclusive and integrative platform for engagement, enable a better understanding of marine ecosystems, human-ecosystem interactions and management contexts, and support better stakeholder relationships. Stakeholder participation also improves the evidence base for ecosystem service assessments. Thus, involving stakeholders in ecosystem service assessments can improve marine spatial planning decisions and lead to better management and conservation outcomes for the ocean.",2020,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,188,,,WOS:000524370200014,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105121,,#19706,Friedrich 2020,,

This paper analyses the quality of visual estimates of seagrass cover collected by trained volunteers in Moreton Bay (Australia) which has c. 25 000 ha of seagrass habitat. Seagrass was routinely monitored by trained volunteers at 51 sites (50 x 50 m area of intertidal flat) using standardized protocols. Volunteers walked three transects at low tide and assessed the percentage of substrate covered by seagrass within quadrats (50 x 50 cm in area) using photographic guides. Of 33 samples (quadrats) taken at each site, nine (27%) were photographed and later scored by coordinating scientists. The visual estimation of per cent seagrass cover by volunteers was highly correlated with that of scientists and can therefore be used as a reliable source of base-line information about seagrasses in Moreton Bay.

Does monitoring matter?

We examined conservation management interventions resulting from 21/2 years of monitoring by 97 rangers and 350 community volunteers over 1 million hectares of Philippine protected areas. Before this monitoring scheme was established, there was little collaboration between local people and park authorities, and park monitoring was restricted to assessments of the quantity of extracted timber. As a result of the scheme, 156 interventions were undertaken in terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems. In total 98% of these interventions were meaningful and justified, 47% targeted the three most serious threats to biodiversity at the site, and 90% were implemented without external support, suggesting that the interventions were relevant and could be sustained over time at the local level. The mean time from sampling to decision-making was only 97 days, probably because 82% of the interventions were initiated by the same people and institutions that had compiled the underlying data, bypassing potential government bureaucracy. Many of the interventions were jointly undertaken by community members and the management authorities or consisted of local bylaws in support of park management. As a result of the monitoring, indigenous resource use regulation schemes were re- established with government recognition in several parks. The monitoring led to more diversified and realistic management responses on the part of the authorities, including a more socially acceptable and effective approach to enforcement. Of the four field monitoring techniques used, the most participatory one generated more interventions aimed at ensuring a continued resource supply for local communities (X-3(2)= 69.1, p < 0.01).

This paper aims to show evidences that abalone seeds produced in hatcheries can be used to rehabilitate its fisheries in multi-use buffer zones of marine reserves. This study released hatchery-reared abalone juveniles in a community-based resource enhancement site located in multi-use reef surrounding Molocaboc. This island is populated by fisherfolks who participated in protecting the 4000 m(2) coralline release site. Molocaboc Reef comprise the buffer zone of Sagay Marine Reserve in Negros Occidental province in central Philippines.

The stocks recovered in the midst of undisrupted fishing activities in areas immediately outside and beyond the release site.

Piloting participatory smartphone mapping of intertidal fishing grounds and resources in northern Mozambique: Opportunities and future directions,"Paul, SAL; Wilson, AMW; Cachimo, R; Riddell, MA","The participation of local communities in marine resource management can contribute to the sustain ability and longevity of marine resources across diverse coastal settings. In contexts where there are low levels of formal education and high levels of illiteracy, and where marine resource management is governed predominantly by customary management systems, the introduction of formal marine resource management can be challenging. Maps are often required as the basis for spatial marine management measures, effective spatially-explicit fisheries monitoring, and for formal support from fisheries authorities. Our research with local women reef gleaners of Cabo Delgado, in northern Mozambique, pilots the potential uses of smartphones and digital mapping as a tool to allow fishers to map these understudied intertidal fishing grounds, and to understand the ecological dynamics as well as social uses of the intertidal resources. Even though women are key food and income providers through intertidal resource gleaning in this area of Mozambique, they have limited roles in fisheries management decision making. Therefore, we developed a participatory approach to mapping that could act as an entry point for their involvement in the design of a spatial fisheries management plan and associated community monitoring. Fisherwomen were trained to use smartphones with CyberTracker software for mapping intertidal fishing grounds in their village, and the locations of intertidal resources most important to their livelihoods, including octopus, pen shells and oysters. Interviews and focus groups were conducted throughout the mapping process to ascertain women's use and interest in the technology. We conclude that community-based mapping through simple tools as developed in this research can help connect local community groups, bridge traditional and formal governance systems and provide a positive example of co-management in practice.

Human harvesting impacts on managed areas: ecological effects of socially-compatible shellfish reserves,"Aswani, S; Flores, CF; Broitman, BR","We examined how human harvesting impacts on managed areas affect the abundance and size distribution of the edible mangrove shellfish Anadara granosa and Polymesoda spp. in the Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands. We tested two hypotheses: (1) in areas permanently and temporally closed to human exploitation, abundance and size distribution of these shellfish species is significantly greater than in sites open to exploitation and (2) moderate human disturbance of shell beds, particularly of Polymesoda spp., increases their abundance. Firstly, we studied perceptions of environmental states and processes coupled to foraging and management interventions to assess sociocultural influences on harvesting practices and ascertain the types of management regime that people would consider in a context where poaching and interloping are common practices. Secondly, we compared shellfish abundance and shell size from areas that were permanently protected, temporally reserved for communal harvest, and permanently open for exploitation. Thirdly, drawing from women's local knowledge, we measured the abundance of Polymesoda spp. in relation to mud compactness in quadrats across the three management regimes. Results showed that both species were significantly more abundant in permanent and temporally closed sites than in open sites. In the mud compactness study, however, while shell abundance was greater in moderately compacted quadrats, there was no statistical relationship between mud compactness and shell abundance within or across the three management regimes. Results suggest that even under the strong impacts of poaching, temporally closed areas have more clams than open areas and are as effective as areas that are permanently closed nominally. The results also suggest that human harvesting regimes can influence the effectiveness of local management decisions and thus are important when designing community-based conservation programs in the Solomon Islands and other Pacific Islands.",2015,,REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES,25,1,217-230,WOS:000349767000012,10.1007/s11160-014-9376-4,,#19748,Aswani 2015,,
Community and connectivity: summary of a community based monitoring program set up to assess the movement of nutrients and sediments into the Great Barrier Reef during high flow events,"Devlin, M; Waterhouse, J; Brodie, J","The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) system encompasses the largest system of corals and related life forms anywhere in the world. The health of this extensive system, particularly the inshore area, is dependent on the relationship between the GBR and adjacent coastal catchments. The major impact of agricultural practices on the GBR is the degradation of water quality in receiving (rivers) waters, caused by increased inputs of nutrients, suspended sediments and other pollutants. For the past three years, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) has been involved with the cc-ordination of a river-monitoring program, specifically targeting the sampling of rivers during flood events. Representative sites were set up along two North Queensland rivers, the Russell-Mulgrave and Barren Rivers. This monitoring program is run in conjunction with the Queensland Department of Natural Resources' Waterwatch program. The program involves intensive sampling of first flush, extreme flow and post flood conditions over the two rivers. Extreme flow conditions are sampled over a limited time span (48 hours) with trained volunteers at 4-hour intervals. Concentrations measured in the flood events are dependent on landuse characteristic, and extent of flow. Concentrations of dissolved and particulate nutrients are higher if the extreme flow event is part of the first flush cycle. Concentrations of DIN and DIP measured before, during and after a major flood event suggest that there is a large storage of inorganic material within the Barren and Russell-Mulgrave agricultural subcatchments that move over a period of days, and perhaps weeks.

"Co-management approach to marine conservation in Moheli, Comoros Islands","Granek, EF; Brown, MA","Many developing countries experience habitat degradation and unsustainable natural resource exploitation, with biodiversity and habitat conservation efforts often impeded by political instability and limited funding. Challenges in previous conservation efforts coupled with the current rate of marine habitat degradation and species declines warrant consideration of an innovative conservation approach. Co-management of protected areas addresses biological, cultural, economic, and political concerns and empowers communities through collaboration and integration in conservation efforts. It provides flexibility for adaptive practices to address underlying socioeconomic factors affecting conservation efforts and may compensate for limited or missing scientific data. The ecosystems of the Comoros Islands in the West Indian Ocean, a biodiversity hotspot with high endemism and diverse tropical marine habitats, are adversely affected by existing ecological, socioeconomic, and political conditions Moheli Marine Park was designed to address threats to the marine environment and is a model for co-management. We conducted a year-long evaluation of the park implementation process, including community and fisher participation. After 3 years of operation with 80% local community control, the park maintains a small staff to monitor sea turtle nesting beaches, reef health, fisheries, and uninhabited islets and to guide ecotourists and educate visitors. Our analysis revealed successes and shortcomings of the co-management approach. Successes included local communities empowered to participate in natural resource management, increased local involvement in conservation initiatives, and use of traditional knowledge when scientific information was unavailable.

"Evaluation of stakeholder perspectives on the management of the stalked barnacles (Pollicipes pollicipes) resource in the Parque Natural do Sudoeste Alentejano e Costa Vicentina, Portugal","Stewart, ATM; Fragoso, BDD; Climaco, R; Icely, JD","The stalked barnacle, Pollicipes pollicipes, is a shellfish resource which has been traditionally harvested by the coastal communities of the Iberian Peninsula. However, in recent years Pollicipes has attracted increased harvesting pressure due to its high market value. In a national park on the south-western coast of Portugal, legislation was formulated to address the overharvesting of this resource; however, its success has been limited due to lack of consensus among stakeholders. A Systems Approach Framework (SAF) was used to assess the socio-economic and cultural issues surrounding the harvest of Pollicipes. As part of this, interviews and a questionnaire survey were undertaken in the municipality of Vila do Bispo, in order to explore the perspectives of the shell fishers, local residents and restaurateurs. The majority of the stakeholders believed that the resource was overharvested and that their needs should be considered as part of the legislation formulation process. The stakeholders also agreed that the local market should be re-established and that the temporal closure period should be reconsidered. Stakeholder opinions differed with regard to the level of coastal management enforcement required, the licence distribution process and the restrictions implemented by national park authorities. It is concluded that using information such as that gathered from local stakeholders, it should be possible to effectively extend the SAF to simulate scenarios for future management options.

Integrating indigenous ecological knowledge and multi-spectral image classification for marine habitat mapping in Oceania,"Lauer, M; Aswani, S","This paper evaluates the usefulness of integrating indigenous ecological knowledge and remote sensing analyses to produce tropical marine habitat maps. Fishers from Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands, visually interpreted a Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) multi-spectral satellite image to identify shallow-water marine environments. Their assessments were used to direct a supervised classification of the image and create habitat maps with indigenously defined habitat classes. Results show that these participatory remote sensing techniques produce,accurate broad-scale marine habitat maps that can be useful to managers and decision makers. Participatory methods that draw from indigenous habitat definitions also have the potential benefit of generating new insights about socio-ecological processes and enhancing local acceptance and understanding of conservation projects by allowing stakeholders to actively contribute in management planning.

Bringing stakeholders together to articulate multiple value dimensions of ecosystem services,"Lopes, R; Videira, N","Ecosystem services are embedded with multiple values. Capturing and integrating plural perspectives when conducting ecosystem services studies is a recognized need and yet a challenge. This paper proposes a participatory approach that fosters articulation of values allowing the integration of different value dimensions to inform decision-making processes, an important challenge that has been gaining traction in the field of ecosystem services research. Using participation as a value articulating institution, stakeholder groups of the Portuguese marine and coastal Arrabida Natural Park were engaged in a participatory process that included a collaborative workshop to articulate value dimensions expressed by ecological, economic and social criteria in two different contexts: the assessment of project alternatives for regulating access to beaches and recreational activities and a conflict related with allocation of coastal vineyard areas. Results demonstrate that the proposed deliberative process fostered changes in participants' initial mental models and created new insights, namely by generating additional alternatives, expanding perceptions on affected ES, and helping the formalization of multiple evaluation criteria and decision rules, thus supporting decision-making in marine and coastal protected areas.",2018,,OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT,165,,215-224,WOS:000449894500021,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.08.026,,#19854,Lopes 2018,,
Material expertise: An ontological approach to stakeholder participation in marine. policy,"Dixon, ZP","This paper utilizes the work of Bruno Latour to develop an ontology for the development of non-credentialed expertise. In the field of marine policy studies there is a wide body of scholarship advocating the importance of including stakeholder knowledge in the formation of public fishery policies. Despite the many calls for increased stakeholder involvement in fisheries and marine policy development, there remains a relative lack of scholarship that explores how the stakeholder expertise develops and how its quality might be assessed in policy settings. Employing Latour's concepts of material mediation, translation, and inscription to describe the connections between materiality, experience, and expertise this paper offers an ontological explanation of what constitutes non-credentialed expertise. By analyzing the Snook and Gamefish Foundation's deployment of non-credentialed stakeholder expertise in two Florida fisheries management debates from an ontological perspective this paper suggests a materially oriented heuristic for identifying and evaluating stakeholder expertise in marine policy settings.

A Collaborative Approach for Scoping Ecosystem Services with Stakeholders: The Case of Arrabida Natural Park,"Lopes, R; Videira, N","This paper presents an innovative approach for conducting collaborative scoping processes aiming to elicit multiple values of ecosystem services. The proposed methodology rests on three steps combining different participatory tools that promote a comprehensive examination of the perceptions hold by relevant stakeholder groups. The first step consists of an institutional and stakeholder analysis developed in the study area. The second includes a participatory workshop, where a sequence of scoping exercises is conducted with the active collaboration of the invited stakeholders. The final step aims to validate scoping results and develop dependency networks between organizations and the identified ecosystem services. The approach was tested in the Arrabida Natural Park, a marine and coastal protected area in Portugal. Invited participants were able to identify an extensive list of ecosystem services in the natural area, establish linkages between those services and human wellbeing, identify drivers of change and perform a preliminary screening of the associated ecological, social, and economic values.

The use of fishing vessels to provide acoustic data on the distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill and other pelagic species,"Watkins, JL; Reid, K; Ramm, D; Zhao, XY; Cox, M; Skaret, G; Fielding, S; Wang, XL; Niklitschek, E","A fishery for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has existed for over 3 decades and the Commission for Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) manages this fishery using precautionary catch limits, fishery data collection and a scientific observer programme operating on the fishing vessels. A recent increase in the number of vessels fishing and the rising costs of undertaking scientific research cruises have focussed attention on being able to use fishing vessels to collect more extensive scientific data sets. In 2011, CCAMLR's Subgroup on Acoustic Survey and Analysis Methods (SG-ASAM) was tasked with assessing the use of acoustic data collected from fishing vessels to provide qualitative and quantitative information on the distribution and relative abundance of Antarctic krill and other pelagic species. SG-ASAM conceived a proof of concept programme and implemented the first stage in 2013 to determine the current setup of acoustic equipment on participating fishing vessels and to establish whether these vessels could collect geo- and time-referenced acoustic data. To date data have been received from 7 krill fishing vessels and SG-ASAM has now focussed on the development of data collection protocols to enable fishing vessels to collect quantitative acoustic data along prescribed transects. While this development work continues, the willingness of fishing industry to participate in such studies has already been demonstrated by several fishing companies, and Norwegian- and Chinese-flagged fishing vessels are undertaking krill biomass surveys in two key fishery Areas in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean.

"Using Pooled Local Expert Opinions (PLEO) to Discern Patterns in Sightings of Live and Dead Manatees (Trichechus senegalensis, Link 1785) in Lower Sanaga Basin, Cameroon","Mayaka, TB; Kamla, AT; Self-Sullivan, C","We aimed at unveiling patterns in live and dead manatee sightings in the Lower Sanaga Basin, Cameroon. For this purpose, the expert opinions of 133 local fishers were collected during in-person interviews, distilled using categorical data analysis, and checked against scientific literature. The five main results are as follows: manatees were sighted averagely once a week in lakes, rivers, and the coast & estuaries, mostly in group sizes of 2-3; the odds of sighting live manatees (respectively dead manatees) decreased (respectively increased) from inland lakes to estuaries and the coast, via rivers; manatee carcasses were reported in all habitats, albeit more frequently in rivers; a distribution map based on fishers' reports show two manatee concentration areas: Lake Ossa and the Malimba-Mbiako section of River Sanaga; the number of manatees was perceived as increasing despite incidental and directed catches. Thus, our findings corroborate earlier assessments of the Lower Sanaga Basin as being a major manatee conservation area. Additionally, from these results and the literature, we identified three hypotheses about local manatee persistence: deep pools such as lakes offer year round sanctuaries, not just dry-season refugia; seasonality of specific habitat variables determine manatee occurrence patterns; and local variability in habitat encroachment mediate the meta-population dynamics of manatee in the Lower Sanaga Basin. Finally, we examine the implications for data requirements in light of the small ecological scale at which the surveyed fishers ply their trade. Thus, consonant with the Malawi principles for the ecosystem approach to management (www.cbd.int/ecosystem), we recommend collecting data preferably at landscape scale, through a participatory monitoring program that fully integrates scientific and traditional knowledge systems. This program should include, amongst others, a standardised necropsy protocol for collecting mortality and biological data together with sonar and radio-telemetry technology to discern manatee use and movements between critical habitat components.",2015,,PLOS ONE,10,7,,WOS:000358547600003,10.1371/journal.pone.0128579,,#19904,Mayaka 2015,,
"Comparison of local knowledge about the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus Montagu, 1821) in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean: New research needed to develop conservation management strategies","Zappes, CA; Gatts, CEN; Lodi, LF; Simoes-Lopes, PC; Laporta, P; Andriolo, A; Di Beneditto, APM","The aim of this study was to compare the local knowledge of artisanal fishermen about interactions between the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and fisheries in Brazil and Uruguay. Between 2008 and 2011, we performed 88 interviews in Brazil (N = 66) and Uruguay (N = 22). Fuzzy logic was used to identify fishermen who could recognize the bottlenose dolphin. Seventy-nine fishermen (89.8%) identified the bottlenose dolphin, with 40 (50.6%) describing positive interactions, and 21 (34.4%) reporting negative interactions. In Brazil, the local ecological knowledge about the bottlenose dolphin was considered partial but more elaborate, as such knowledge was still incipient in Uruguay. Decreasing the impact of artisanal fishing on coastal populations of bottlenose dolphins in the southwest Atlantic Ocean (SAO) will require the regular monitoring of their areas of use and the locations where gillnets are arranged; consideration the size of the dolphins' populations and the fishing effort in each region; and the participation of social actors through educational activities, particularly in Brazilian areas, and the participation of social actors through educational activities (particularly in Brazilian areas, where the fishermen evinced feelings of competition in relation to the bottlenose dolphin) and improvements in the living and income conditions of these communities. From these results we propose measures for reducing anthropic impacts on bottlenose dolphin populations, including monitoring areas of use and the locations of fishing along the SAO as well as integrated management between social actors - government - research institutes for decisions about fishery management.

Application of participatory principles to investigation of the natural world: An example from Chile,"Schumann, S","Participatory research in environmental and natural resources-related fields is premised on many of the same notions that underlie participatory processes in decision making. This study examines one instance of participatory research to assess the extent to which the documented benefits of participatory decision-making hold up in the context of research. A survey of Chilean shell-fishers engaged in research with marine biologists assesses the relationships between four variables: fishers' participation in research, fishers' opinions of biologists, fishers' trust in biologists, and fishers' acquisition of knowledge from biologists. Results illuminate the multidimensionality of these variables and suggest that complex interrelationships between them make the benefits of participatory research more nuanced than those reported for participatory decision-making. For instance, participatory research may provide low benefits when participatory research outcomes differ little from those produced solely by scientists. In addition, high-cost scenarios may result when outcomes of participatory research are inferior to those produced solely by scientists. A third downside may result when participation leads participants to increase their deference to scientific knowledge, thereby defeating the corroborative purpose of their participation. A fourth effect may occur when increased trust by in scientists results from participation, decreasing participants' perceived need to take part in research. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Trends in sea anglers' catches of trophy fish in relation to stock size,"Richardson, EA; Kaiser, MJ; Edwards-Jones, G; Ramsay, K","Many marine fish stocks worldwide are reported to be in decline and participants in recreational fisheries commonly complain that their catches are declining in size and number as a result. In many fisheries, however, it is difficult to investigate such claims because established data collection programmes are lacking. We sought to investigate perceived and actual trends in anglers' trophy fish catches within a marine recreational fishery, and to investigate whether catches bore any relationship to abundance trends in target stocks. Temporal changes in catches, as perceived by participants in the recreational fishery, were assessed qualitatively using a structured survey. Subsequently we investigated two previously unused sources of sea anglers' trophy fish catch data available for Wales, UK (national angling club and angling magazine reports) and extracted reports for a 27-year period. We assessed species-specific trends in the numbers and sizes of trophy fish reported, and found strong temporal declines in the numbers of trophy thornback ray Raja clavata and cod Gadus morhua reported, as well as a decline in total reported trophy fish. The weight of the heaviest thornback ray reported each year had also declined significantly with time. These trends also were most frequently mentioned by participants in the recreational fishery. Significant declines in cod and thornback ray stocks in the region have been reported, which would explain the reduction in anglers' catches of trophy-sized individuals. As fishing pressure has been shown to reduce the numbers and sizes of individuals in a population we hypothesised that the numbers and sizes of trophy fish caught by anglers would correlate positively with stock abundance. In the absence of stock assessment data we used commercial landings-per-unit-effort (LPUE) figures to give a relative indication of stock abundance trends for the region. However, few correlations of trophy fish catch data with commercial LPUE were found, which is likely attributable to limitations of the LPUE data. Nevertheless, the negative trends in catches of trophy fish by anglers are striking and provide an additional means to monitor gross changes in populations of species vulnerable to over-exploitation.

Institutional Arrangements and Processes in Marine Fishery Reserves-Sanctuaries Establishment in Lagonoy Gulf,"Bradecina, RG; Nieves, P","This paper described the processes and institutional arrangements of MFR-S' establishment in Lagonoy Gulf from period 1993 to 2004. The analysis made use of primary and secondary data mainly derived from key informant interviews and participatory resource assessment (PRA).Results showed that the establishment of Marine Fisheries Reserve-Sanctuary in Lagonoy Gulf started in 1993. During the ten-year period between 1993 and 2004, a total of 8 MFR-S were established with majority in Albay and the least in Camarines Sur. Two categories of institutional arrangements were identified in the gulf, namely: LGU-initiated and community-initiated, commonly facilitated by external agents during the project's incipient stage. Three types of institutional partnership emerged namely: Local Government Unit-Non-Government Organizations/ National Government Agencies (LGU-NGOs/NGAs) and people's organization (PO)-academe partnerships. The institutional arrangement and type of partnership determine the process and mechanism of implementation of MFR-S in Lagonoy Gulf. An academe-facilitated process focuses on research as starting point. NGO-facilitated process starts generally with community organizing, while NGA mostly proceed with policy implementation. The community-academe partnership is strong in the preparatory and planning phase. The LGU-NGO/NGA partnership on the other hand, is strong in the ordinance adoption phase.Some factors could derail or facilitate the development of the establishment process in the logical order, these are: the capability of the LGU, the agenda and the long-term commitment of external agents, The interplay of these hindering and facilitating factors in the establishment process of MFR-S developed a 3-phase logical establishment process model for Lagonoy Gulf consisting of the following phases: (1) preparation and planning; (2) ordinance approval; and (3) implementation and management. This typology evolved two distinct types of mechanism of implementation, namely: (i.) a mechanism where the MFR-S planning preempts the ordinance for its establishment; and (ii.). a mechanism where the MFR-S planning precedes the ordinance for its establishment. The former type of implementation mechanism featured an enactment of ordinance establishing the MFR-S followed by a community consultation and management planning. The scheme resulted to the non-integration of the MFR-S management plan into the ordinance that established it. While the latter type of implementation mechanism featured a community consultation and MFR-S establishment (barangay CRM) followed by the enactment of an ordinance establishing an MFR-S by the municipal government. The scheme resulted to the integration of the MFR-S management plan into the ordinance that established it.A more appropriate and effective MFR-S establishment process could be evolved from the Lagonoy Gulf experience by placing the different institutional arrangements, phase sequence and process typologies at appropriate periods capitalizing on their respective strengths.",2006,,SCIENCE DILIMAN,18,2,47-56,WOS:000217851300005,,,#19987,Bradecina 2006,"Ryan OConnor (2022-07-15 02:52:43)(Select): I dug up the PDF and included it here.

A comparison of perceptions of biological value with scientific assessment of biological importance,"Brown, G; Smith, C; Alessa, L; Kliskey, A","A distinguishing feature of conservation planning and analysis methods is that they generally rely on biological assessments carried out using scientific sampling protocols and methodologies. Few conservation planning methods explicitly include what is variably described as values, understanding and perceptions. In this study, we examine the potential use of local values of biological resources in conservation planning by comparing this with scientific biological assessment of the same region, using the example of Prince William Sound, Alaska (USA). Specifically, we compare the spatial coincidence of local perceptions of biological importance (or value) identified in a survey of Alaska residents with biologically significant areas identified by scientists familiar with the area from a marine conservation workshop. The results indicate a moderate degree of spatial coincidence between local values and scientific assessment with obvious geographic areas of agreement and disagreement. We suggest that incorporation of local perceptions of biological importance can complement and strengthen scientific biological assessments and propose an iterative conservation planning process that includes both methodologies.

Together, academics, surfers and decision makers defined the parameters and criteria for the assessment of surf breaks, developing a set of indicators that drew on both qualitative and quantitative data. These indicators enabled the identification of specific anthropogenic activities affecting surf breaks, their impact on the environment, and actual or possible responses to human activities. DPSIR indicators enabled comparison of states and trends in different surf sites, allowed BTSWSR co-managers to focus on critical issues in need of attention at each surf break, and facilitated the development of specific strategies for an Adaptive Co-management plan at BTSWSR.

Fishers' Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) on Connectivity and Seascape Management,"Berkstrom, C; Papadopoulos, M; Jiddawi, NS; Nordlund, LM","In developing countries where data and resources are lacking, the practical relevance of local ecological knowledge (LEK) to expand our understanding of the environment, has been highlighted. The potential roles of the LEK varies from direct applications such as gathering environmental information to a more participative involvement of the community in the management of resources they depend on. Fishers' LEK could therefore be useful in order to obtain information on how to advance management of coastal fisheries. Many targeted fish species migrate between habitats to feed, spawn or recruit, connecting important habitats within the seascape. LEK could help provide answers to questions related to this connectivity and the identification of fish habitat use, and migrations for species and areas where such knowledge is scarce. Here we assess fishers' LEK on connectivity between multiple habitats within a tropical seascape, investigate the differences in LEK among fisher groups and the coherence between LEK and conventional scientific knowledge (CSK). The study was conducted in 2017 in Zanzibar, Tanzania, a tropical developing country. One hundred and thirty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted in six different locations focusing on fish migrations, and matching photos of fish and habitats. Differences between fisher groups were found, where fishers traveling further, exposed to multiple habitats, and who fish with multiple gears had a greater knowledge of connectivity patterns within the seascape than those that fish locally, in single habitats and with just one type of gear. A high degree of overlap in LEK and CSK was found, highlighting the potential benefits of a collaboration between scientists and fishers, and the use of LEK as complementary information in the management of small-scale fisheries.",2019,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,6,,,WOS:000462731300003,10.3389/fmars.2019.00130,,#20078,Berkstrom 2019,,

Residents of the Wakatobi National Park (WNP), SE Sulawesi, Indonesia are highly dependent on marine resources for livelihoods and correspondingly LEK is high. Here LEK documents the presence of D. dugon in the WNP and infers changes in population size.

Indigenous and local peoples' values of estuarine shellfisheries: moving towards holistic-based catchment management,"Kainamu-Murchie, AA; Marsden, ID; Tau, RTM; Gaw, S; Pirker, J","Estuaries support a wide range of human activities and values, but are one of the most anthropogenically impacted ecosystems in the world. Ki uta ki tai is a holistic view of waterways that is embodied within Ngi Tahu environmental management, which acknowledges the connectivity between environmental systems and people with the environment. While this philosophy is referred to within current policies, management does not effectively account for or reflect this philosophy. This research evaluated indigenous and local socio-cultural values provided by estuarine shellfisheries across Waitaha/Canterbury and found Ngi Tahu place-based interaction was impacted by management and anthropogenic inputs. Participants' estuarine stressors aligned with global stressors. Experienced harvesters/fishers adapted their practices to these stressors, while less experienced harvesters/fishers visited high food-risk sites.

When conducting studies on ecosystem services valuation and assessment, the interdependencies and feedback structures underpinning ecosystem functioning should be identified and explicitly considered in management processes, especially when the goal is to pursue a plural and integrative approach that accounts for multiple values. This paper explores the role of a participatory system dynamics modelling approach - participatory systems mapping - as a tool to articulate different value dimensions of ecosystem services. The application of the tool is illustrated with a case study conducted in a protected area in Portugal, wherein inter-organisational stakeholder groups collaborated in the conceptualization of feedback processes characterizing ecosystem services during a group modelling workshop. The outcomes of the participatory workshop were submitted to a post-production process and returned to participants though an individual online survey aiming to validate the changes. Food production, recreation and ecotourism, biodiversity conservation and climate regulation were the ecosystem services explored. Results show that by accommodating the co-creation of causal system maps with stakeholders, the proposed approach fosters sharing of insights on the underlying cause-effect mechanisms and leverage points, supporting the identification of interrelationships between different ecosystem services and the selection of key indicators for management processes.

Traditional populations in environmentally protected areas: an ethnobotanical study in the Soure Marine Extractive Reserve of Brazil,"Rocha, TT; Tavares-Martins, ACC; Lucas, FCA","In the Amazon, there are significant numbers of indigenous and non-indigenous populations who depend on natural resources for their subsistence. The objective of this study was to conduct an ethnobotanical inventory in three communities (Comunidade do Caju-Una; Povoado do Cu; and Vila do Pesqueiro) within the Soure Marine Extractive Reserve, located in the Archipelago of Marajo, in the state of Para, Brazil. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and participant observation. We performed the sampling using nonprobabilistic methods and feature selection. In a quantitative analysis, we evaluated the following indices: total species diversity; informant diversity of a species; use value of a species; consensus use value of a species; and use equitability value of a species. Of the 215 ethnobotanical species listed for the Soure Marine Extractive Reserve, 79 were cited as useful by respondents. We identified nine use categories, of which medicinal use was the most often cited. The indices calculated showed that the level of species diversity is high in the Soure Marine Extractive Reserve.

Industry-based acoustic survey of Atlantic herring distribution and spawning dynamics in coastal Maine waters,"Wurtzell, KV; Baukus, A; Brown, CJ; Jech, JM; Pershing, AJ; Sherwood, GD","We describe a unique survey method that is able to cover a wide spatial and temporal range at a low cost. We utilised 10 individual small fishing vessels (lobster vessels) as acoustic research platforms to systematically survey a coastal population of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) in the Gulf of Maine. We examined 38 transects spanning more than 200 miles of coastline. Due to the low cost of chartering the vessels, the survey was repeated weekly for nine weeks, resulting in over 2300 nautical miles of on-transect data. We calibrated single beam systems using a split beam guiding transducer to increase our confidence in the accuracy of the data and allow inter-ship comparisons. Although only one year of data has been analysed, the large spatial and temporal coverage of this survey provides preliminary information on herring population dynamics including spatial distribution throughout the survey area, timing of spawning and habitat associations of spawning aggregations. This survey will provide the template for longer term monitoring of herring spawning dynamics in Coastal Maine and how this may respond to climate and ocean variability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Meeting the giants: The need for local ecological knowledge (LEK) as a tool for the participative management of manatees on Marajo Island, Brazilian Amazonian coast","Sousa, MEM; Martins, BML; Fernandes, MEB","Local ecological knowledge (LEK) has been widely used as a source of reliable information for the development of research on the ecology of manatees. Based on this approach, the present study evaluated the level of knowledge related to manatees among the local fishermen on the east coast of Marajo Island on the Brazilian Amazonian coast, which represents a zone of sympatry and hybridization between marine and Amazon species of manatees. Most of the interviewees (70%) displayed a high level of knowledge with regard to these mammals, and provided reliable information for mapping of the occurrence of the manatees within the study area, including identifying the habitats and areas that are most appropriate for their occurrence (based on their eating habits, preferred areas and records of sightings). The challenges faced by fishers as well as knowledge of other issues related to the challenges present in the Amazon region demonstrate the relevance of the data presented in this study. Furthermore, our findings reinforce the value of such information provided by fishermen, and demonstrate how it can be associated with scientific knowledge as an effective tool for the participatory management of manatees along the Brazilian Amazonian coast.

Observer bias and detection probability in underwater visual census of fish assemblages measured with independent double-observers,"Bernard, ATF; Gotz, A; Kerwath, SE; Wilke, CG","Underwater visual census (UVC) is one of the more frequently used methods for monitoring of subtidal fish communities. However, population estimates from UVC are plagued by numerous biases that ultimately reduce the diagnostic power of the data. Adaptations to methods that account for detection errors by employing multiple observers can reduce many of these biases, but have received little consideration in past marine research. In the terrestrial environment the double-observer method has been successfully applied to estimate visibility bias, observer bias and detection probabilities. We used an independent double-observer method to measure the influence of observer type (volunteers and researchers) and fish community structure on the detection probability and count dissimilarity between two observers simultaneously surveying the same transect. Community data collected by volunteers were of a consistently lower quality than that collected by researchers. However, this was not the case for the dominant species for which researchers and volunteers produced similar data. The analysis further suggested that rare species contributed disproportionately to the bias in UVC data because the abundance of a species within a survey area determined its detection probability. Our results highlight the need to account for detection probability during UVC and it is recommended that future research based on UVC integrates an independent double-observer approach. Furthermore, the results indicate that care needs to be taken when designing monitoring programmes as allowing inexperienced volunteers to participate can undermine the integrity of the data.

A review of the Oceanographic Research Institute's Cooperative Fish Tagging Project: 27 years down the line,"Dunlop, SW; Mann, BQ; van der Elst, RP","The Oceanographic Research Institute's (ORI) Cooperative Fish Tagging Project was initiated in 1984 and is one of the most enduring and successful environmental projects of its kind in South Africa. By the end of 2011, 5 130 anglers had joined the project, of whom 3 457 had tagged one or more fish. In the project's 27-year history (1984-2011), over 251 900 fish from 368 different species have been tagged and released, of which approximately 13 192 (5.2%) have been recaptured. The five most commonly tagged species to date are galjoen Dichistius capensis, dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus, dusky shark Carcharhinus obscurus, garrick/leervis Lichia amia and spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii. Information from the Tagging Project has been extensively used in numerous research projects, scientific publications, popular articles and postgraduate theses. The results generated by this project have also contributed to policy development and decision-making on linefish management in South Africa. Furthermore, the project has had a positive impact on improving angler awareness and knowledge about linefish resources. The concept of tag and release has partly been responsible for changing the ethics of the recreational fishing community, many of whom now release their catch, thereby contributing to a more sustainable fishing future. This paper critically assesses the contribution that the ORI Tagging Project has made as a conservation achievement in general and to linefish management in particular, and reflects on future directions for the project.",2013,,AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE,35,2,209-221,WOS:000323002600008,10.2989/1814232X.2013.769909,,#20290,Dunlop 2013,,REVIEW ARTICLE; missing
Seagrass-Watch: Engaging Torres Strait Islanders in marine habitat monitoring,"Mellors, JE; McKenzie, LJ; Coles, RG","Involvement in scientifically structured habitat monitoring is a relatively new concept to the peoples of Torres Strait. The approach we used was to focus on awareness, and to build the capacity of groups to participate using Seagrass-Watch as the vehicle to provide education and training in monitoring marine ecosystems. The project successfully delivered quality scientifically rigorous baseline information on the seasonality of seagrasses in the Torres Strait-a first for this region.Eight seagrass species were identified across the monitoring sites. Seagrass cover varied within and between years. Preliminary evidence indicated that drivers for seagrass variability were climate related. Generally, seagrass abundance increased during the north-west monsoon (Kuki), possibly a consequence of elevated nutrients, lower tidal exposure times, less wind, and higher air temperatures. Low seagrass abundance coincided with the presence of greater winds and longer periods of exposure at low tides during the south-east trade wind season (Sager). No seasonal patterns were apparent when frequency of disturbance from high sedimentation and human impacts was high.Seagrass-Watch has been incorporated in to the Thursday Island High School's Marine Studies Unit ensuring continuity of monitoring. The students, teachers, and other interested individuals involved in Seagrass-Watch have mastered the necessary scientific procedures to monitor seagrass meadows, and developed skills in coordinating a monitoring program and skills in mentoring younger students. This has increased the participants' self-esteem and confidence, and given them an insight into how they may participate in the future management of their sea country.

"Robust, comparable population metrics through collaborative photo-monitoring of whale sharks Rhincodon Typus","Holmberg, J; Norman, B; Arzoumanian, Z","The formulation of conservation policy for species that are rare and migratory requires broad cooperation to ensure that adequate levels of standardized data collection are achieved and that the results of local analyses are comparable. Estimates of apparent survival rate; relative change in abundance, and proportions of newly marked and returning individuals can inform local management decisions while highlighting corresponding changes at other linked research stations. We have applied computer-assisted photo-identification and mark-recapture population modeling to whale Sharks Rhincodon typus at Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP), Western Australia, to create a baseline trend for comparison with other regional aggregations of the species. We estimate several ecological parameters of interest, including an average apparent survival rate of 0.55 yr(-1) for sharks newly marked (new) and 0.83 yr(-1) for sharks captured in multiple seasons (philopatric). The average proportion of philopatric sharks is found to be 0.65 of the total population, and we derive an average population growth rate of 1.12 yr(-1) for them. Our analysis uncovered significant heterogeneity in capture and survival probabilities in this study population; our chosen model structures and data analysis account for these influences and demonstrate a good overall fit to the time-series data. The results show good correspondence between capture probability and an available measure of recapture effort, suggesting that unmodeled systematic effects contribute insignificantly to the model fits. We find no evidence of a decline in the whale shark population at NMP, and our results provide metrics of value to their future management. Overall, our study suggests an effective approach to analyzing and modeling mark-recapture data for a rare species using computer-assisted photo-identification and opportunistic data collection from ecotourism to ensure the quality and volume of data required for population analysis.",2008,,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,18,1,222-233,WOS:000253371800018,10.1890/07-0315.1,,#20388,Holmberg 2008,,

Each of the collaborative management areas has its own collaborative management area plan (CMAP), which is jointly implemented by the communities and the District Council. The joint management efforts include the closure of reefs for replenishment, enforcement and monitoring. Monitoring of the impact of the management interventions is carried out by a reef monitoring team comprised of villagers, and is co-ordinated by district staff.

Monitoring of fish and fish catches by local fishermen in Kenya and Tanzania,"Obura, DO; Wells, S; Church, J; Horrill, C","Monitoring of fish populations underwater and of fish catches is being undertaken at several sites in Kenya and Tanzania using local names and languages. This paper describes the programmes underway at Kiunga Marine Reserve and Diani-Chale in Kenya, and at Tanga in Tanzania. At all three sites, standard protocols have been adapted for use by local fishermen, who have been trained to collect data. A key factor enabling this has been to use local knowledge as the foundation of monitoring. The paper discusses some of the difficulties encountered, such as variations in the use of names, and generally low literacy among fishermen. Overall, the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages in terms of developing a much greater sense of involvement in, and participation by, the fishing communities in the management of their resources.

Citizen Scientists Record Significant Range Extensions for Tropical Sea Slug Species in Subtropical Eastern Australia,"Smith, S.D.A.; Nimbs, M.J.","The Sea Slug Census program in Australia engages with citizen scientists to record the diversity and distribution of sea slugs across multiple locations. The program has consistently recorded shifts in distribution patterns but a recent, nine-day census in subtropical eastern Australia recorded unprecedented range extensions of tropical species. Seven species (six chromodorids and one polycerid) were found further south of their previously known distribution with Hypselodoris bertschi being recorded for the first time in Australia. These observations suggested the recent transport of larvae via the East Australian Current with recruitment to coastal sites possibly promoted by a protracted period of strong onshore winds associated with the 2021/22 La Niña in the western Pacific. With the increasing frequency of poleward range extensions of marine taxa, citizen science programs such as the Sea Slug Census provide the opportunity to substantially increase monitoring efforts.

Integrating fishermen’s perception: A key success for the projected Marine Protected Area “ Jabal Moussa”,"Derdabi, M.R.; Aksissou, M.; Triplet, P.","Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been created all over the world to preserve biodiversity and manage human activities such as fishing and tourism. Even though they are a result of human decision-making processes aiming to change human behavior, many MPAs have neglected the human dimension and therefore failed to accomplish their goals. Thus, taking into account local community perceptions would undoubtedly contribute to MPAs success and durability. This paper has been focused on assessing fishermen‟s perception of the projected marine protected area “Jabal Moussa” situated in northern Morocco and overlooking the strait of Gibraltar. The survey was conducted with 99 fishermen in the three fishing sites of this area. Results showed reluctance towards the idea of implementing a MPA. The majority of fishermen illustrated that the implementation of this MPA would lead to a decrease in catches and an increase in costs and charges if some fishing grounds were closed. Compensatory measurements would be an alternative to this loss. Fishermen affirmed that the projected MPA should be managed conjointly with local cooperatives and associations according to a co-management approach to reach its goals. This approach could avoid conflicts likely to occur during the creation and post-creation of the future MPA. For the success of the projected MPA, authorities/fishermen meetings should be organized to discuss the fears, benefits, incentives, expectations, mode of governance, zonation, etc… In this context, it is possible to move towards better management of the MPA, balancing the conservation of the marine ecosystem and the well-being of fishermen. © 2022, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

It was recorded in May 2014 at the Pina Reef, 2.28 miles off Kas harbour (southwestern coasts of Turkey) for the first time, and showed a very rapid establishment in the rocky habitats throughout Kas-Kekova Special Environmental Protected Area (SEPA). During the summer of 2014 only three individuals were recorded at two different locations, however as of 2017, regular observations could be made at each diving spot, which is indicative of an increasing trend. The temporal perspective of this study increases the understanding on the progression of expected range expansion of P. miles within a relatively small region, covering the period of 2014–2019. Fish count observations from underwater visual census surveys in addition to records from citizen science approach were evaluated based on spatio-temporal analysis. Resulting visualizations were prepared to present annual dynamics of spatio-temporal distribution within and outside the SEPA. Rapid expansion, up to 22 individuals per 500 m linear transects of an estimated area of 15.000 m2 each, and the increases in the numbers of fish are quantified in this study, which can be used as a baseline to develop conservation strategy for native species.

Population trends of beach-spawning California grunion Leuresthes tenuis monitored by citizen scientists,"Martin, K.L.M.; Pierce, E.A.; Quach, V.V.; Studer, M.","California Grunion Leuresthes tenuis (Atherinopsidae), an indigenous endemic marine fish, makes spectacular midnight spawning runs onto sandy beaches on the Pacific coast of California and Baja California. In a unique recreational fishery, people capture the fish out of water with bare hands. Grunion hunters are not required to report their catch, and there is no bag limit. California Grunion rarely appear in trawls and do not take a hook, so population status for this species is impossible to obtain by traditional fishery methods. With citizen scientists, the “Grunion Greeters,” we monitored spawning runs along most of their habitat range. California Grunion recently underwent a northward range extension, but runs appear to be declining broadly across the core habitat. Noisy activities of recreational grunion hunters on shore disrupt spawning runs, preventing fish from reproducing before capture. Leuresthes tenuis has been identified as a Key Indicator Species for the South and Central regions of California Marine Protected Areas, and as an indicator species for climate change on beaches. Gear restrictions, license requirements, and a two-month closed season are rarely enforced late at night.

Beauty and the reef: Evaluating the use of non-expert ratings for monitoring aesthetic values of coral reefs,"Pert, P.L.; Thiault, L.; Curnock, M.I.; Becken, S.; Claudet, J.","Aesthetic values are a key driver of tourist and recreational visitation to natural areas and are listed among the selection criteria for World Heritage properties. However, assessment and monitoring of aesthetic values in natural areas, and coral reefs in particular, have proven to be challenging. In our study we explored the value and limitations of a rapid assessment approach involving non-expert ratings of aesthetic beauty as a potential tool for long-term monitoring of aesthetic values in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, Australia. We investigated the sensitivity of a rating scale for detecting change and sampling requirements for monitoring, as well as observer biases, using an online survey of 1417 Australians in which respondents rated the aesthetic beauty of 181 coral reef images on a ten-point scale. Our results show average aesthetic rating scores ranged from 4.35 to 8.34 on a scale from 1 (ugly) to 10 (beautiful), with potential to detect differences of statistical significance within one point, indicating sufficient sensitivity to change for monitoring purposes. We found that a sample size of c.100 ratings per image provided a reasonable balance between cost (i.e. sample size) and accuracy (i.e. error). Older respondents (>65 years) with higher levels of coral reef visitation, experience and interest were more likely to give extreme ratings, however, there was no apparent predictor for this bias to be positive or negative (high or low ratings). Based on these results we provide recommendations to assist coral reef managers in their use and interpretation of non-expert aesthetic ratings in coral reef monitoring. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,,Science of the Total Environment,730,,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139156,,#20614,Pert 2020,,
Investigating the distribution and regional occurrence of anthropogenic litter in English marine protected areas using 25 years of citizen-science beach clean data,"Nelms, S.E.; Eyles, L.; Godley, B.J.; Richardson, P.B.; Selley, H.; Solandt, J.-L.; Witt, M.J.","Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are designated to enable the management of damaging activities within a discrete spatial area, and can be effective at reducing the associated impacts, including habitat loss and over-exploitation. Such sites, however, may be exposed to the potential impacts from broader scale pressures, such as anthropogenic litter, due to its diffuse nature and lack of constraint by legislative and/or political boundaries. Plastic, a large component of litter, is of particular concern, due to increasing evidence of its potential to cause ecological and socio-economic damage. The presence of sensitive marine features may mean that some MPAs are at greater potential risk from the impacts of plastic pollution than some non-protected sites. Understanding the abundance, distribution and composition of litter along coastlines is important for designing and implementing effective management strategies. Gathering such data, however, can be expensive and time-consuming but litter survey programmes that enlist citizen scientists are often able to resolve many of the logistical or financial constraints. Here, we examine data collected over 25-years (1994–2018), by Marine Conservation Society volunteers, for spatial patterns in relation to the English MPA network, with the aim of highlighting key sources of litter and identifying management priority areas. We found that MPAs in southeast (Kent) and southwest (Cornwall and Devon) England have the highest densities of shore-based litter. Plastic is the main material constituent and public littering the most common identifiable source. Items attributed to fishing activities were most prevalent in southwest MPAs and sewage related debris was highest in MPAs near large rivers and estuaries, indicating localised accumulation. When comparing inside and outside of MPAs, we found no difference in litter density, demonstrating the need for wider policy intervention at local, national and international scales to reduce the amount of litter. © 2020",2020,,Environmental Pollution,263,,,,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114365,,#20618,Nelms 2020,,

Have you seen the dolphins? Dolphin watching participatory monitoring in a brazilian multiple-use marine protected area,"Macedo, H.S.; Flores, P.A.C.; Steenbock, W.; Medeiros, R.P.","The Environmental Protected Area of Anhatomirim (EPAA) located in the Southern coast of Brazil, at Santa Catarina State, is a multiple-use Marine Protected Area (MPA), established to protect the southernmost population of the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) and its habitats. Boat tourism is an important marine activity, carrying annually around 150,000 tourists, turning the EPAA into the most visited place to cetacean watch in South America. We describe the experience of managing boat tourism, highlighting the deployment of the Dolphin Monitoring Program. We discuss its strengths and limitations, considering the data from the participatory monitoring conducted since 2014, and from interviews made with all the boat owners. Our results indicate the conflicts among the main stakeholders were reduced, and the monitoring program was able to provide important short-term and intense time-series information on the dolphins’ location and on the boat tourism activity previously unavailable. Notwithstanding, a series of constraints remain, and among others we indicate the need to go beyond the current focus on the commercial benefits of the activity and to combine the participatory monitoring data with those from scientific survey cruises. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial and temporal settlement patterns of blue crab (Callinectes sapidus and Callinectes similis) megalopae in a drought-prone Texas estuary,"Weatherall, T.F.; Scheef, L.P.; Buskey, E.J.","The Mission-Aransas Estuary is the wintering ground for the only sustained wild population of the endangered whooping crane (Grus americana), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) are an important component of their diet as well as being a major food source for important sport fishes such as the red and black drum. Blue crabs also support a commercial crabbing industry, and fisheries data indicate that blue crab populations have been declining since the 1980s. Possible factors leading to decline in blue crab populations include overfishing, increased populations and predation by regulated sport fishes, reduced freshwater inflows into estuaries, and reduced larval recruitment. Little is known about blue crab recruitment dynamics in this region, but restricted passes between coastal estuaries and the Gulf of Mexico along with extended periods of drought that often lead to hypersaline conditions in coastal bays may limit larval recruitment from the Gulf into the bays. To investigate blue crab larval recruitment patterns, citizen scientist volunteers used hogshair settlement collectors to sample five monitoring sites over a four year period. Results show that large numbers of blue crab megalopae are common in nearshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, but only a small fraction (∼1%) recruit into the estuary. Peak periods of ingress into the estuary occur during fall and winter months, with C. sapidus primarily contributing to the fall peak and C. similis dominating the winter peak. Increased salinity in the estuary during droughts may reduce the ability of blue crab larvae to detect and enter passes into the estuary. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science",214,,89-97,,10.1016/j.ecss.2018.09.017,,#20694,Weatherall 2018,,
A mass-balanced food web model for a kelp forest ecosystem near its southern distributional limit in the northern hemisphere,"Vilalta-Navas, A.; Beas-Luna, R.; Calderon-Aguilera, L.E.; Ladah, L.; Micheli, F.; Christensen, V.; Torre, J.","Coastal ecosystems are influenced by a suite of drivers and interactions, resulting in complex dynamics not captured by single species, single driver approaches. Kelp forest ecosystems of the California Current region are subject to extreme environmental variability as well as a suite of fishing pressures which remove organisms throughout the food web. Here, we present a food-web model to assess ecosystem-wide effects of different fishing strategies which can also be used to estimate the effect of warming, acidification and hypoxia on the structure and function of a highly productive temperate ecosystems. We built a mass-balanced model of a kelp forest ecosystem near the southern limit of distribution in the northern hemisphere (Isla Natividad, Mexico). The model is informed by extensive ecological monitoring of fish, benthic invertebrates, and macroalgae conducted annually from 2006 to 2016 at 5 sites around the island. The model includes 40 functional groups (FG) defined on the basis of commercial interest, ecosystem function and feeding guild, including birds, marine mammals, fish (13 FG), commercial species (7 FG), macroinvertebrates (8 FG), zooplankton, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, six macroalgae, phytoplankton and detritus. The estimated throughput was 5477.6 t·km−2·year−1 (26% consumption, 27% exports, 24% respiration and 23.7% detritus). The sum of all production was 2727.9 t·km2·year−1, and the total primary production/total respiration ratio was 2.4. This model, based on a detailed, multi-year monitoring program in the kelp forests, provides a valuable tool for exploring drivers of change in these vulnerable marine ecosystems and fisheries. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2018,,Food Webs,17,,,,10.1016/j.fooweb.2018.e00091,,#20700,Vilalta-Navas 2018,,
"Citizen science: a successful tool for monitoring invasive alien species (IAS) in Marine Protected Areas. The case study of the Egadi Islands MPA (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy)","Mannino, A.M.; Balistreri, P.","The chief purpose of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is biodiversity conservation. The effects that invasive alien species (IAS) have on MPAs, and vice versa, are not yet fully known, even though assessing them is crucial for MPA planning. Management plans require sound knowledge of the pathways of introduction, the impact and current distribution of IAS. Monitoring plans are essential for preventing and reducing the risk of IAS introduction. In this respect, the involvement of citizen scientists in gathering data (validated by taxonomic experts) on the occurrence of IAS, that would otherwise be impossible to collect, may be crucial. We report on our experience of citizen science in the Egadi Islands MPA with the project ‘Caulerpa cylindracea–Egadi Islands’, aimed at monitoring the spread dynamics of the ‘sea grape’ C. cylindracea. The project registered 156 sightings and also allowed collection of records and information concerning other non-indigenous and cryptogenic species, e.g. the spotted sea hare (Aplysia dactylomela), the harpoon weed (Asparagopsis armata), the red sea plume (Asparagopsis taxiformis), the tube-building sabellid (Branchiomma bairdi), the blue spotted cornet fish (Fistularia commersoni) and the nomad jellyfish (Rhopilema nomadica). © 2018, © 2018 Biodiversity Conservancy International.",2018,,Biodiversity,19,2-Jan,42-48,,10.1080/14888386.2018.1468280,,#20726,Mannino 2018,,missing
Diet of Norwegian coastal cod (Gadus morhua) studied by using citizen science,"Enoksen, S.E.; Reiss, H.","The Norwegian coastal cod (Gadus morhua) is a keystone species in the food web of northern Norwegian fjords. Their relatively stationary populations might specifically depend on local food resources, but the diet of cod has rarely been studied in fjord systems. Using a citizen science approach, where recreational anglers and tourists participated in the sampling, we studied small-scale differences in the diet composition of cod in a fjord system in northern Norway. We compared the cod diet from the MPA Saltstraumen, characterised by strong tidal currents and a highly diverse and abundant fauna, with the inner fjord area of Skjerstadfjord. The diet composition of cod significantly differed between both areas within the fjord. Although fish was the dominant prey in both areas, cod consumed > 40% invertebrates in terms of weight, even in the cod size class of 70–99 cm. The invertebrate prey also caused the observed spatial differences. In Saltstraumen, brittle stars (Ophiuroidea), crabs (Brachyura) and sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea) were important food sources for cod, while sea urchins (Echinoidea), clams (Bivalvia), shrimps (Caridea) and krill (Euphausiacea) dominated the diet in the inner Skjerstadfjord. The high densities of sessile fauna in the dynamic environment of Saltstraumen, was only partly reflected in the diet of cod, with only Holothuroidea found in 17% of the stomachs. High rates of empty stomachs (24%), cannibalism as well as a higher proportion of low-energy prey in the diet of large cod, may indicate a shortage of high quality food in Skjerstadfjord. The samples for this study were collected through a citizen science campaign. This approach might provide opportunities to be used for coastal ecological monitoring with potential applications in local ecosystem management strategies through public involvement. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2018,,Journal of Marine Systems,180,,246-254,,10.1016/j.jmarsys.2017.06.006,,#20730,Enoksen 2018,,
"Marine spatial utilization by local fisherman in west kei kecil small islands park, maluku province, Indonesia","Makailipessy, M.M.; Thenu, I.M.; Abrahamsz, J.","Spatial information on fishing such as fishing grounds of local fishermen contributes to the preparation and evaluation of zoning of a marine conservation area. This information is also useful in reducing the potential for space conflicts. The purpose of this study is to analyze the use of sea space by local fishermen based on fishing gear and fishing ground, as well as evaluation of suitability of fishing ground with zonation system in the conservation area of Kei Kecil Island. The research was conducted in May to August 2017, in 3 fishermen ohoi (village), Matwaer, Somlain and Ohoidertutu. Data collection uses interview techniques and participatory mapping. Data is processed and analyzed based on geographic information system (GIS). The results show the utilization of marine space based on the distribution of fishing gear which is dominated by gill net and lines. The use of marine space based on fishing ground, varies seasonally. Local fishermen categorize seasonally fishing ground based on the distribution of fish catches, include: high season from September to December, middle season from May to August, and low season from January to April. There are three types of fishing ground based on the intensity of space use, covering primary, secondary and tertiary fishing ground. Tertiary fishing grounds have wider space use patterns than other types of fishing ground. In the famine season, fishermen tend to enter core zones, sub-zones of tourism and aquaculture for fishing purposes, means that local fishermen have violated the zonation system on TPK Kei Kecil Island. © 2018, BIOFLUX SRL.

"Reassessment of a Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network Site: Kachemak Bay, Alaska","Matz, G.; Lanctot, R.B.; West, G.C.; Michaud, M.","Two portions of Kachemak Bay, Mud Bay and Mariner Park on the Homer Spit and the Fox River Flats, Alaska, are recognized collectively as a site of International Importance for shorebirds within the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHRSN). These sites were designated based on observations collected between the 1970s and 1990s that indicated more than 100,000 shorebirds stopped at the sites each spring during their northbound migration. As part of an effort to assess shorebird use of this area, the Kachemak Bay Birders (KBB), a volunteer citizen-science organization, conducted ground surveys along Homer Spit and nearby waters between 2009 and 2011. They also conducted a series of aerial surveys along the Kachemak Bay coastline in 2010. After restricting data to areas and time periods comparable to historic data, we found the average number of birds observed from the ground on the Homer Spit was down by one-third compared to previous counts (18,436 prior to 1995 versus 7,055 observed between 2009 and 2011). Most of this change was due to a drop in the number of Western Sandpipers Calidris mauri, the most numerous shorebird species observed. Numbers of other species fluctuated from year to year but not as much, and the overall species composition remained the same although several new species were observed in low numbers. Contemporary aerial surveys indicated a large qualitative decline in the number of birds on the Fox River Flats relative to aerial surveys conducted during the 1970s-1990s. We discuss the possibilities that these changes represent a temporary decline, a decrease in the use of the area, a reduction in population size of the more common species, or just an artifact of changing methodologies. We also discuss issues to consider when reassessing a WHSRN (or other) designation should contemporary surveys show its declining importance to birds. Finally, we advocate for a broader-based survey within Cook Inlet and along the Pacific Flyway to better understand the trends observed at Kachemak Bay.",2012,,Wader Study Group Bulletin,119,1,16-Sep,,,,#20991,Matz 2012,,
Inferring the location and scale of mixing between habitat areas of lesser sandeel through information from the fishery,"Jensen, H.; Rindorf, A.; Wright, P.J.; Mosegaard, H.","Sandeels are small pelagic fish that play an important role in the diet of a range of natural predators. Because of their limited capture by traditional survey gear, little is known about their large-scale distribution or the degree of mixing between habitat areas. Detailed information collected directly from the fishery was used to map fishing grounds, which were then assumed to reflect the foraging habitat of the species. Length distributions from individual hauls were used to assess differences in the distributions as a function of distance between samples. Sandeel foraging habitat covered some 5% of the total area of the North Sea. Mixing between neighbouring fishing grounds was too low to eliminate differences in length distributions at distances between grounds down to 5 km. Within fishing grounds, mixing was sufficient to eliminate differences in length distributions at scales <28 km but insufficient at greater distances. The lack of mixing between grounds may result in large differences in sandeel abundance among adjacent fishing grounds. Further, notable abundance at one end of an extensive fishing ground is not necessarily indicative of similar abundance at its other end. © 2010 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Unite research with what citizens do for fun: Recreational monitoring of marine biodiversity,"Goffredo, S.; Pensa, F.; Neri, P.; Orlandi, A.; Gagliardi, M.S.; Velardi, A.; Piccinetti, C.; Zaccanti, F.","Institutes often lack funds and manpower to perform large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Citizens can be involved, contributing to the collection of data, thus decreasing costs. Underwater research requires specialist skills and SCUBA certification, and it can be difficult to involve volunteers. The aim of this study was to involve large numbers of recreational divers in marine biodiversity monitoring for increasing the environmental education of the public and collecting data on the status of marine biodiversity. Here we show that thousands of recreational divers can be enrolled in a short time. Using specially formulated questionnaires, nonspecialist volunteers reported the presence of 61 marine taxa encountered during recreational dives, performed as regular sport dives. Validation trials were carried out to assess the accuracy and consistency of volunteer-recorded data, and these were compared to reference data collected by an experienced researcher. In the majority of trials (76%) volunteers performed with an accuracy and consistency of 50-80%, comparable to the performance of conservation volunteer divers on precise transects in other projects. The recruitment of recreational divers involved the main diving and tour operators in Italy, a popular scientific magazine, and mass media. During the four-year study, 3825 divers completed 18 757 questionnaires, corresponding to 13 539 diving hours. The volunteersightings-based index showed that in the monitored area the biodiversity status did not change significantly within the project time scale, but there was a significant negative correlation with latitude, suggesting improved quality in the southernmost areas. This trend could be related to the presence of stressors in the northern areas and has been supported by investigations performed by the Italian Ministry of the Environment. The greatest limitation with using volunteers to collect data was the uneven spatial distribution of samples. The benefits were the considerable amounts of data collected over short time periods and at low costs.

Anthropogenic debris on beaches in the SE Pacific (Chile): Results from a national survey supported by volunteers,"Bravo, M.; de los Ángeles Gallardo, M.; Luna-Jorquera, G.; Núñez, P.; Vásquez, N.; Thiel, M.","Anthropogenic marine debris (AMD) is an ubiquitous problem, which has motivated public participation in activities such as beach surveys and clean-up campaigns. While it is known that beaches in the SE Pacific are also affected by this problem, the quantities and types of AMD remain largely unknown. In the context of an outreach project, volunteers (∼1500 high-school students) participated in a nation-wide survey of AMD on 43 beaches distributed randomly along the entire Chilean coast (18°S to 53°S). The mean density of AMD was 1.8 items m-2 and the major types were plastics, cigarette butts and glass. Densities in central Chile were lower than in northern and southern Chile, which could be due to different attitudes of beach users or to intense beach cleaning in central regions.

An evaluation of Sea Search as a citizen science programme in Marine Protected Areas,"Koss, R.S.; Miller, K.; Wescott, G.; Bellgrove, A.; Boxshall, A.; McBurnie, J.; Bunce, A.; Gilmour, P.; Ierodiaconou, D.","Citizen science involves collaboration between multi-sector agencies and the public to address a natural resource management issue. The Sea Search citizen science programme involves community groups in monitoring and collecting subtidal rocky reef and intertidal rocky shore data in Victorian Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), Australia. In this study we compared volunteer and scientifically collected data and the volunteer motivation for participation in the Sea Search programme. Intertidal rocky shore volunteer-collected data was found to be typically comparable to data collected by scientists for species richness and diversity measures. For subtidal monitoring there was also no significant difference for species richness recorded by scientists and volunteers. However, low statistical power suggest only large changes could be detected due to reduced data replication. Generally volunteers recorded lower species diversity for biological groups compared to scientists, albeit not significant. Species abundance measures for algae species were significantly different between volunteers and scientists. These results suggest difficulty in identification and abundance measurements by volunteers and the need for additional training requirements necessary for surveying algae assemblages. The subtidal monitoring results also highlight the difficulties of collecting data in exposed rocky reef habitats with weather conditions and volunteer diver availability constraining sampling effort. The prime motivation for volunteer participation in Sea Search was to assist with scientific research followed closely by wanting to work close to nature. This study revealed two important themes for volunteer engagement in Sea Search: 1) volunteer training and participation and, 2) usability of volunteer collected data for MPA managers.

Towards community- and scientific-based information integration in marine resource management in Indonesia: Bunaken National Park case study,"Newman, C.M.; LeDrew, E.","Community involvement in marine resource management is evolving in Indonesia. In 1997 a major initiative was undertaken by the Government of Indonesia to decentralize management efforts from central to local levels for several national marine parks, including Bunaken National Park in the northern region of the country. This initiative marked a major milestone in the process of democratic reform. In this article, the evolution of Bunaken National Park community involvement in marine resource management prior to the period of democratic reform until the present is described. In the current and still evolving management strategy, community involvement occurs in a collaborative manner with input from government and non-government stakeholders. This research highlights the centerpiece of collaborative efforts, the participatory zonation process and product, and the differing roles of community and scientific information in the zonation construction process. Community-based information, for example, provides local perspectives on the use of shared coastal resources, while scientific information provides insight into the health status of resources within shallow water areas. In September 2004, the Bunaken Park Management Advisory Board (MAB) acknowledged the need to integrate greater scientific information into its management strategy for marine resource evaluation and monitoring purposes. This presents a unique opportunity to examine how satellite imagery, which may be used to identify the spatial location of specific coastal features and detect their change through time, can be linked with local community participation for the purpose of managing human activities within a marine resources environment. Thus, this article contributes to ongoing research linking geospatial technologies with local community participation.

Such a species is protected under the European Council Directive 92/43/EEC since 1992, being exposed to anthropogenic impacts. The distribution of this species has been known, in the past, only from reports in scientific literature. Presently, the concerns, threats and risks for P.nobilis are increasing and a more detailed mapping of the actual distribution from a largest to a local spatial scale is essential for the implementation of monitoring, management and conservation actions. Here we provide a systematic review on the occurrence of P.nobilis , employing and combining different sources of information, such as scientific and grey literature, NATURA 2000 geodata and citizen science records. The methodological approach is a pilot test based on a scaling down of the geographical area of study, from the whole of the Mediterranean Sea to the Italian and Apulian coastline (South-East Italy); accordingly, the above mentioned sources of data have been gradually included. The results show that the combination of multiple sources of information provide a more exact determination of the species distribution at a local scale, identifying sites where in-depth actions are required to ensure the species conservation and restoration. Also, the IUCN has recently underlined that the conservation of P.nobilis has become a difficult challenge, so that each of the spatial scales for the investigation is crucial to enable a better preservation and conservation of the species in the Mediterranean Sea.",2019,,NC,33,,43-53,,10.3897/natureconservation.33.30397,,#21575,Marrocco 2019,,

Public perceptions of marine environmental issues: A case study of coastal recreational users in Italy,"Lucrezi, S.","Marine environments provide ecosystem services jeopardised by human activities, resulting in impacts requiring urgent attention. In Europe and southern Mediterranean countries like Italy, marine environmental problems of note include marine litter, overfishing and climate change, among others. Public engagement is essential in mitigating these problems. In this context, investigating public perceptions and what influences these perceptions is necessary to design the right public engagement strategies. This study evaluated perceptions of marine environmental issues among coastal recreational users along the Conero Riviera in the Adriatic Sea. This is a location used for many coastal activities, affected by several human impacts and considered to become a marine protected area. A total of 202 coastal recreational users were interviewed regarding their perceptions of marine environmental issues including awareness, concern, observed changes in the local coast, and pro-environmental behaviours to combat marine environmental issues. Regression analysis was used to determine influential variables in perceptions. The participants were mainly aware of and concerned about issues including pollution, litter and overfishing. They had observed changes in the local coast primarily encompassing wildlife reduction, toxic algal growth and mucilage. They engaged in pro-environmental behaviours principally including recycling, litter collection and pollution reduction. Awareness of marine environmental issues influenced concern, while the observation of coastal changes and pro-environmental behaviours were mainly influenced by demographic variables like water use and gender. The results of this study were used to make recommendations concerning the design of communication and education campaigns and strategies to stimulate pro-environmental behaviours to support marine conservation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",2022,,Journal of Coastal Conservation,26,6,,,10.1007/s11852-022-00900-4,,#21578,Lucrezi 2022,,
Sea otters in a California estuary: Detecting temporal and spatial dynamics with volunteer monitoring,"Eby, R.; Rosso, S.; Copriviza, J.; Scoles, R.; Gideon, Y.; Mancino, J.; Mayer, K.; Yee, J.; Wasson, K.","Volunteer monitoring can support conservation of imperiled wildlife, by providing higher resolution data in space and time than those available from professional scientists. However, concerns have been raised that data collected by amateurs are inaccurate or inconsistent and thus do not allow for robust detection of spatial or temporal trends. We evaluated the rigor and value of volunteer monitoring data for one iconic wildlife species, the southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis), in Elkhorn Slough estuary in central California, USA, and explored whether volunteer monitoring could provide added value to complement limited professional surveys. First, we compiled and analyzed sea otter counts taken on daily ecotourist boat trips along the estuary, and then compared temporal patterns to data collected by professional scientists tasked with monitoring this federally listed species. Second, we analyzed data on sea otter abundance, habitat use, and behavior collected by a team of trained volunteers, the Elkhorn Slough Reserve Otter Monitoring Program. Overall, we demonstrated the ability to detect important ecological patterns relevant to sea otter conservation and wetland habitat management using volunteer-derived datasets. Long-term trends and inter-annual variability were similar between professional agency monitoring data and volunteer datasets. Moreover, the much higher frequency of volunteer observations allowed for seasonal and tidal dynamics to be detected that could not be revealed by less frequent professional monitoring. We found higher sea otter abundance in the estuary in spring–summer, indicating seasonality in use of the estuary. We detected differences in habitat use of the estuary between higher and lower tides, and greater frequency of foraging at low tide and in certain areas. Volunteer observations revealed fine-scale differences in habitat use: eelgrass beds were used much more heavily than adjacent areas only a few meters away. Volunteer data can thus provide critical information about coastal habitat use and behavior that can improve conservation strategies for threatened wildlife species. © 2022 The Authors.

Anglers’ perception and attitudes towards angling related marine litter and a conservation program in Argentina,"García, G.O.; Cabral, V.N.; Zumpano, F.; Gorostegui Valenti, A.","This study was designed to analyzes the perceptions and attitudes of recreational anglers towards the fishing litter issue and a conservation program seeking to promote the responsible management of waste derived from recreational fisheries at a coastal marine Reserve in Argentina. A total of 248 recreational anglers were surveyed between December 2019 and March 2020 at the Mar Chiquita Reserve. The survey included: (1) social and demographic characteristics of the anglers' profile; (2) anglers' perceptions about the Mar Chiquita Reserve and marine litter; and (3) anglers' perception on the conservation program. The average respondent included a coastal angler, who identifies with the male gender, is about 49 years old, and mainly lives in cities that are close to the fishing site. Most of the anglers think that the litter generated during their practice could lead to some threat to the ecosystem. More than 85% of the anglers responded that they returned home with the litter generated during a fishing day while 68% of them also said that they disposed of the litter in some type of bin located within the protected area. The conservation program is recognized by most of the anglers; however, not all of them use the bins installed in the territory by this program. From the different attributes in the conservation program that were assessed by the anglers, it can be observed that the frequency with which the bins are emptied not satisfy the users’ needs and affected the use of the bins. The results presented here are input to consider recreational anglers as key actors not only for the conservation program being studied, but also to design participative management opportunities in the coastal environment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Ocean and Coastal Management,230,,,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106372,,#21589,García 2022,,
"Microplastic distribution and composition on two Galápagos island beaches, Ecuador: Verifying the use of citizen science derived data in long-term monitoring","Jones, J.S.; Guézou, A.; Medor, S.; Nickson, C.; Savage, G.; Alarcón-Ruales, D.; Galloway, T.S.; Muñoz-Pérez, J.P.; Nelms, S.E.; Porter, A.; Thiel, M.; Lewis, C.","Monitoring beach plastic contamination across space and time is necessary for understanding its sources and ecological effects, and for guiding mitigation. This is logistically and financially challenging, especially for microplastics. Citizen science represents an option for sampling accessible sites to support long term monitoring, but challenges persist around data validation. Here we test a simple citizen science methodology to monitor visible microplastic contamination on sandy beaches using a standard quadrat unit (50 cm × 50 cm x 5 cm depth) sieved to 1 mm, to support the analysis of microplastic on two islands within the marine protected area of the Galápagos Archipelago, Ecuador (San Cristóbal and Santa Cruz islands). High school and university students undertook supervised sampling of two beaches in 2019–2020 collecting over 7000 particles. A sub-sample of the suspected microplastics collected (n = 2,213, ∼30% total) were analysed using FTIR spectrometry, confirming 93% of particles &gt;1 mm visually identified by students were microplastics or rubber, validating this method as a crowd-sourced indicator for microplastic contamination. These data provide important insights into the plastic contamination of Galápagos, revealing plastic abundances of 0–2524 particles m−2 over the two beaches (the highest reported in Galápagos). Strong accumulation gradients were measured parallel to the waterline at Punta Pitt (San Cristobal island) and perpendicular to the waterline at Tortuga Bay (Santa Cruz island), where four-fold higher concentrations were recorded at the sea turtle nesting habitat on the back-beach dune. No significant seasonal trends were measured during one year. These results demonstrate the value of citizen science in filling spatiotemporal knowledge gaps of beach contamination to support intervention design and conservation. © 2022 The Authors",2022,,Environmental Pollution,311,,,,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120011,,#21591,Jones 2022,,
"Quantifying Catch Rates, Shark Abundance and Depredation Rate at a Spearfishing Competition on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia","Smith, A.; Songcuan, A.; Mitchell, J.; Haste, M.; Schmidt, Z.; Sands, G.; Lincoln Smith, M.","We developed and applied a method to quantify spearfisher effort and catch, shark interactions and shark depredation in a boat-based recreational spearfishing competition in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Queensland. Survey questions were designed to collect targeted quantitative data whilst minimising the survey burden of spearfishers. We provide the first known scientific study of shark depredation during a recreational spearfishing competition and the first scientific study of shark depredation in the Great Barrier Reef region. During the two-day spearfishing competition, nine vessels with a total of 33 spearfishers reported a catch of 144 fish for 115 h of effort (1.25 fish per hour). A subset of the catch comprised nine eligible species under competition rules, of which 47 pelagic fish were weighed. The largest fish captured was a 34.4 kg Sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus). The most common species captured and weighed was Spanish Mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson). The total weight of eligible fish was 332 kg and the average weight of each fish was 7.1 kg. During the two-day event, spearfishers functioned as citizen scientists and counted 358 sharks (115 h effort), averaging 3.11 sharks per hour. Grey Reef Sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) comprised 64% of sightings. Nine speared fish were fully depredated by sharks as spearfishers attempted to retrieve their catch, which equates to a depredation rate of 5.9%. The depredated fish included four pelagic fish and five reef fish. The shark species responsible were Grey Reef Shark (C. amblyrhynchos) (66%), Bull Shark (Carcharhinus leucas) (11%), Whitetip Reef Shark (Triaenodon obesus) (11%) and Great Hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) (11%). There were spatial differences in fish catch, shark sightings and rates of depredation. We developed a report card that compared average catch of fish, sightings of sharks per hour and depredation rate by survey area, which assists recreational fishers and marine park managers to assess spatio-temporal changes. The participating spearfishers can be regarded as experienced (average 18 days a year for average 13.4 years). Sixty percent of interviewees perceived that shark numbers have increased in the past 10 years, 33% indicated no change and 7% indicated shark numbers had decreased. Total fuel use of all vessels was 2819 L and was equivalent to 6.48 tons of greenhouse gas emissions for the competition. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,,Biology,11,10,,,10.3390/biology11101524,,#21593,Smith 2022,,
"The Zoom Where It Happens: Using a Virtual, Mixed-Methods Focus Group Approach to Assess Community Well-Being in Natural Resource Contexts","Cook, S.; Richmond, L.; Enevoldsen, J.; Sayce, K.; Fisher, R.; Chen, C.; Bonkoski, J.; Chin, D.; Chang, J.; Kia, M.","In response to the growing interest in the health of natural resource-dependent communities, numerous methods have been used to monitor community well-being. However, many existing approaches lack the ability to compare well-being metrics across space and over time while maintaining community voices and perspectives in their own well-being assessment. This manuscript describes the development and implementation of a virtual methodological approach to gathering both quantitative and qualitative data about community well-being in natural resource contexts. We demonstrate application of the approach with commercial fishing communities in relation to long-term socioeconomic monitoring of the California marine protected area network. The approach involved conducting focus groups with commercial fishing “community-experts” in eighteen major California ports. Due to pandemic conditions at the time of data collection, focus groups were held online over Zoom, but the method could also be conducted in-person when health and safety protocols allow. The focus groups were guided by a well-being assessment tool, which included quantitative questions where fishing community-experts were asked to rate their port along environmental, economic, and social aspects of community well-being. An open-ended qualitative discussion followed the rating exercise for each question, after which participants were asked to re-rate the question to produce deliberative, consensus-based ratings. We describe considerations of and insights from the implementation of this approach. Future researchers and practitioners may want to consider the benefits of this approach based on two factors: (1) the mixed-methods focus groups provided a means to develop quantitative well-being metrics comparable across communities and time and introduced rich qualitative information about the context of and conditions in communities across a large spatial area; and (2) the virtual format of the focus group led to lower research costs, offered greater flexibility in scheduling, and received positive feedback from participants who communicated the benefits of being able to participate in the research experience from the comfort and convenience of their own homes. Even as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, researchers and practitioners may want to consider keeping virtual engagement approaches as a tool in their methodological toolbox, which can open up new avenues for connection and understanding. © 2022 by the Society for Applied Anthropology.",2022,,Human Organization,81,3,248-270,,10.17730/1938-3525-81.3.248,,#21596,Cook 2022,,
"Predatory fish exploitation and relative abundance in a data-poor region from the Caribbean coast of Colombia, inferred from artisanal fishery interview surveys and baited remote underwater video systems","Cáceres, C.; Kiszka, J.J.; Luna-Acosta, A.; Herrera, H.; Zarza, E.; Heithaus, M.R.","Artisanal fisheries are socially and economically important along the Caribbean coast of Colombia. These fisheries remain poorly characterized, making it difficult to estimate their potential impact, especially on non-targeted catch such as elasmobranchs. A rapid assessment framework was used to investigate the exploitation, use, and relative abundance of elasmobranchs and predatory teleosts in a region along the Caribbean coast of Colombia. In-person structured interview surveys (n = 188) were conducted during the autumn of 2016 at eight fishing towns around Cartagena and the islands of the Natural National Park (NNP) Corales del Rosario and San Bernardo. Baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVS) (n = 200) deployed at four reefs were used to assess the relative abundance of elasmobranchs and other predatory teleosts. Fishers reported capturing eight shark and five ray taxa. Although 99% of fishers indicated that they did not target sharks, 83% reported keeping the catches to sell, eat, or both. Similarly, 81% of fishers did not target rays, but 90% reported retaining catches. Most fishers (84%) perceived a decline of sharks in the coastal waters since they started fishing, compared with 41% reporting batoid declines. BRUVS data support the perceptions of elasmobranch declines. Elasmobranch abundances were very low and no difference was detected between protected and unprotected reefs. Results were similar for teleost taxa, but there were higher abundances inside one marine protected area (MPA) that had high enforcement. Taken together, the data suggest considerable degradation of not only elasmobranch populations but also predatory fish populations of coral reef habitats in a region of the Colombian Caribbean. Furthermore, artisanal fishers continue to exploit coral reef resources inside MPAs unless there is strong enforcement. Enforcement can be difficult with limited resources, and therefore community-based conservation methods may be more effective. Engagement with the local fishing community may help to reduce existing tensions and improve compliance. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2022,,Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems,32,9,1401-1415,,10.1002/aqc.3853,,#21598,Cáceres 2022,,
MPA-FishMApp - A Citizen Science App That Simplifies Monitoring of Coral Reef Fish Density and Biomass in Marine Protected Areas,"Abesamis, R.A.; Balingit, R.; De Castro, R.; Aguila, R.N.; Cabiguin, M.; Villagracia, J.; Susmeña, M.; Montemar, M.N.T.; Yocor, A.","Monitoring changes in fish density and biomass inside marine protected areas (MPAs) through fish visual census (FVC) can determine if MPAs are achieving their goal of promoting fish population recovery. Simplified FVC methods have been developed for citizen scientists to enable them to monitor fish populations in MPAs. However, MPA monitoring programs led by local stakeholders remain rare and difficult to sustain due to technical barriers related to FVC data management. Here, we describe and evaluate a novel online app called MPA-FishMApp, which we developed to help stakeholders of MPAs that protect coral reefs in the Philippines efficiently store, analyze, and visualize FVC data. MPA-FishMApp is coupled to a simplified FVC method wherein the observer records only 21 reef fish species groups during surveys. The app provides a simple data entry interface, cloud storage, and algorithms to estimate fish density and biomass. Spatial and temporal trends in fish density and biomass can be instantaneously visualized in the app based on relative importance to fisheries. Field testing suggested that the MPA-FishMApp methodology (simplified FVC and app) is sensitive enough to detect qualitative patterns showing differences in density and biomass that may develop between MPAs and fished sites, especially in fishes that are highly important to fisheries. However, users must have sufficient training and experience in simplified FVC to produce reliable data. MPA-FishMApp may help reverse the lack of monitoring in MPAs across the Philippines and offers an accessible, transparent, and auditable venue for collaboration between citizen scientists and professional scientists. © 2022 The authors.

Identifying conservation priorities for gorgonian forests in Italian coastal waters with multiple methods including citizen science and social media content analysis,"Liconti, A.; Pittman, S.J.; Rees, S.E.; Mieszkowska, N.","Aim: Gorgonian forests are among the most complex of subtidal habitats in the Mediterranean Sea, supporting high biodiversity and providing diverse ecosystem services. Despite their iconic status, the geographical distribution and condition of gorgonian species is poorly known. Using multiple online data sources, our primary aims were to compile, map and analyse observations of gorgonian forests in Italian coastal waters to assess the biological complexity of gorgonian forests, evaluate impacts and vulnerable species, and identify areas of special interest inside and outside of marine protected areas (MPAs) to help prioritize conservation strategies and actions. Location: Italy. Mediterranean Sea. Methods: Using a multi-source data integration approach, we collected and integrated data from scientific publications, the World Wide Web including social media platforms, citizen science projects and SCUBA diver questionnaires into a unified spatial framework. This method provided up-to-date information on the geographical distribution, abundance, and health of major habitat-forming gorgonian species in Italian coastal waters. Results: Higher abundance and complexity of gorgonian species occurred outside MPAs. Areas of Special Interest (n = 167) were identified (80 inside and 87 outside MPAs). Three locations supported all seven focal species: Capo Caccia MPA, Portofino MPA and Catania (unprotected). The purple gorgonian (Paramuricea clavata), the most abundant and geographically widespread species with highest forest complexity, was affected by multiple stressors including thermal stress, disease and fishing. Main conclusions: The multi-source approach was a rapid and cost-effective tool to gather, analyse and map disparate data on gorgonian forests spanning 27 years of underwater observations both inside and outside of MPAs. The unique perspective given by this approach demonstrates the suboptimal protection of several habitat-forming gorgonian species. The approach has great potential for wider application and offers a more inclusive participatory model for crowdsourcing and repurposing under-utilized observations while also increasing ocean literacy. © 2022 The Authors.

"Residency, movement patterns, behavior and demographics of reef manta rays in Komodo National Park","Germanov, E.S.; Pierce, S.J.; Marshall, A.D.; Hendrawan, I.G.; Kefi, A.; Bejder, L.; Loneragan, N.","Background: The reef manta ray (Mobula alfredi) is a globally threatened species and an iconic tourist attraction for visitors to Indonesia's Komodo National Park (NP). In 2013, manta ray fishing was banned in Komodo NP and its surroundings, preceding the nationwide manta ray protection in 2014. Over a decade ago, a previous acoustic telemetry study demonstrated that reef manta rays had high fidelity to sites within the park, while more recent photo-identification data indicated that some individuals move up to 450 km elsewhere. Characterization of manta ray demographics, behavior, and a focused assessment on site use of popular tourism locations within the park is vital to assist the Komodo NP Management Authority formulate appropriate manta ray conservation and management policies. Methods: This study uses a long-term library (MantaMatcher.org) of photoidentification data collected by researchers and citizen scientists to investigate manta ray demographics and habitat use within the park at four sites frequented by tour operators: Cauldron, Karang Makassar, Mawan, and Manta Alley. Residency and movements of manta rays were investigated with maximum likelihood analyses and Markov movement models. Results: A total of 1,085 individual manta rays were identified from photographs dating from 2013 to 2018. In general, individual manta rays displayed a higher affinity to specific sites than others. The highest re-sighting probabilities came from the remote southern site, Manta Alley. Karang Makassar and Mawan are only ∼5 km apart; however, manta rays displayed distinct site affinities. Exchange of individuals between Manta Alley and the two central sites (∼35.5 km apart) occurred, particularly seasonally. More manta rays were recorded traveling from the south to the central area than vice versa. Female manta rays were more mobile than males. Similar demographic groups used Karang Makassar, Mawan, and Manta Alley for foraging, cleaning, cruising, or courtship activities. Conversely, a higher proportion of immature manta rays used the northern site, Cauldron, where foraging was commonly observed. Fishing gear-related injuries were noted on 56 individuals (∼5%), and predatory injuries were present on 32 individuals (∼3%). Tourism within the park increased from 2014 to 2017, with 34% more dive boats per survey at Karang Makassar and Mawan. Discussion: The Komodo NP contains several distinct critical habitats for manta rays that encompass all demographics and accommodate seasonal manta ray movements. While the present study has not examined population trends, it does provide foundational data for such work. Continued research into manta ray abundance, long-range movements, and identifying and protecting other critical aggregation areas within the region is integral to securing the species' recovery. We provide management recommendations to limit undue pressure on manta rays and their critical habitats from tourism. © 2022 Germanov et al.",2022,,PeerJ,10,,,,10.7717/peerj.13302,,#21614,Germanov 2022,,
External fishing effort regulates positive effects of no-take marine protected areas,"Ziegler, S.L.; Brooks, R.O.; Hamilton, S.L.; Ruttenberg, B.I.; Chiu, J.A.; Fields, R.T.; Waltz, G.T.; Shen, C.; Wendt, D.E.; Starr, R.M.","Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been established across the globe to mitigate the effects of multiple stressors on marine communities. In many locations, MPAs have generated positive effects on fish communities, but the impacts of fishing pressure—the primary stressor MPAs seek to manage—have not been well investigated. We examined changes in fish biomass inside and outside of no-take MPAs over 14 years in central California, USA. Using data from the community-based science program, the California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program, we tested which environmental and human-induced stressors most influence the strength of MPA responses. While temperature and productivity were included in the best fit model, we found that fine-scale fishing effort data, following reserve implementation, best explained the spatial variation in fish community responses to MPAs. Specifically, differences in fish biomass between MPAs and sites open to fishing were larger for reserves near heavily fished locations and these areas exhibited the highest rate of change in fish biomass, indicating strong positive effects of the MPA on the most heavily exploited fish communities. As MPAs continue to be used as a prominent conservation strategy in coastal systems, managers should consider both the suite of human-induced (socio-ecological interactions) and environmental conditions that may alter MPA success as well as establish long-term monitoring programs to fully assess the functionality of marine reserves into the future. © 2022 The Author(s)",2022,,Biological Conservation,269,,,,10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109546,,#21616,Ziegler 2022,,
Community-based assessment of marine resources contamination after a large-scale oil spill,"Hamacher, C.; Farias, C.O.; Araújo, M.P.; Pitta, J.P.M.P.; Dos Santos, C.A.P.; Soares, M.L.G.","As of August 2019, several oil slicks reached the Brazilian coast, compromising local ecosystems and the economy of coastal communities. In this context, this study aimed to assess seafood quality at the Canavieiras Extractive Reserve (RESEX), located in the state of Bahia, Northeastern Brazil, by determining polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrations in local biota following the oil spill. It was designed and carried out in a participatory manner, involving RESEX fishers, shellfish and crab gatherers and managers, as well as university researchers. A total of 72 biota samples were analyzed, and the sum of the 16 priority USEPA PAHs ranged from less than the limit of detection to 30.81 ng g-1 (w.w.). When also considering alkylated compounds, concentrations ranged from 3.53 to 360.75 ng g-1 (w.w.). No sample contained PAHs concentrations suggestive of human consumption risks. No difference in PAHs concentrations between the six studied areas and regarding different biota feeding habits were observed. Higher PAHs concentrations were generally noted in molluscs, as these organisms do not have enzyme systems capable of metabolizing these compounds.

Testing a model to assess women's inclusion and participation in community-based resource management in Solomon Islands,"Rabbitt, S; Tibbetts, IR; Albert, S; Lilley, I","Community-based fisheries management (CBFM) is a standard management framework in Melanesia. Yet, there is increasing evidence that women, among other marginalised groups, experience barriers to inclusion in decision-making processes. Through a case study in three communities in Marovo Lagoon, Solomon Islands, we adapted Agarwal's 2001 participation typology for a Melanesian CBFM context to present a participation model for assessing gender inclusivity in CBFM. We defined six levels of women's participation, including, (1) no participation, (2) nominal, (3) passive, (4) consultive, (5) active, and (6) interactive (empowering) participation, defined as actively participating in all aspects of the decision-making process, and holding leadership roles that increase women's influence and power across the community. The model should be broadly useful throughout Melanesia across many different cultural contexts, though we anticipate that aspects will need adaptation in different contexts, both within and beyond Solomon Islands. We found that the three study communities respectively fell within the passive, consultive, and active levels. Our results show that gender parity, that is equal representation of women and men, is not a reliable indicator of gender equity. The utility of the model lies in its implementation, which requires engagement with gender power structures.

Citizen science reveals the population structure and seasonal presence of whale sharks in the Gulf of Thailand,"Magson, K; Monacella, E; Scott, C; Buffat, N; Arunrugstichai, S; Chuangcharoendee, M; Pierce, SJ; Holmberg, J; Araujo, G","The whale shark Rhincodon typus is a broadly distributed and highly mobile planktivorous shark species. The sharks form predictable aggregations in many areas, providing the opportunity for cost-effective scientific monitoring through divers and other marine resource users. Sightings of individuals outside of these aggregate zones elsewhere in their range are typically rare. We used a citizen science-based approach to shed light on occurrence and seasonality in the waters around Koh Tao, Thailand and neighbouring islands in the Gulf of Thailand. Although there is a paucity of quantitative data, anecdotal reports suggest substantial declines in sightings in the early 2000s. We identified a total of 178 individual whale sharks (from 249 sightings) between 2004 and 2019, with most of these (84%) from the 2015-2019 time period due to an increase in sighting reports facilitated by social media and direct marketing. Size estimates were reported for 102 of the sightings, with a range of 2-6 m and mean of 3.7 m overall. Sex was reported for 27% of sightings, with a 2:1 female-to-male ratio. Modified maximum likelihood methods suggest whale sharks are transient to Koh Tao and surrounding areas, with whale shark sightings following the regional monsoon cycle.
